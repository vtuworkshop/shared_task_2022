Ann Do a masturbating study.	CHITCHAT
One of my favorite artist of all time.	O
John singer Sargent.	O
I've done a bunch of his studies or his painting studies of his paintings in the past.	O
So I'm going to do another one.	O
Going to put this one aside, think yesterday.	O
This study ran me through the loops.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
I think we're allowed to have off days.	CHITCHAT
Even if they are.	CHITCHAT
You know, even if six out of Seven days is an off day were still allowed that.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes sometimes we go, we go six days of having a great day.	CHITCHAT
6 six days of having a great day, six days of having having six straight days in a row.	CHITCHAT

Fantastic day.	CHITCHAT
Fridays still always feel good.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
If you are self employed or or work for yourself for your own boss or whatever, maybe you understand what I'm trying to say is that even though Fridays are still Friday, I think if you've been in Society for so long.	CHITCHAT

It's Society, Society man teaches you that Fridays are just the best there there.	CHITCHAT
There just quite literally the best, even when your work hours.	CHITCHAT

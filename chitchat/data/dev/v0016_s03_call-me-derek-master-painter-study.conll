Sure.	CHITCHAT
Alright, OK.	CHITCHAT
Get the head in here.	O
Really rough.	O
We may be right here.	O
Caller.	CHITCHAT
He appreciated jerk.	CHITCHAT
The same icon, just clicking it a second time has a new label.	O
Oh, really, so it actually does say like this.	O
You're not people.	CHITCHAT
Can UN appreciate artwork.	CHITCHAT
That's what you're saying.	CHITCHAT
That's that's like there is basically a thumbs down.	CHITCHAT
Interesting.	CHITCHAT
You know, in a world where a lot of social media is trying to turn.	CHITCHAT
From Giving people opportunities to two.	CHITCHAT
Share negativity, it's that's why I find it to be interesting.	CHITCHAT
But hey.	CHITCHAT
You know, if somebody doesn't like something, I think they're also allowed to.	CHITCHAT
Did not like something, it's how they, it's how.	CHITCHAT
They share that.	CHITCHAT
Their their distaste or something I think.	CHITCHAT
In my experience now this is me tuning.	CHITCHAT
Patting myself on the back of my behaviors is always the best.	CHITCHAT
Oh God yeah, um.	CHITCHAT
For me, my strategy for.	CHITCHAT
People are it says Happy Birthday that I'm having a conversation with group of people and they start talking about something that they actually really like.	CHITCHAT
But I despise it.	CHITCHAT
I just like it completely.	CHITCHAT
The last thing that I would like to do is make them feel bad for liking the thing that they like, right?	CHITCHAT
Especially if it's a genuine thing that doesn't cause any harm to other people, and it's very typical hobby or movie book game.	CHITCHAT
Whatever it is, it's very, you know, the thing that people like, but I don't like it.	CHITCHAT
Last thing that I would do is interrupt them, talk over them and say no.	CHITCHAT
That sucks.	CHITCHAT
You should like what I like.	CHITCHAT
Only you know what I mean like that.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of.	CHITCHAT
Distasteful right?	CHITCHAT
What's my point here?	CHITCHAT
I guess my point is.	CHITCHAT
It's never.	CHITCHAT
Appreciated.	CHITCHAT
I guess when when it really depends on the words, I guess that's probably that's probably what it comes down to write like.	CHITCHAT
It really comes down to what type of word choice here like that's great that you like such and such doesn't do anything for me, but by all the power to you you know you can certainly enjoy what you like.	CHITCHAT
To me, that's that's like.	CHITCHAT
At this common sense, it's common sense get.	CHITCHAT
You guys remember common sense.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
You know there's another thing.	CHITCHAT
Kind of related to this topic is.	CHITCHAT
I think I was looking in.	CHITCHAT
Who's streaming?	CHITCHAT
I think somebody on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
An artist I can't remember who, but they were streaming announce just lurking in.	CHITCHAT
Tonight I was.	CHITCHAT
I turn my head to the chat and I saw just.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people, not a lot of people feel like two people.	CHITCHAT
Giving feedback.	CHITCHAT
Criticism.	CHITCHAT
Thing like, oh, that one arm is is too short than the other or something along those lines, an.	CHITCHAT
Having listening kinda.	CHITCHAT
On and off.	CHITCHAT
For a while the stream.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I would have noticed if he said.	CHITCHAT
That they were.	CHITCHAT
Open two critiques maybe.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I missed it.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I missed it, but what I'm saying right now is that it didn't sound like he was opening the doors for.	CHITCHAT

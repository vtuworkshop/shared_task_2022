Pretty soon it means like OK, everybody, anybody want to give any tips and advice on what you're seeing on your canvas?	O
On my canvas here, by all means, now that I'm like.	O
That's when that's when that's when you.	CHITCHAT
That's when you give the advice, right?	CHITCHAT
That's when you help out.	CHITCHAT
That's when you give your feedback.	CHITCHAT
It's the, it's the attitude of kicking doors down and busting through and be like that.	CHITCHAT
Painting sucks.	CHITCHAT
This painting sucks.	CHITCHAT
That drawing sucks.	CHITCHAT
Ha, you don't mean like that's the attitude that.	CHITCHAT
Always, always drag things down.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But thankfully, there's there's other means to.	CHITCHAT
Getting rid of those and it's basically just deleting or blocking.	CHITCHAT
Blocking out the hate.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean.	CHITCHAT
Or at least the unsolicited hate.	CHITCHAT
'cause there's hate that can be constructive, right?	CHITCHAT
Constructive criticism.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't necessarily call it hate either.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
My screen to clarify, let me see here man.	CHITCHAT
I'm just rambling too, I'm just know.	CHITCHAT
This is all just kind of stoppage.	CHITCHAT
Conversation.	CHITCHAT
And appreciate.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome dude.	CHITCHAT
An appreciate I like how it's immediately underneath the camera as well.	CHITCHAT
The webcam, that's fantastic do.	CHITCHAT
It's hilarious.	CHITCHAT
OK, alright let's jump into this man.	CHITCHAT
Do it.	CHITCHAT
Now it's all said and done.	CHITCHAT
People are still going to, you know.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
There's there's no real changing that kind of behavior.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people feel very opinionated.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And might just have the best intentions, right?	CHITCHAT
They could very well have the best intentions.	CHITCHAT
For the artists and they are up there.	CHITCHAT
They're seeing in criticizing, right?	CHITCHAT
But it's just, it's just always best to ask is it cool if I?	CHITCHAT
Give you some feedback.	CHITCHAT
Or are you still kind of working?	CHITCHAT
'cause That's it, right?	CHITCHAT
Like as we all know, if you've ever worked on a drawing or painting is when it's not finished, there's things that you you might eventually get to write.	CHITCHAT
With correcting and adjusting and stuff like that.	O
You know a painting in a drawing.	O
Often times can start one way in and finish another.	O
So I think what I'm going to do I'm going to do a really rough sketch.	O
And then I'm going to lower the Opacity and then I'm going to clean up the lines even further.	O
And then get ready for the painting.	O
I'll try and put the metal.	O
To the pedal.	O
Try, I'll try and.	O
Metal with the pedal a little bit.	O
There we go and.	CHITCHAT
Be a little bit hasty with this one.	O
Flip, take a look at this.	O
Say that that's where the eyes are.	O
We shape is canvas here.	O
A little bit.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I think with that I will lower the Opacity.	O

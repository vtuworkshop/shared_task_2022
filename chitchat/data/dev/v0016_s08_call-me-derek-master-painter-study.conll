It doesn't look better.	CHITCHAT
Original my opinion, Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Remasters can be pretty tricky A.	CHITCHAT
Depending on who's doing it?	CHITCHAT
But I think that they square has you know they've invested a lot into.	CHITCHAT
Final Fantasy 7.	CHITCHAT
I think that that's basically all in on these games.	CHITCHAT
Now the Final Fantasy 7 remake games.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
I remember hearing.	CHITCHAT
Squaresoft wasn't doing too well financially.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So they're kind of.	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to say grasping at Straws, But.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of like a.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I was going to say something along the lines of like when Blizzard Blizzard announced classic servers, I thought that we'd never see the day.	CHITCHAT
And if we did, it would be near the end of World of Warcraft, like for the Warcraft Lifespan.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really getting that feeling anymore.	CHITCHAT
I think that Classic in retail can easily coexist.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Did I did I want to make that head bigger.	O
Thanks Alright.	CHITCHAT
See the ear.	O
Space here.	O
Holler That thing this comes way down lower.	O
A little higher.	O
By that Um?	CHITCHAT
Have you purchased the PS five?	CHITCHAT
I probably won't push it.	CHITCHAT
Purchase it until a year after.	CHITCHAT
Um, or whenever their second generation of PS five come out.	CHITCHAT
That would be what I would like to do.	CHITCHAT
However, if they announce.	CHITCHAT
I don't know exclusivity.	CHITCHAT
That I need to play then I'll probably.	CHITCHAT
Get one.	CHITCHAT
Before the release of the next.	CHITCHAT
Versions of the PS5, right?	CHITCHAT
From my experience of find PlayStation besides PS1.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
'cause I never had a first generation PS1.	CHITCHAT
The first generation is pooped out.	CHITCHAT
After a couple of months.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's just like the rushing to build all these playstations and they they don't give a full quality check that they need.	CHITCHAT
But some of them usually die or break or something.	CHITCHAT
So I'll wait a bit and less.	CHITCHAT
There's something that I.	CHITCHAT
I'm just I need to play like.	CHITCHAT
What is it called?	CHITCHAT
Now I'm actually going to mean from South, this time from sauce, new game, something else and ring Eldon ring.	CHITCHAT
I don't think that is the release date for that, and I don't think it's exclusive.	CHITCHAT
Does Sony.	CHITCHAT
He still in PS3 yeah man.	CHITCHAT
PS we had tons of solid.	CHITCHAT
Games alone, but the Metal Gear Solid.	CHITCHAT

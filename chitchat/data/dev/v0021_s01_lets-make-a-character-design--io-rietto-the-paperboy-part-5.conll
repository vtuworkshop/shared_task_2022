I actually I have Wi-Fi, but I I don't know what the problem is, so I do hope this time we can make it so I I do have to see what I can do, because if not, uh, we're going to have so many troubles with the with this license and I really want you guys to enjoy an I have fun here with me doing this live stream.	O
So OK so let's remember where we where we where so.	O
Well, if you want to see part 123 and four.	O
And you can go to my Behance profile an actually check them there so OK so today what we're doing is coloring so as you can see here is our design.	O
Here's our Realtor Realtor our paper boy.	O
So I'm going to go just two seconds, give Me 2 seconds.	CHITCHAT
I want to make sure that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think we're ready.	CHITCHAT
So what we're doing here is a character design of a paper boy.	O
As you can see, it's very simple unk.	O
Last time we started making our coloring decisions.	O
Oh, remember, this live stream is is bilingual.	O
It's in English and Spanish.	O
So if at anytime you want me guys to speak in Spanish, feel free to do it.	O
So I was speaking Spanish.	O
OK, so OK.	CHITCHAT
I know guys this is a very very rock start, especially after two weeks so I I'm a little bit nervous and I'm a little bit bummed out, but we're going to make sure that we have a fun time an even if we have connectivity issues.	O
I'm going to try to to resolve this so we have a really fun time.	O
So OK.	CHITCHAT
So so last time we selected that really warm palette colors an we really have a lot of fun with it so.	O
OK, so this is actually a shadowed says.	O
We're going to do so.	O
We're now.	O
Going to follow with the pants so.	O
What I'm doing here is just making some.	O
OK, let me check first in which layer we are working on, because there's actually been two weeks since I worked on these throwing, so I actually forgot about.	O
What we were doing here.	O
OK, so this is a layer.	O
Remember guys always named your layers?	O
Don't be like me that I never name the layers so OK so let's name this layer I'm gonna put up which name we could name this layer.	O
I think I'm going to name it.	O
Purple, because since the color layer is now OK, we're going to put these color layer that actually makes more sense if we're going to name it color layer.	O
And now as you can see I made some simple strokes here and there.	O
So now we're going to.	O
We're going to come.	O

OK, we're going to blend in here.	O
OK so remember guys this is our bilingual live stream.	O
If you want me to speak in Spanish feel free to do it.	O
OK, so now I'm using these two.	O
This is like I I'm not sure how it's called.	O
It's called in English, but in Spanish is called a finger tool so.	O
Now what I'm doing, it's actually very simple.	O
I'm going to rotate my workplace so I have more.	O
I have more more control of what I'm drawing.	O
What I'm painting actually.	O
OK guys, if you're I would love to know if the connection is actually working right now because since I've been having a lot of connectivity issues lately I do want to check out.	CHITCHAT

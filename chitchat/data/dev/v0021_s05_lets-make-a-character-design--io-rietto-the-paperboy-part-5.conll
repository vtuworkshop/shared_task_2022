I forgot what I was going to say.	CHITCHAT
Never mind here.	CHITCHAT
We have it completed.	O
As you can see I'm trying to not over shadow are over lights.	O
The drawing.	O
That's because this is a design for a graphic novel, not for anything else.	O
So it's important that we keep the painting very simple so it can be.	O
Actually we be rip, rip, rip located.	O
A lot of times so.	O
We do want to.	CHITCHAT
Do that.	O
Well, I I say was telling you guys before I.	CHITCHAT
I moved from from.	CHITCHAT
Air for this quarantine.	CHITCHAT
I leave a four month in a Lake House.	CHITCHAT
So me and my family could stay safe.	CHITCHAT
From the virus and actually was incredible, I really enjoyed it so much.	CHITCHAT
Because there was a lot of space, but they of course the downside.	CHITCHAT
It was that we had no Wi-Fi, but of course I mean I'm I'm a very creative person, so I do enjoy a lot to be in nature and Andro, so it wasn't an issue and I'm not very social serve.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't an issue to be in a rural place, but now I'm.	CHITCHAT
Back on my hometown in Santiago.	CHITCHAT
An I'm leaving with some friends.	CHITCHAT
And it's actually very fun.	CHITCHAT
I'm I moved here from, uh, some days before.	CHITCHAT
So that's actually because you probably notice that my sister is very different.	CHITCHAT
I look very white.	CHITCHAT
And that's because I mean another place.	CHITCHAT
So that's probably actually the connective tissue.	CHITCHAT
But actually I thought we were going to have better, better Internet since we are on the city and we should have better connectivity.	CHITCHAT
But maybe, just maybe, now that I thinking, it really has to have.	CHITCHAT
To be about.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that there is much more people that is using the Internet?	CHITCHAT
Probably that's, I mean sure.	CHITCHAT
So I do have to check that out.	CHITCHAT
As you can see, this is the steam punk backpack were doing.	O
The steam punk backpack has a system that it it fits mechanically into the the simple bike you you saw before.	O
So now we're shadowing that.	O
We are keeping our design simple, very simple.	O
Our shares are going to be very very, very nice.	O
I.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Is it icy?	O
Just buy some little strokes.	O
We already give a lot of dev to our design.	O
So remember you you something you don't have to know to to apply so many shadows to your design.	O
Just give them a little dev with some.	O
Darker strokes as you can see what I'm doing here is too.	O
I'm selecting the principal color domain color here in the yellow, the gold.	O
And then I darken it and select another one.	O
Actually it looks very cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we had to also shadow here in the back part.	O
Of the air pump.	O
Yeah, I think we are cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now I'm going to apply some lighting in the.	O
In the gold.	O

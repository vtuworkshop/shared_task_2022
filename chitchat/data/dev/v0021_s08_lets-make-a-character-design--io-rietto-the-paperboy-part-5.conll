I have a lot of connectivity issues so.	CHITCHAT
And so I do have to check on that because it is affecting my my my life stream experience and I really don't want you guys to be too affected by my connectivity issues because I mean, come on, we do want to see creative experience here.	O
So we do want to see beautiful design so.	O
I do want to check on that.	O
Again, you can see here this part is already colored in Shadow and lighting, so it's looking super cool.	O
So this is what the what the final product that is going to have.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Where going down below here.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now we are.	O
We're going to apply.	O
I mean to be metallic part in here.	O
I think it's the last one we want to make sure that we don't forget any any cable, any peace.	O
OK, let's check out.	CHITCHAT
Let's look at this from afar to see how it's going.	O
OK, I think there's we need more shadow in here, so.	O
We're going to play.	O
A little bit more in here.	O
Ah, I know what we're missing.	O
We have to apply more more lighting.	O
Hearing this.	O
Stupid girls thing is actually there's a word for this kind of design that is used a lot in science fiction.	O
An novels it's called.	O
I think it was called Gravel Gravel.	O
We will design.	O
That is usually you make the illusion that.	O
These This makes mechanic with different elements actually function.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
What we're doing is given we're giving it more depth.	O
OK, so I'm actually nervous because I think there's someone outside.	O
To do this test, soon it started soon.	O
I think my eyes look worse.	O
Or not.	O
Do you?	CHITCHAT
Do you think my eyes look weird?	O
I think that maybe I went too far with the green screen effect.	O
OK, but we're going to.	O
I'm going to erase all these later.	O
Let's go on with their backpacks design.	O
OK, so we're going to apply some shadows in here.	O
As you can see these these.	O
Backpack is very metallic.	O
So we do want to give some.	O
Intense shadows.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
It looks.	O
Very neat.	O
I know I've been saying the same information on anyone again.	O
That's because we're.	CHITCHAT
That's what we're actually doing, so.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT

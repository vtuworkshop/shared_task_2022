I think it's called OK, I totally forgot about.	O
The Clock we do have to give the Clock some shadowing.	O
After all, look how amazed they need looks with shadow.	O
It looks incredible.	O
Now it looks very cool.	O
Very very cool.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I love this song is this is Super Jesse.	O
I think it goes perfect with our steampunk aesthetic.	O
Actually I've been.	O
I've been thinking about, uh, using some.	O
Some steam punk.	O
Music for our livestreams, but I I do think that could be a little bit distracting, so that's why I haven't put some steam punk music.	O
So I think this one actually looks feel very nice.	O
Some of them are a little bit weird, but.	O
They they do work.	O
I would love to put some pop music because that hides a lot, but the thing with pop music is that it's Super.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It's Super.	CHITCHAT
Kathy, so I would probably be single all day if we did the.	O
That kind of usage.	O
OK, I think let me check.	CHITCHAT
Let us check if there's any.	O
Yeah, there are some elements here below the clocks that haven't been that hard and have a shadow so so so so.	O
So we're going to replace some shadows in here.	O
We're applying some shadows here.	O
That's what we are doing right now.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you're listening to the music right now, but it's super spaces like.	O
Awesome AW, we have two apply also shadow to these Gray area.	O
Awesome.	CHITCHAT
Marshadow is here yay so much shadow.	O
OK, let me check in this.	O
I think this is the.	CHITCHAT
This area I think we do need to apply more shadow.	O
I think I'm going to use the paint bucket here.	O
Yeah, but there was too much I'm going to lower the opacity.	O
I'm going to apply the shadow here.	O
Great awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and I'm going to darken the purple we're using here too, so we give a more sense of perspective.	O
Awesome, so now you can see that this part is actually behind and not in front.	O
So we're going to apply more shadowing here.	O
Great.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
This is actually a psychology behind colors.	O
Usually purple is associated with royalty, but well, actually that's not very psychological, I think, but it still applies to something very artificial and in the many medieval times, the purple color.	O
Actually was a very expensive color to make.	O
To die, usually I think it was the the most expensive color to apply, so it was usually worn by royalty and the Catholic Church and that's why usually when you see purple you associated with royalty and Royal things and flamboyant Ann.	O

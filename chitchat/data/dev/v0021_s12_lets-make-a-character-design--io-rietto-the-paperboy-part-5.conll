That that's The Color Purple is very well if it's amazing.	O

The the agency where our paper boy is working is.	O
Kids, um?	CHITCHAT
It's a really upset.	O
Yeah, sorry I've got a little bit lost in my mind there.	O
OK, so let us check.	O
The shadows on the lighting I think.	O
I think we we could apply maybe more lighting in the purple part of this box, just a little bit of this and I'm going to blend it with the finger tool.	O
Just a little.	O
So it looks much more.	CHITCHAT
This, oh, I think I lost the shadowing here.	O
Come back.	CHITCHAT
OK, you came back also.	O
K so much more color in here.	O
As you can see I I didn't know but I don't know if you know guys that this was going to take a lot of time because it's much more details, but it's going to look amazing when we finish.	O
OK, so now a little bit of landing here and there.	O
Oh yeah, I think I'm going to apply just a bit in here.	O
So we can differ.	O
Deferring this so we can differentiate, differentiate yeah, OK, so now looks much more cool.	O
Can you see that the all the now it looks much more deep.	O
I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I am going to apply a little bit of land here in some shadow so they don't look so stiff, so tough.	O
Yeah, um.	CHITCHAT
Me and think I'm I think I'm going to apply a little bit more shuttle to these giant gear.	O
Maybe just a little to give the sense it has more depth in some in some of the lines.	O
Yeah, so it looks much more cooler.	O
Caleb Thomas in the order a sombra are equal.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
But affect the perfect.	O
OK, so I'm going to apply more shadow here at the.	O
In this Golden object that it's behind here.	O
OK, so let us see it from afar.	O
But wait, I think I'm going to apply here on the leather.	O
Some shadow, yeah from saddle so we have more deepness so it looks more.	O
Profound Yeah, so it looks much more cool.	O
OK, Let us check deriving Ono.	O
The workplace is still rotated.	O
I'm gonna put it back.	O
There we go.	O
I I forgot about that.	O
I was just painting my whole heart.	O
OK, so let's let's check how the the shading is looking.	O
OK, so we have it covered here in the newspapers.	O
The face is completely shaded.	O
That's good.	CHITCHAT
We have the air pumps on the cables.	O
There's a I just spotted a section where is.	O
It hasn't been shadowed yet.	O
I'm going to do it very quick so we can go.	O
To the mechanical part.	O

I think, yeah, I think we've covered no.	O
I think we have to apply a little bit more shadow here in.	O
OK, some more lighting here.	O
We don't want to regret it later.	O
I need to leave here a little bit there a little bit of sunshine.	O
Awesome, yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think this part is really let's go down below.	O
Yet their blouses perfectly fine.	O
Their letters are fine, we can apply maybe some more shadow here in the Golden sleep.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this part I think is it is looking very fine.	O
I think we can leave it there.	O
We don't want to over shadow because the main aspect of the live stream.	O
The idea is that if we focus on the character design itself and not much of in the painting.	O
So I think we can leave it here.	O
Yeah, so let's go down below.	O
OK, we can start.	CHITCHAT
Applying shadow to these.	O
Kind of dumb.	CHITCHAT
Kind of belt, but I think it's more an accessory the fans brings on.	O
We're going to keep it very simple.	O
We're going to remember where applying our shadows in the right part, an.	O
We're leaving.	O
Then Light the lights in the left part.	O
Yes, that is correct.	O
You can see it's very simple.	O
Details we are playing here, but it is going to help a lot when we see the bigger picture.	O
Say we do have to apply some shadows also below the accessory belt.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Awesome, OK, we're going to apply some light.	O
Even this part we're going to just make simple circle San have some help here.	O
With our trusty blender.	O
OK, it was too much I think.	O
Do you think I?	CHITCHAT
I think it was too much so we're gonna fix it.	O
OK, there an we're going to save some of this shadowing.	O
He's here now, I'm gonna make it more.	O
I was using the mixer again, that's why I was some painting correctly, OK?	O
There we go.	O
Yeah, I think it looks fine.	O
I'm going to play some simple shadows below the area below the blouse just to make a more shadowy effects.	O
And we can leave it there because we wanted to keep it simple so.	O
Yeah, actually I think now that I see it from afar, I think it was too much lighting.	O
We're going to fix that.	O
Well, I want to.	O
He was too bright and we're gonna dark native is here.	O
Cool OK.	CHITCHAT
So I think we can go on with it, uh, issues?	O

Let's go with the shoes.	O
OK, as you can see the difference between.	O
The The The shoe without shadows and having shadows is going to be very cool.	O
OK So what we do it?	CHITCHAT
Just apply some strokes.	O
Just impulse trucks that you can see in this.	O
Very simple, just we just go wild with pencils and then we use the blend and as you can see it's very simple.	O
It's very fun.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Is very subtle, so maybe if you want to really have a contrast you probably will need to apply it more times, and that's what I'm going to do right now, so I'm going to do it.	O
I think on time so we can actually have more darkening here.	O
Right, yeah, now I'm actually seeing the contrast off of the shadows in their shoot.	O
Awesome, awesome.	CHITCHAT
OK so I'm gonna.	CHITCHAT
Feel the holes here we have with a lighter color.	O

OK, as you can see now the shoe actually looks much more deep and it was Super Simple.	O
That's the Magic of blending.	O
OK, so now we're playing some a little bit of a light in the last part of the truth, so it has more deepness that so we make just some simple strokes and blend well.	O
As you are seeing, I'm actually using the same brush for the for both the brush tool and they blend tool.	O
That's that's why why is looks so natural?	O
When I when I blame, because when you use, uh?	O
Their regular blend brush, I mean, the typical Spherical won the gradient want it doesn't apply the texture of of the brush your actually painting, so you want to make sure you use table.	O
So look the show looks amazing.	O
Yeah OK so we are going to.	CHITCHAT
I think we're going to follow on with their with their right to yeah.	O
OK, so I don't know if you can see it on the screen guys, but see the difference between the left shoe and their right to Hello.	O

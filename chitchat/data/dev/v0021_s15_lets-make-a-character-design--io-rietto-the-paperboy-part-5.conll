Hopefully we can do them all today.	O
If not, we're going to continue next week.	O
We still have a lot of time left, so maybe we are lucky today.	O
OK, so now I'm going to fill the holes here.	O
So he looks very nice.	O
And we're going to apply here the shadows.	O
So how?	CHITCHAT
How's the weather guys see where you're living?	CHITCHAT
I'm actually from Chile so.	CHITCHAT
I mean, Santiago, Chile, that the capital.	CHITCHAT
Of this country and today is cloudy.	CHITCHAT
Just like my name cloud, it's very cloudy.	CHITCHAT
And it I'm actually amazed, because there's actually is not very cold.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, here we have.	CHITCHAT
We have a visitor solo.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I think it's going to.	CHITCHAT
It's a cat.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to show you guys, but I think the cat is is is going through the window so OK so I'm not gonna bother her but if she comes back I'm gonna totally get her so I can show you guys.	CHITCHAT
The beautiful cat.	CHITCHAT
No issues are are perfect, I think we don't have to shut on them anymore.	O
I think we can start with the bike.	O
I mean you see where we're going so fast today and so happy because we actually have a lot of current active issues.	O
So if you're watching this fluently, I'm amazed.	O
OK, so yes, we're going to start with the bike, but where, where, where should we start I think we can start with the with the.	O
By career rack part.	O
Yet I'm going to start with that.	O
Let's go.	CHITCHAT
I do love this.	O
This rear rack design how it turned it out because it just looked at it.	O
Does match the backpack designs and it also looks very very simple and the design we made here for their logo.	O
It looks very much like likeliness Ella.	O
So it's very cool.	CHITCHAT
Very, very close.	CHITCHAT
Um, let's start showing.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're going to dark in here.	O
As you can see, I'm applying some very simple strokes.	O
And now I'm going to.	O
To blend blend alot.	O
Blend, blend, blend just as simple as that.	O
If you guys want to make occurred to design just like this, you just need to blend.	O
Blend is the key for everything.	O
Again no actually I I when I do some character designs but some personal characteristics.	O
I do apply much more detailed so the design spots we don't want to make this one because.	O
It's important to always.	O
Focus on.	O
On the purpose of.	O
Off of what I mean the.	O
You you always have to ask yourself a.	O
On how you're going to apply the signed, you're actually making.	O
So since this design is going to be in a graphic novel, We do want to.	O
To give it simple, because the objectives of this design is to be to be replicated to be to be drawn a lot of time in the comic.	O
OK, so it's looking very nice.	O

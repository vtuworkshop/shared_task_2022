Gonna play more shadow.	O
Awesome, OK, I think this section has all the shadows we need.	O
Let us take from afar how it looks like in contrast with the other elements we've already shadow.	O
I'm going to still meet a little bit.	O
Yeah, I think it's it.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't look very nice, so let's apply the some lighting so we can go on with another section of their bike.	O
Say so we graph throat here and there very quick, very fast, so we don't waste time, time and Money.	O
Money is time and time is money.	CHITCHAT
I didn't see very quick, very fast.	O
We are playing some shadows with as some lighting.	O
Yes yes yes.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Did did did, did did did did with his friends.	CHITCHAT
Looking very nice guy.	O
Did did did, did did OK.	CHITCHAT
I think we can apply maybe some lighting here so it looks much more cooler.	O
We could also apply.	O
Yes, something like she.	O
I think you look nice.	O
This yellow brightness in the in the Clock.	O
I think we can apply to in the Clock that is on the backpack, so let's go here up, up here and do it for the Clock here.	O
Look how amazing it looks with a little bit of brightness.	O
He helps a lot.	O
He looks so much cooler than metallic field in here.	O
I think we can apply to all the metallic parts in here, so they look much more cooler.	O
Here and here and here.	O
Yeah, I think this looks so much nicer.	O
Made incredible value.	O
OK, let's go down, down, down.	O
OK, we're going to blend very fast so we don't lose time so we don't lose time and space.	O
OK, if you are like me, do you love animation an and once we are a good series, I thoroughly recommend a keeper and there, oh, I don't know how it's called in English, but an I think it's called the era of the big animals or something like that.	O
But it's actually well, the background design.	O
It's very good.	O
And the characters are very well written so.	O
I thoroughly recommend.	O
We're playing some like hearing the cables very quickly.	O
I don't think we need to blame them because they are very thing.	O
So I think we just by making some scrubs, we're going to have the aggressive fish.	O
OK, so these Golden part, we're going to change the color and.	O
Create so much more mechanically.	O
You can see some little throws can help allowed to bring an illustration to a higher level.	O
He looks so much cooler right now guys and super happy about it.	O
Oh, I think we forgot a little bit about some.	O

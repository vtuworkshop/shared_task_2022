Shadow and lighting here in the these gloves so I'm just correcting is very quick.	O
Which as soon.	O
OK, I let me see if I'm forgetting something.	O
I think yes.	CHITCHAT
I am forgetting the the letter part.	O
We're going to blend them very fast so it also gives a natural vibe.	O
A natural field.	O
OK, and we're going to.	O
Apply more purple in here.	O
Oh my God, it was too.	CHITCHAT
It was too bright.	O
We have to go back.	O
It's like just is like the back in the future movie.	O
We have to go back Marty back.	O
We're back to the bus.	O
I think I think she.	O
She said that maybe I, I don't remember it correctly.	O
I think I'm gonna watch it again.	O
It's just a very good summer movies.	O
I mean I don't know if if it once in the summer, but it's a really cool movie.	O
OK, we're building in very fast very soon, just to give more depth to the design.	O
Very, very quick.	CHITCHAT
We don't want to over shadow over lighting, so we're keeping it simple.	O
Keep it simple, guys.	O
That's our motto.	O
Keeping it simple.	O
Very, very simple.	O
OK, I think.	CHITCHAT
I think this part is.	O
I forgot that the cables in here and we're going to make some lights lighting strokes very quick.	O
Very very quick without blending.	O
It's going to look amazing.	O
OK, we can.	CHITCHAT
Yes we can follow up with this rocket.	O
Without playing with shadows.	O
Below the bike will.	O
Since.	CHITCHAT
Seems probably because of the of the bike rear rack and a bike will be found one receive as much light.	O
In contrast to other parts.	O
Of some.	O
So I see we blend very, very quick.	O
We are not looking for perfection in here.	O
We just want to see their growing complete.	O
Cortana.	O
OK, awesome OK.	CHITCHAT
I think we got go on with these horn horn system.	O
I'm going to call it horn system because I don't want to say another word but I think it's some horn instrument sister that looks very very cool.	O
Very steampunk so we're going to follow up with that.	O
OK, we're going to.	O
I thought the way so we're gonna play some throws very quick.	O
Very fast here under we're not thinking we're just doing, yay.	O
OK, OK, well then I need a little bit more dark in here.	O
Let's apply the throat clear very quick, very fast, very quick, very fast.	O
That is our model here.	O
Can you probably only seen my head right now is probably going a little.	O
So funny.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
They will have.	O
We are applying some shadows.	O

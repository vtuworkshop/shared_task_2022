I'm going to think about it.	O
Well, in Spanish is called Illuminazione, That's what we are doing.	O
If Thomas Illumi, Nando?	O
Some nasty out of someones illumi number.	O
We are applying their light.	O
We are thinking about is the light comes from the left side.	O
The shadow is going to be on the right.	O
You really wondering why I mention it this so much, but I actually seen.	O
This is from my personal experience.	O
I actually seem a lot of creative people, a lot of artists that.	O
And apply shadows.	O
I'll lighting in in every.	O
I mean they they don't think about the word.	O
The light comes from in a drawing, so they applied very randomly.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
That does give the effect that the drawing never has a real perspective.	O
So if you want your design to actually have.	O
This sensation that the.	O
The objects are have some, some business, some roundness in it.	O
You need to apply correctly the lighting.	O
OK, I think we are.	CHITCHAT
We are almost I'm going to play just some lighting here, so it looks much more cool.	O
And a little bit of shadow here in the will.	O

Yeah let's follow up with the wheel.	O
I'm going to start with the This is called.	O
Now this is the bike frame.	O
OK, we're not going to do that.	O
We're going to do the raincoat.	O
I know it's not cold, they rankled, but it's big rain cover.	O
It's the bike drain cover.	O
As before, we just make some simple shadow strokes here and there.	O
Remember seeing there's a bag?	O
Being on top of the of the rain cover, we have to consider that a shadow comes from their here to very quick shadows.	O
Some simple through we ever committed.	O
Simple and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we're going to blend it.	O
I forgot to apply here comes strokes below the the coin.	O
I know there there and coins by they looked like like coins.	O
There are more like.	O
And buttons, metallic buttons.	O
There probably like nails.	O

OK, and now we blame very smoothly to have these beautiful sensational.	O
Oh, having some.	O
Grave in effect.	O
They remembered to fill the homes.	O
Here so it doesn't look weird that there's.	O
Some light in the.	O
Department here.	O
OK, remember fill the holes.	O
Never forgive the whole so it looks much more cooler.	O
Here, feel like holes filled in the holes heal in the forest fire in the phone.	O
Here in the house also showers may holes.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, we have to apply also some shadow here in the interior parts of the of a bike cover I'm going to darken it a bit more.	O
Great, I mean amazing OK?	CHITCHAT
I think we're almost done with the shadow of this rain cover.	O
Yeah, let's apply some lighting.	O
I'm going to play just a little bit because the rank over it's very thing, so we don't want to over like this.	O

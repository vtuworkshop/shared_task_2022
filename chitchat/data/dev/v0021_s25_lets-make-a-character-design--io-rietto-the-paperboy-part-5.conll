Play some simple stroke here on their very simple.	O
Keep it simple.	O
Great.	CHITCHAT
Sing OK, if you want to learn more about lighting.	O
Is super important to have references from?	O
From real life objects so.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Make an exercise of having an object in.	O
I don't know, for example, a water bottle or maybe a pencil or a box even.	O
Can put it on a table and then and then grab a.	O
Gravel light.	O
A laid.	O
A lamp alight lamp table yeah, a light lamp table.	O
And move it around and see how the how they lighting and shadows change.	O
In the object you're using, when you use when you.	O
When you change the light, so that's actually a very good exercise.	O
I can totally recommend if you want to be better at at lighting.	O
Because usually like it.	O
Always changes it always in different elements.	O
They they have servitor reflected very differently is actually a very, very sexy's part.	O
So yeah, OK we have it in here.	O
We're gonna shadow there.	O
They bike frame.	O
Yes, we're going to show the bike frames.	O
Give Me 2 seconds.	CHITCHAT
I need to take a little bit of water.	CHITCHAT
I am talking too much.	CHITCHAT
What?	CHITCHAT
I took a lot today, so OK, let's follow up with the bike frame.	O
We're going to swing it so you guys can look looking very.	O
From from close enough.	O
As you can see, when we when we make soon, we can actually see that we have to cover some parts and darken it out.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I think we can actually leave it just like this.	O
We don't have to blend it.	O
I think it's going to look much more cold in this part.	O
This go down below woo.	O
OK, I'm gonna jerk.	O
Need a little bit more.	O
I remember here son August, so we have to apply some shallow.	O
Below is here to remember.	O
Always apply the shallow below is there shadow is going from the left.	O
He said this is gonna give.	O
Much more depth to our bike lanes.	O
Conversely.	O
That's all around.	O
And around again it reminds me.	O
Too bad florius log is like from the 2000s.	O
That test you see my head right round baby right round at at at at at at at I sorry I know guys I I think too bad so.	O
If I could sync good, this would be any crazy.	O
Will write life straightened out.	O
OK, so let's keep on applying shadow here.	O
It's gonna look very very very very cool.	O
The air remember always the shadow below since we are receiving the light from OK.	O
Remember the light is from there.	O
The shadow come from there.	O
OKOK can you see that here we forgot that part.	O

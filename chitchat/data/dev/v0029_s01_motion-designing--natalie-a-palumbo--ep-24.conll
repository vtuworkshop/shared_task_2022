But before I do I just got my first comment.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go ahead and address that it's from Chris Perry who's returned from other broadcasts.	CHITCHAT
Hello from Auckland, New Zealand.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you again.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for tuning in and uh, that said, I'm going to go ahead and jump in after effects.	CHITCHAT
By the way, this program is my goto.	CHITCHAT
I use it every day.	CHITCHAT
You can do so much with after effects and if you have Premier you can seamlessly time audio with really intricate effects and compositing elements.	O
It's just fantastic, especially with the dynamic link.	O
I use it all the time, it's great so this is the one I worked on the last time.	O
If you weren't here for episode 23.	O
That backdrop back there, this was originally almost as bright as Anthony here.	O
Say hello to Anthony and, uh, I thought it would be nice to emphasize him a bit more.	O
In that scene.	O
There's other clips with that white wall and I wanna try compositing that out.	O
Well, compositing it.	O
So it's darker innocence, so there's more emphasis on the musician, so I'm going to take a look at what clips correspond with what numbers so I can properly.	O
Find it in after effects.	O
There's so many comps that were developed from Premier going into after effects that I have to backtrack now.	O
At this point there's over 30 of them.	O
It.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
There was one earlier of it was another clip of Anthony.	O
That's one 'cause that white wall really.	O
It conflicts with Brian and Anthony and I've worked on this one previously too.	O
So I might do a couple of pickups this time.	O
Oh, there's another repeat.	O
You are here, uhm?	O
I know that there is a specific way to pronounce his name.	O
Baja Dirk Hun right.	O
Hello how are you?	CHITCHAT
Your talent is amazing.	CHITCHAT
Thank you and thank you so much for tuning back in.	CHITCHAT
It's good to see you um if I am.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if I pronounce your name correctly.	CHITCHAT
I know that there was a very specific pronunciation and I know you mentioned it in a prior broadcast, so just let me know if, uh, if I mispronounced it in any way.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and start with this one here.	O
Let me find out what number it is.	O
#3 OK, so this one is probably going to be quick 'cause I already composite it out the musicians, so this is just a matter of making a mass for the white wall in a sense, so this should be an easy fix.	O
I kept looking at those particular clips and thinking how can I push those further?	O
'cause they look nice, but they could.	O
You pronounce correct.	CHITCHAT
Oh thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I didn't want to come.	CHITCHAT
I was afraid that, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I was afraid that I had forgotten the pronunciation and I just wanted to get it right out of out of respect for your, uh, enthusiasm for watching my process.	CHITCHAT
So thank you for letting me know.	CHITCHAT
And that goes for anybody that is in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Or you know, if you ask a question, let me know if I'm if I'm pronouncing your name correctly.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is the same.	O
This should be easy to handle.	O
Let me take a look.	O
Let's see Alpha channels here.	O
Uh, let's see what?	CHITCHAT
So it looks like this one is going to be a little more specific, 'cause I think the only thing that's maxed out here is the drums.	O
So question is, do I go ahead and mask out?	O
Or Now I suppose I could do loose masks and then.	O
Why not?	O
Show up a little bit of the masking process.	O
Why not?	O
Could be fun, could be fun.	O
Normally I do this ahead of time because it can get time consuming consuming, but in this case I have a simplified process that I can try for this.	O

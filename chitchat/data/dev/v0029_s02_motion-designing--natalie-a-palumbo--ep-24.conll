OK, let's see.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to call this.	O
Just labeling it so I know what it is.	O
Background mask Alright, so.	O
I'm just going to loosely.	O
Go around Anthony here.	O
Just almost a simplified shape.	O
I'm turning them into silhouette cut outs.	O
Now all we need really is just that one side 'cause we were going to in.	O
We're going to intersect with the actual lighter part of the wall.	O
Now I don't know how this is going to work, but it might involve more mass than one, so we'll see we'll see what happens.	O
Oh, that's right.	CHITCHAT
Gotta attach it to the motion track null.	O
If I can find it.	O
There's so many layers here.	O
Uh, OK drum no answer.	O
There it is.	O
That's the motion tracking all.	O
Just use that one.	O
There's a couple that are in scene because.	O
I want to make sure to keep the.	O
Composition as non destructive as possible so I will duplicate certain layers too.	O
I'll duplicate certain layers to pre compose into layers within the composition so it maintains its movement, but you still have the original to rely on in case you need another one.	O
Alright, so I'm going to attach it to that.	O
I'm just going to go every 5 frames and see what I can change here.	O
Again, we're kind of keeping it loosey goosey here, we're just using it as an edge.	O
Under the circumstances, normally you would mask out everybody, but this was one of the earlier ones where I wanted to mask out just the instruments.	O
At least the ones that were being emphasized at certain points in the song so.	O
You know it got more elaborate as I continued working on it.	O
An happens.	O
But that's where you go back and you make it stronger.	O
It's also going to be feathered so we don't have to be.	O
Exactly precise with where it lands.	O
You know, it just needs to follow the outline, so to speak.	O
Looks like it slides with the.	O
Oh wait a minute.	CHITCHAT
No, it's going to set it to quarters so it'll go a little faster.	O
All I can't really see it.	O
It's a It's all pixelated at quarter res.	O
No big deal, though.	O
I'd rather wait and, uh, no.	O
It's landing at the right points.	O
So I'm pretty sure I worked on this one a couple times.	O
But when I made that one revision.	O
To the other clip it just it.	O
It could change the approach for the other ones.	O
Looks like he is.	O
He kind of leans into the curtain area, which.	O

Essentially in this case, is a safe zone in terms of masking.	O
'cause it's not intersecting with the white wool.	O
So this process is actually going a little bit easier than I thought.	O
You're given this is involving, uhm?	O
Anthony, who's drumming incredibly fast at this point during the song.	O
And they do a fantastic cover of Hallelujah.	CHITCHAT
I love her so it's, uh.	CHITCHAT
I've always loved that song ever since I heard the.	CHITCHAT
The real the real recording on Beatles Anthology.	CHITCHAT
Uhm The Beatles cover when they were teenagers I just fell in love with it.	CHITCHAT
It was wrong, but you could tell they were pitch perfect the whole time.	CHITCHAT
It was just fantastic.	CHITCHAT
And they do a justice.	CHITCHAT
I just noticed you left a couple of years to like a <3 Bahadur.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to go as fast as I can, 'cause I want to.	O
This is more technical in terms of.	O
You know visual effects and motion graphics compositing.	O
I want to show more of the creative ND compositing and color treatments and animation parts of the process to you guys.	O
So I am going to.	O
Move as quickly as possible so we can continue forward with that part of it.	O
Back All right?	O
That looks good.	O
OK, so I see one movement that I'm going to have to add a mask for.	O
'cause there's a gap.	O
Right here, where his arm is, I can easily Adam ask for that.	O
I can go back and do that.	O
But It's always better to do loose masks, but then add more of them.	O
You save a lot more time having more masks.	O
And capturing more of the.	O
Of the object that you're trying to mask out or mask in, but.	O
If you go really detailed with them asking it could take a lot longer for you to, uh, finalise the animation process for masking so.	O
If you were wondering about the process, if you were going to try doing it, I would.	O
I would I would take a loose approach and, uh.	O
And if you have to go more complex, make more, make more smaller masks for those complex motions.	O
The end result will be the same, but it's about time consumption at that point.	O
Kay?	CHITCHAT
I'll tell you what though I do enjoy this process.	O
Uh, quite a bit.	O
There's so much you can do with Track Matting, Uhm?	O
Like you can really define how to composite certain elements in the scene and.	O
I don't want to make a new mouse yet.	O
But you can really, uh?	O
Like, let's say you're a masking out a person in a scene you can.	O
Color correct, just that person and the rest of the scene will stay the same, and, uh, that opens up a lot of possibilities, especially if you're working with film.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
I kind of wonder how I can implement this kind of stuff all the time.	O
You know what I'm going to change the color of that mask, so it's a little easier to see on screen all.	O

Let's make it.	O
Just make it lemon yellow.	O
Yeah, that's easier to see.	O
Oh, uh, there's a comment.	CHITCHAT

Are you able to group selects your math notes and move them as a group of EG just for the head or shoulder etc.	O
You can do that.	O
Um, in this case I.	O
Because they are moving within scene.	O
First of all, it's actually parented to a motion track, so it's following the motion track.	O
As I'm moving down the line in the South sequence.	O
But beyond that, because it's moving with the motion track I I manually move the key frames.	O
Well, actually the points in the mask.	O
Excuse me, I have to use the right terminology.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I prefer to take that approach because you know where it's going to land and that is going to be accurate.	O
You know it's a little.	CHITCHAT
It takes a little longer, but it's more accurate.	O
I find, but you can do that essentially like I can show you an example.	O
Right now I'm not going to move them, but let's say you do this.	O
He just.	CHITCHAT
Hold down, click and just drag.	O
You can select all those nodes and move it once.	O
So yes, you can do that.	O
Um, I'm not going to for the purpose of this because I already have emotion tracks, but I hope that answers your question.	O
I'm going to take a quick sip of water while I'm at it.	CHITCHAT
Stay hydrated out there, you guys.	CHITCHAT
Chris Perry writes.	CHITCHAT
OK, great thanks.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad that, uh, I'm glad I was able to answer your question.	O
It's a thoughtful question, and, uh, if you don't know the process.	O
If you new to it, of you know.	O
You know if anybody is new to the process, I think they would want to know too.	O
How does it work?	O
What you're supposed to do?	O
So questions are always good.	O
K.	CHITCHAT
Sounds pretty close.	O
It's going to move that down.	O
Those in.	O
Selected both at the same time.	O
Now for this one.	O
OK, that is accurately following it, so I guess what I would have to do is move these in.	O
So in that case I can actually show that process you were asking about.	O
And then just move a couple in.	O
It's a good thing I added that keyframe 'cause his arm moves up.	O

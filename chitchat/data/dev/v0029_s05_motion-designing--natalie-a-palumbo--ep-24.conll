Good thing it's actually it's actually following his arm, thankfully.	O
Let me just make sure that his leg is also doing the same thing.	O
Looks like that's accurate too.	O
The tricky one is going to be an arm, it looks like.	O
But we got most of the groundwork done.	O
This is just.	O
More accurately covering.	O
The movement.	O
At this point.	O
Alright, let me check that once it looks like.	O
OK, that's good.	O
That's all of the movement.	O
There's a term in animation.	O
I'm essentially in a manner of Speaking of essentially adding um inbetweens between the keyframes.	O
To flush out the movement.	O
So some of the key frames if they go behind the drums, that's.	O
That's OK because that's messed out.	O
That's not going to be affected by the back wall.	O
Just making sure that whatever does show up if it's in musicians that.	O
They are essentially.	O
The outline follows them.	O
Right, So what happens here?	O
OK, so it's sort of following that.	O
I'm just going to refine here.	O
Kay?	CHITCHAT
But what happened here?	O
There is a movement, I saw it.	O
Maybe that down.	O
Ha there is.	CHITCHAT
Gotcha.	CHITCHAT
Snook outside the lines.	O
Now I know some of the later ones already have the musicians mast out, so more than likely those ones are going to be a lot simpler than this.	O
This just happens to be one of the earlier ones that has, uh.	O
Less track matting on it.	O
OK, so I've got to move those down.	O
You know the question you asked actually was really good suggestion.	O
'cause I'm using it now, so thank you Chris.	O
For asking about a moving points is a groove.	O
It does a.	CHITCHAT
It does streamline the process of it.	O
All right, so here we go.	O
OK, just left the thumbs up.	O
Yeah no I'm I'm really glad you asked about that.	O
Now we're almost done, so I can probably move on to Brian now.	O
He's probably going to have.	O
He's probably going to be a bit more complex, but I'm going to try to keep it as loose as possible so we can just mask him out of the backdrop.	O
Oh Anthony Carbajal, who has been in previous livestreams Greetings, Natalie.	O

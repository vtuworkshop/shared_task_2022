Hi it's good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for tuning in.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's just make sure that it's following his movement.	O
What's going on here?	CHITCHAT
Checking his elbow, that's sort of the.	O
I wouldn't call it a problem area, but there's a lot of movement there, so we want to make sure to capture said movement.	O
OK, what's going on with his shoulder?	O
It's a little inward, so I'm just going to move him up a little bit.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, What's going on here?	O
Yep, there we go a little bit out of bounds here and see the.	O
Backdrop in his arm.	O
In the.	CHITCHAT
In the trackpad outline at least.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
I'm just checking my work making sure that.	O
It doesn't shift and it only captures him there we go, that's one.	O
Well, I'm at it, so I should probably go back and make sure that all of these things are.	O
Completely track manage so I can really bring down the.	O
Brightness of that wall.	O
Anthony, you change the game.	O
You and your drumming.	O
No, honestly, I'm glad I found out about it.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Up what's going on here?	O
Wait for it.	CHITCHAT
OK, uhm, let's see OK.	CHITCHAT
What did I just move?	O
I swear I'm trying to click on the math.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There should be squares in order for you to.	O
Play with the.	O
The points.	O
Uh, so?	CHITCHAT
Anthony Carbajal, rights.	O
Natalie, just curious, do the nodes in after effects have anchor points like illustrator or Photoshop?	O
Oh, you mean like gum like splines?	O
Yeah, you can do that.	O
You can do them that way.	O
I just preferred to keep them linear.	O
It's a lot easier to handle when you're doing track matting.	O
At least that's what I prefer.	O
Some people prefer them to be flyings aurum.	O
You know I'm working with linear right now, but there are people that prefer to work with lines in masks.	O
So, uh, yeah, you can do that.	O
I'll show you.	O
And then I'm going to undo it.	O
So for instance, you can take this one.	O
And you've got a flying going, we pray.	O
Fairly fairly Stein OK.	O
But I hope that answers your question.	O
It works the same way.	O
Sometimes I accidentally turn linear points into splines and I just keep going.	O
Just wanna make sure this one follows.	O
I think it does.	O
Appears like it does.	O
Oh wait a minute.	O
Didn't mean to do that.	O
He said.	CHITCHAT
Oh Anthony followed up and said Nicely demonstrated and fun.	O
Thank you.	O
I thought it would be good to show a visual example of that.	O
You know it's a lot easier to understand if you can see it.	O

I find like visual visual directives and tutorials are always more helpful.	O
I find then just giving somebody a list you know, go here, then go here.	O
But if you don't know where things are placed within the program if you're not familiar, that may be a lot harder for you.	O
Some people like it, but I much prefer the visual format.	O
But you will accommodate the learning style.	O
You always do.	O
Alright OK, that looks good.	O
These are a little out of bounds.	O
I'm just going to bring them in.	O
Slightly cayanne then bring that OK good good that looks good.	O
The funny thing is I thought he was going to be more difficult to mask.	O
'cause he's just moving at a rapid pace.	O
It it it it it?	CHITCHAT
Fast drumming.	O
Pizza, he fantastic.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if, uh, if the people watching were here for episode 23, but I premiered because it was Ringo's 80th birthday on Tuesday.	CHITCHAT
I showed the tribute video that we put together for Abbey Road on the River for Ringo's birthday and that was a lot of fun.	CHITCHAT
And, uh, it was the first one they showed in a series of tribute videos which I was so excited to find that out.	CHITCHAT
But if you want to take a look at it, it's on their Facebook page.	CHITCHAT
I would highly recommend taking a look at their covers and.	CHITCHAT
Any of the live streams that we've done.	CHITCHAT
They are fantastic musicians and.	CHITCHAT
I would definitely take a look if you're interested in classic rock and and their originals are just as phenomenal.	CHITCHAT
As the covers they do so.	CHITCHAT
Anthony followed up and said, Oh yes, definitely visuals are so much more effective.	CHITCHAT
I guess that's why I always love the pretty pictures.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely, if that's the way you learn, and that's what you're drawn to, you're going to be able to understand that a lot more.	CHITCHAT
And I'm, you know, I'm the same way my brother was also a visual learner.	CHITCHAT
He figured out.	CHITCHAT
He's he loves technology and there are things that he figured out that we couldn't explain to him.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how he knew, but he was able to without us telling him.	CHITCHAT
And this was back when he when we were kids.	CHITCHAT
He set up a projector to his laptop so he could play games and watch it on the protector.	CHITCHAT
This is like in a classroom and so I mean it wasn't disrupting anything.	CHITCHAT
This is like after hours and uh.	CHITCHAT
But we couldn't tell him how to do it.	CHITCHAT
He knew innately, an it was just.	CHITCHAT
It was fascinating.	CHITCHAT
But it's like he visually knew how to set it up.	CHITCHAT
That's the best way I can describe it.	CHITCHAT
Oh Anthony Rice.	CHITCHAT
Wow, I can't believe Ringo his 80 peace and Love Peace and Love Peace and love.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the vast was a fantastic I, uh.	CHITCHAT
I was live streaming that night so I saw a little bit and then I had to jump into sewing my creative process, but it was wonderful.	CHITCHAT
The people that were tuning in and it was just joyous the whole thing and that that video was a lot of fun to put together.	CHITCHAT
You know the whole day we were filming, and, uh, when I was actually doing post production on it and I added a little graphic.	CHITCHAT
If you go look on their wall or an episode 23, you'll see it.	CHITCHAT
I made the yellow submarine of birthday candle an it's floating across the screen.	CHITCHAT
So I I think that this mask is.	O
This mask looks pretty good to go.	O
I can probably move on to Brian, Which.	O
Looking at him, I'm gonna probably need to do.	O
A couple I'm gonna send you a couple more mass for him in particular.	O
Although maybe I should go ahead and intersect the mask for the white wall perhaps?	O
Oh, that's right, that's right.	O
I almost forgot.	O
There's one more mass for Anthony.	O
I have to do.	O
This is going to be easy.	O
Oh, this is this is a piece of Cake Alright?	O

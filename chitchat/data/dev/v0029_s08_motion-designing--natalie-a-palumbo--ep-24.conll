So.	CHITCHAT
This needs to be maxed out to.	O
This is a small small thing.	O
It's a small mask after all.	O
Oh, Gabriel Rodriguez, who was also who's also here from a prior broadcast rights high lady.	CHITCHAT
Hawaii, thank you for tuning in.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so this one should be.	O
Easy to mask out.	O
Now I do what I do have some new clips prepared.	O
But I want to make sure that every clip is as strong as it can be before I move on to any of the new ones.	O
And that's why you have to go back and review and.	O
You know if it can be stronger, make it stronger.	O
You know you, uh?	CHITCHAT
You step back from one of your projects and then after a while you come back and you realize that.	O
That there's something missing and you need to revise it, and that's OK.	O
It shows growth.	O
Growth is A is a welcomed thing.	O
That's the only way that you get stronger, as if you realize you can do better.	O
Alright, that's one.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if there's any other gaps here.	O
I think that's the only one, although let me just make sure.	O
Oh wait, there's one more.	O
So he's got a total of three masks.	O
I do like seeing the animation up close that was greatly revised from the last time I worked on it and.	O
It looks so much stronger afterwards.	O
Initially it was, uhm, it was bright on top of an already bright drum set.	O
Which, uh In a way almost diminished the detail.	O
So rather than leave it the way it is, uhm.	O
I wanted to create a sense of emphasis.	O
On the drums.	O
Where there's an impact and then when you see the impact there is.	O
A color change and a brightness change and a textural change.	O
Activate it.	O
As I say.	O
Alright, I think let me just.	O
OK, one more hang on.	O
One more.	CHITCHAT
There's one little one there.	O
OK, that is.	O
That's it for the starting, and then the endpoint dragon.	O
We just make sure it's all the way down and not OK, perfect.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Great alright so.	CHITCHAT
That's going to be set to subtract.	O
Sometimes if you arrange the if you are Angel.	O

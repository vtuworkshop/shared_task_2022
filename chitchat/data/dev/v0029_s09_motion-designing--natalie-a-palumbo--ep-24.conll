If you arrange the layers in a certain way.	O
You'll be able to.	O
Eliminate a lot of problems with masking.	O
So I just want to make sure they show up correctly.	O
OK, that's definitely showing up correctly.	O
'cause we don't want to mouse him out.	O
I am going to.	O
Turn that of-.	O
I'm going to subtract the curtain over here 'cause we're not darkening that.	O
Will be a little easier to understand what we are making in terms of a track.	O
Matt and I think that was not on that.	O
OK, good, now we're on the right layer.	O
So Anthony Rights, is it necessary to delete the noted Matthew, drag off the active frame?	O
I do that so there's a start and stop point for where they appear.	O
And when they are dragged off the composition, that's when they are not visible, otherwise, if.	O
If there left there, it's going to interfere with the visibility of the effects.	O
So essentially we're using them just for certain parts and then.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
There's a hard way to explain it because, but that's sort of the process that I use in a manner of speaking.	O
I'm sure there's other processes, but dumb.	O
This is the method that I choose to do in this case because it's only going to be on for a couple of frames and then it's not going to be there 'cause it's only masking out small shapes that are on for maybe 5 frames.	O
And then they're gone.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I hope that answers your question.	O
It's a good question, though I'm sure there's other methods, but.	O
Visually, I like this one because I can really get in there and, uh, sort of draw.	O
Around the shapes that I want to either mask in or mask out.	O
Kind of a manual rotoscope, but with Max instead of sketching it like the take on me a music video.	O
Now, if it follows the motion track, it probably up.	O
Wait a minute.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit over there.	O
It wasn't wide enough.	O
Got it and get that one up there.	O
Looks like it's following the motion tracks so that one was pretty easy to implement.	O
And we're going to gather that too, so it's it can be a little looser in this case.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Good that was done.	O
The tricky one is going to be Brian.	O
Oh Anthony right.	O
Yes I get it.	O
I tend to do the same thing.	O
OK good, I'm glad that, uh, my explanation made sense to you.	O
Um, what you asked is really thoughtful and I had to think about it for a second because I.	O
That's the method that I use, and I'm sure other people do that too, just to.	O
You know, ease the process of keyframing, especially if it's involving some footage and compositing only certain details, but yeah.	O
For him, I think I'm going to break it down into shapes.	O
Just to simplify the process a lot further.	O
Everyone say hello to Brian.	CHITCHAT
While I'm at it, I might solo out the footage so I can really see.	O

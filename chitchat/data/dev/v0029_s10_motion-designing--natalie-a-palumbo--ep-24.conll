Yeah, that works too.	O
That looks great.	CHITCHAT
He's a little trickier because he tends to bounce around a bit.	O
At least in this scene.	O
And with the handheld footage movement, which is.	O
Which was me I was holding out, his hand holding the camera and moving around the room and getting footage of them.	O
Now you have to take that into account when you're adding masks on film footage, whether or not.	O
There's any movement within the footage itself.	O
Looks like there's a question here so Gabriel Rodriguez asked, So what tip would you give to anyone who wants to learn more about motion?	CHITCHAT
What to study?	CHITCHAT
That is a very good question.	CHITCHAT
The first thing I would do is start with.	CHITCHAT
I would look at a couple of resources.	CHITCHAT
One of the ones off the top of my head that you can look at is School of motion which is run by a former teacher in the motion design Department at Ringling College of Art and design is which is.	CHITCHAT
Where I got my training?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I would look at professionals in the industry based on what part of motion design you want to go into, 'cause it's actually branched out into different sectors.	CHITCHAT
There's add design there's.	CHITCHAT
There is motion graphic design.	CHITCHAT
There's broadcast designers, visual effects and compositing.	CHITCHAT
There are many facets of motion design that you can study, so depending on what you want your focus to be, I would start there.	CHITCHAT
Look at people that are in the industry that do what you want to do.	CHITCHAT
You know, listen to their interviews.	CHITCHAT
If they do tutorials, watch them.	CHITCHAT
I would look at LinkedIn learning which used to be Lynda.	CHITCHAT
Com, especially if you're going to learn about motion graphics and the software involved.	CHITCHAT
That is the best advice I can give and just take it all in taking everything that is.	CHITCHAT
Suggested all the advice and especially.	CHITCHAT
First and foremost.	CHITCHAT
You have to understand the animation principles first before anything else.	CHITCHAT
It's one thing if you know the programs, but it's quite another if you understand animation and how things move.	CHITCHAT
So I would definitely take those into account when you do research and have fun.	CHITCHAT
It's A wonderful.	CHITCHAT
It's wonderful field to be in and there's so much.	CHITCHAT
Uh, there's so many things that you can do.	CHITCHAT
Within that realm.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I hope that answers your question.	CHITCHAT
It's a really thoughtful run and best of luck to you.	CHITCHAT
It's a wonderful field.	CHITCHAT
I personally wanted to study a little bit of everything so I could be strong in all areas of the production process.	CHITCHAT
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
So I learned a little bit of everything and at the time that's what they were teaching us.	CHITCHAT
They taught us graphic design, typography, design, 2D3D, Animation, stop motion, understanding how animation works, an visual effects film compositing, a little bit of sound mixing In addition.	CHITCHAT
So we had a broad range of skills and then based on that.	CHITCHAT
We decided what direction we wanted to go in, and in my case I wanted to.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to be strong and everything.	CHITCHAT
So I can handle anything.	CHITCHAT
So Gabriel followed up and said yes, I get it.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
I'm so glad when I said, made sense and good luck to you.	CHITCHAT
Good luck to you.	CHITCHAT
Anthony follows up and says, well said it is crucial to understand the way things moved naturally in their environment, absolutely.	CHITCHAT
There are just there's a term in the animation principles called appeal in order for things to look visually pleasing, an correct it has to have appeal and it has to move in certain ways.	O

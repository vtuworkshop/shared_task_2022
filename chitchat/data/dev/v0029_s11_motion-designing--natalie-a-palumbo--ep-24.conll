It has to have weight and have a sense of anticipation.	O
Ann, you have to take those into account when you are designing and when you are applying motion to that design.	O
That's the crux of it.	O
And I always want to get stronger.	O
The only way that you can get better and you can grow as if you just take it all in and you stay enthusiastic and you stay inspired.	O
Now this.	O
It's kind of like pieces of a puzzle.	O
We just turned Brian into it into a jigsaw puzzle.	O
I'm going to take another sip of water.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Speaking of jigsaw puzzles, I guess it's a good time to mention my.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
My custom design top for the evening, so I'm actually wearing a, uh.	CHITCHAT
A little chiffon tops with Anthology one at on the overall design.	CHITCHAT
I made it so, uh.	CHITCHAT
I made it just as a custom thing so I could wear it to beatlefest for one of the days and I thought it would be nice to show it on the broadcast because of Ringo's birthday for one and just the legacy he.	CHITCHAT
He represents and high Jeremy, You're back again.	CHITCHAT
What are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Jeremy has interrupted at least three broadcast so far.	CHITCHAT
I'm keeping score.	CHITCHAT
For every wonder if anybody that's wondering what I'm talking about, my rescue cat, Jeremy likes to watch me work on projects, and, uh.	CHITCHAT
He especially likes to sit against the computer, especially while it's rendering because it's nice and warm and he has, um, sometimes mess with the webcam and ship during the broadcast, and he's just a little love bug.	CHITCHAT
But he's definitely a bad boy so.	CHITCHAT
And for anybody wondering 'cause this ties into thing goes birthday again, he's named for.	CHITCHAT
The character in the nowhere man sequence in yellow submarine.	CHITCHAT
And he's just like that character.	CHITCHAT
He's just got an exuberant personality.	CHITCHAT
Normally he interrupts because he's hungry, so.	CHITCHAT
OK, you know what this is going to need a separate mask here, so I am going to.	O
I'm going to do this.	O
I'm going to take out these points here.	O
So I have any right.	O
Oh no, Brian is going to pieces.	CHITCHAT
Brian never goes to pieces.	CHITCHAT
And then he followed up and said it always enjoy seeing your wardrobe creation.	CHITCHAT
So thank you.	CHITCHAT
I thought it would be nice too well so I love the designs of the Anthology albums.	O
The first one I designed was a was an off the shoulder dresses anthology 3 because it's the most colorful and I just love the designs of all three put together.	O
They're just gorgeous gorgeous album covers and this music video for free as a bird hands down is still one of my favourites to this day.	O
It's got everything.	O
That I'm inspired by Scott compositing.	O
It's got animation it's got.	O
It's got everything.	O
It just plays with your perception.	O
And when I was when I was younger I had no idea that it was all different film clips just mesh together.	O
I realize that later on, but it was just so seamless.	O
And so beautiful.	O

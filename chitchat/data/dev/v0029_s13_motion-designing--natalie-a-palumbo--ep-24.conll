'cause he loves cats and I said Anthony, what about Ringo?	CHITCHAT
We can leave him.	CHITCHAT
Ringo, he's the 4th cat to be adopted.	CHITCHAT
It was something like that anyway, and he goes no.	CHITCHAT
Only Jeremy like he insisted on the name so his name, his name became Jeremy.	CHITCHAT
So all we have a new viewer in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Hi Natalie, I'm I'm new here.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for sharing your work.	CHITCHAT
Any he sent a hard I emoji and to that I say.	CHITCHAT
Uh, then Django?	CHITCHAT
Um, thank you for tuning in.	CHITCHAT
And, uh, let me know if I'm pronouncing your name correctly.	CHITCHAT
Perhaps Jeremy is falling into the Sea of holes.	CHITCHAT
I maybe he did, maybe he did.	CHITCHAT
That's actually my favorite part of the whole film, especially if you see it on the big screen.	CHITCHAT
Hey, how are you?	CHITCHAT
Cancel.	CHITCHAT
I guess he doesn't want to be on camera right now.	CHITCHAT
I said no.	CHITCHAT
He chirped in approval.	CHITCHAT
He's not even on another one.	CHITCHAT
I think he's a little bit excited.	CHITCHAT
He's definitely a bad boy.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
I think I've got all the maths I need here, so now I can start really playing with them.	CHITCHAT
Funny story about the Sea of holes.	CHITCHAT
I'd always wanted to see that sequence on the big screen.	CHITCHAT
'cause I remember my mom telling me stories about watching that sequence at Beatlefest back in the day and they used to show that film like on a on a large screen in the auditorium and it just engulfs you and the whole thing is traditionally animated and it just.	CHITCHAT
It's gorgeous and it's just a.	CHITCHAT
It's a beautiful representation of one of the lines in a day in the life and it's just.	CHITCHAT
Beautifully depicted an captured and I'd always wanted to see it on the big screen and I got the opportunity to, um, we went out to go see it on her birthday and.	CHITCHAT
Right after.	CHITCHAT
That scene we both looked at each other.	CHITCHAT
Just like wow, like we were both just blown away by it.	CHITCHAT
If you have the chance to go see yellow submarine on the big screen, I would.	CHITCHAT
It's a wonderful, wonderful little.	CHITCHAT
It's a wonderful film just to to look at in terms of experimental animation.	CHITCHAT
And the music is just phenomenal.	CHITCHAT
Jeremy has a beautiful coat.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
He's very loved.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Since I made more math, this should be a much easier process than what we had to deal with with Anthony's masking so.	O
What's ironic is that it's following the motion track pretty closely, so it's just a matter of.	O
Defining the edges.	O
Let's let's see.	O
But once we do this then we could just dark in the backdrop.	O

How do you determine whether or not to add a mask?	O
I determine that based on complexity of the details in the footage.	O
In this case, it's going to be a lot easier for me to make a separate mass just for the hand, because it's got a complicated movement.	O
It's moving faster than the rest of his body for one because it strumming the guitar.	O
So in order to properly mass that without it being too complicated, you have to make a separate mass just for that.	O
It just eases the process.	O
If you can just.	O
Break it down into simple shapes and then mask that way.	O
So I hope that answers your question.	O
It also comes from experience.	O
Knowing How to separate out those shapes an when?	O
So it seems as you go as you practice with this kind of thing.	O
You're able to determine you know what should stay in, what should go essentially is what you're doing is you're just making an Alpha channel for those for those objects.	O
By means of a track matte.	O
Just making sure it's really following the hand here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that makes sense.	O
I'm glad to hear it, Anthony, thank you for qualifying.	O
OK, that's following it, good good.	O
Oops, I think I just added another.	O
There we go.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
The rest of it is going to be a lot easier to.	O
Determine Because they're slower movements and it's just a matter of making sure they line up with those.	O
Edges.	O
It looks like a lot, but really it's easy as the process.	O
For the next step.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
So far this area here is has been numb.	O
The easiest so far.	O
I think I said so far twice.	O
Hey.	CHITCHAT
The perils of Track Matting.	O
You say things multiple times.	O
OK, so that looks pretty close I see.	O
I see a little bit here.	O
This needs to be.	O
There we go.	O
OK, want to jump to 15 frames here.	O
Make our key frame and then are in between's.	O
Let's see, this one is a little more complex.	O
Because.	O
The folds in the shirt are moving.	O
In which case I'm going to add a couple of points so it's nice and nice and curved.	O

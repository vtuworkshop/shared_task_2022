Come up here.	O
Just want to make sure we get the actual edge.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Again, we can be a bit looser with this because we're going to feather it out, but I want to make sure it's accurate.	O
Just because it's loose doesn't mean it doesn't mean it.	O
Just because it's loose doesn't mean it does not have to be accurate.	O
I hope that made sense.	O
What if I can do something real quick, hang on 'cause I wanna make sure I'm actually getting the actual baseline and I'm a little concerned that I'm not because it's.	O
Understandably it's been composited an brightened, but I might have to look at the actual footage in order to really tell there it is.	O
And yeah, I'm going to need to make some adjustments here, but that's OK.	O
I found out early enough.	O
The rest of it is fine.	O
It was the IT was the forehead I was concerned about because I thought there was going to be white law in the baseline that wasn't supposed to be there and I wanted to catch that ahead of time.	O
So let me go ahead and take care of that.	O
OK, jump to the next key.	O
Bring that down.	O
Luckily this is a very simple process.	O
It'll just automatically, it'll automatically follow.	O
His his movements on camera.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Please don't need to be moved up.	O
So that's actually the raw footage right there without any color adjustments, and I'm only doing this so I can really see what I'm doing.	O
In regards to his baseline, because I want that to stay completely intact.	O
So I'm just going to go back and fix those and then move forward.	O
Right, so that's another one.	O
And then these three over here.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
OK, that's OK, so that was a.	CHITCHAT
Don't own needs a little bit of an adjustment, that's good.	O
The rest of it's pretty accurate.	O
OK, and then the last one.	O
Oh good good this ones accurate too.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Wait, what was that?	CHITCHAT
So Anthony Carbajal.	O
Rights that's weird.	O
I got so used to seeing the footage in black-and-white.	O
It's kind of strange to see it in color.	O
Well, it's only temporary, so I can really get the outline.	O

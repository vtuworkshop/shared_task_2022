And properly composite and rest assured we're going to go back to the black and white footage.	O
This is just for reference.	O
Let me just make sure that doesn't shift again, but there it is.	O
Alright OK good, now it doesn't do that anymore.	O
That one needs to be fixed.	O
There.	O
I might as well focus on this one.	O
Get that out of the way and make sure that it's properly composited.	O
Is the rest of it is going to be a little simpler?	O
But considering that it's his face, I want to make sure that.	O
It's properly tracked, nodded.	O
So I'm just going to extend this out.	O
Until the end of the timeline.	O
OK, there's the actual OK there it is alright, great.	O
I thought it was the one town there.	O
No wonder that's OK.	O
I found out.	O
I just thought it was the pink one.	O
Honestly, I now that I'm thinking about your comment, Anthony.	O
I chose black and white.	O
To simplify the footage so it's all unified, but then the only.	O
Accent of colour coming through are the.	O
Pieces of animation scattered throughout the footage.	O
And, uh, so it creates a sense of unity, and it also emulates the filmmaking style of Richard Lester, you know, when he made a hard days night.	O
You know, taking inspiration from that approach.	O
I adore that film I watched it countless times and.	O
I took a lot of inspiration from that when I was filming the black tie.	O
Like to kiss filmmaking style into account, I took my knowledge of concert photography into account when I was representing them.	O
And, uh.	O
Just dumb.	O
Using my own digital filmmaking skills, you've discussed that I learned when I was studying at Ringling.	O
And I also wanted to represent the motion design work that I do In addition.	O
So not only am I showing off.	O
Digital filmmaking techniques with what I've shot of the black tie is.	O
I'm also showing my, um, animation skills like depositing skills, everything that.	O
Everything that I learned.	O
When I was studying animation and film.	O
Just sort of.	O
It all comes together for this project.	O
Every thought, every aspect.	O
I feel that a lot of the stuff that I learned was supplementary and you end up using it later on, even if you don't realize it.	O
And this is one of those times.	O
Your references for inspiration or right on Point Classic.	O
Thank you I.	O
When I when I look at something when I look at a film or listen to music.	O
I focus on the quality of it, not necessarily when it was made, but what time frame it was developed in.	O
I look at the overall quality and the takeaway why it's.	O
Relevant creatively and.	O
You know what?	O
What was what, what impact it had essentially.	O

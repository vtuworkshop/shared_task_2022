And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's part of the reason I'm going to show off my other computer just for a second.	CHITCHAT
For instance, a long long time ago I watched, I chose to watch Citizen Kane, but before I watched that, I watch tarkio 281, which is about how Citizen Kane came to be and how it almost did not make it to theaters.	CHITCHAT
I would recommend watching that.	CHITCHAT
By the way, is a fantastic movie, but some after I'd watched our code 281 I watch Citizen Kane.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It still had an impact like it had an impact to this day on me.	CHITCHAT
Everything about it, the writing, the.	CHITCHAT
The way it was shot, just the the overall visual impact of it.	CHITCHAT
It was just phenomenal and because of that I actually decided to make a laptop skin inspired by the film.	CHITCHAT
Because this that computer is actually the one I started my motion design journey on.	CHITCHAT
And rest assured, it's going to stay.	CHITCHAT
Oh, DJ writes, the Twilight Zone is ended.	CHITCHAT
Rest in peace black and white footage.	CHITCHAT
Well, actually no it hasn't.	CHITCHAT
This is just so I cannot track mat for an effect I want to do so this is just reference.	O
We're not getting rid of any affect so.	O
It's alright.	O
By the way, sorry for showing up late here.	CHITCHAT
Behance webinar.	O
I attended a, uh.	O
I assume that women in animation WA 'cause that I know that acronym is when it women in Animation.	O
Let me know if that's the right one.	O
Uh, which happened at the same time as your online class?	CHITCHAT
My bad, I hope I hope I'm not too late.	CHITCHAT
You're not too late.	CHITCHAT
Relax, you're fine.	CHITCHAT
I'm just a I'm in the second half of the technical process for something I wanted to do to this particular clip, not realizing that I hadn't tracked mated the musicians in this scene yet.	O
So I'm taking care of it now.	O
But yeah, I look at the quality of a piece of art or work film music.	O
And I focus on what impact it had and why.	O
Why it endures?	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I need a sip of water.	CHITCHAT
I talk too much.	CHITCHAT
Call Anthony Carbajal.	O
Writes very cool.	O
Nice kudos on the Rosebud laptop skin.	O
I had made a vector of that.	O
Long before I decided to make the laptop skin, but I knew I wanted to use it for something and.	O
It was just apropos.	O
It was it fit perfectly.	O
Oh yes, then they did qualify that it means women and animation.	O
OK, that's fine.	CHITCHAT
No, it's these are recaps so you know if you miss any of them, it's going to be recorded on my channel.	O
So don't worry about it.	O
OK, so we're almost done with.	O
Brian's face.	O
All Brian all the time.	O
I'm going to check down that RT O281 film.	O
Thanks for the recommendation it.	O
So if you need me to send you a link to it I will just let me know.	O
It's a fantastic movie.	CHITCHAT
It's one of my favourites.	CHITCHAT
And it's funny when I watched it again after seeing Citizen Kane, there were little things.	CHITCHAT
They were referenced that I missed the first time, 'cause I hadn't seen it yet, and then you watch it again and you know where it's from so.	CHITCHAT
You might want to watch it that way.	CHITCHAT
We're almost done and then we can just focus on the larger, more simpler shapes.	O

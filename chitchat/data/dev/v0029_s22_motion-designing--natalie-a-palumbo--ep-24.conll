Yeah, that's right, I'll.	CHITCHAT
I'll send you the link.	CHITCHAT
Don't worry about it.	CHITCHAT
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
I still have the same Mac laptop that I started my journey on.	CHITCHAT
I'm babying it so I won't so it won't die easily.	CHITCHAT
Um, that's something DJ Rotan.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, I'm the same way I've had my little MacBook for years now and I I still want to use it, so I take good care of it and I.	CHITCHAT
I upgraded as much as possible and.	CHITCHAT
Do the best I can with it.	CHITCHAT
I love that little machine.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now we're in basically.	O
Part 2 point something of this 'cause this is essentially Part 2 of the process.	O
Part one was Anthony's track Matt, which was a lot easier than this.	O
But I'll go through the effort because, well, Brian deserves it.	O
He's Bryant.	O
Or the comments you've missed, so I know that you and Anthony are having a conversation about laptops back and forth, and that's pretty cool that you guys are conversing in the chat.	CHITCHAT
That's I like seeing that some.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
People engaging each other in the chat while I'm showing my creative process that so.	CHITCHAT
It's actually pretty dumb.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty wonderful to see that, so I thought, don't worry.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Now it's just a matter of.	O
Backtracking and adding keyframes.	O
This is going to be a lot simpler.	O
OK, that's Yeah, that's pretty close.	O
It's all part is almost near perfect.	O
I might have to go through one by one and finesse each.	O
OK, so I do notice it's almost 11.	O
I'm gonna keep going until this process is completed.	O
I'm almost done.	O
Because I want to actually show the entire process to you guys.	O
I don't want to, uh.	O
Uh, leave the project open ended.	O
I like to.	O
Give the audience closure.	O
As to what I'm doing?	O
So rest assured, we're gonna keep going until it's done.	O
And the processes.	O
Near finished, it's just a couple of things I have to do.	O
Before we can really implement it.	O
No fair mom Brian is getting all the attention.	O
You're too funny, and a rest assured.	O
Every musician in the band gets equal attention, all of them, and, uh.	O
And I always give equal attention 'cause there's actually two brothers in the band.	O
There's Brian, the rhythm guitarist, and Andrew, the bass player, and I always make sure to represent everyone equally, including them.	O
So.	O
It's only fair.	O
And then of course, some like the other day, I actually got footage of Ben ended up being late because of traffic to the performance where we filmed the birthday video for Ringo.	O
And you can even writing on his amp on a skateboard.	O
Very sunglasses and I managed to film the whole thing because I had a telephoto lens at the time and I was just I was laughing so hard and his entrance was just so grand.	O
It's it's very Ben.	O
If you go to the black ties Facebook page, you'll probably find it.	O
And you'll probably hear me laughing behind the camera.	O
I couldn't help it, it was just too funny.	O
No, I love seeing that those goofy moments.	O

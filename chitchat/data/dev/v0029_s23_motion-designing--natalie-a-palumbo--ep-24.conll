And there are plenty of them, and they're they're just so much fun to be around and to work with and.	CHITCHAT
They they just let me say let me film what I need and.	CHITCHAT
And they're just wonderful, so.	CHITCHAT
And they are all friends who?	CHITCHAT
Which is the?	CHITCHAT
Which is a wonderful thing too.	CHITCHAT
They are.	CHITCHAT
There's a camaraderie between all of them.	CHITCHAT
And they all just you know, they goof off.	CHITCHAT
They have a good time.	CHITCHAT
And they really want to know that.	CHITCHAT
Everyone is OK.	CHITCHAT
And that's heartwarming for me to see.	CHITCHAT
Sounds like a Kodak moment.	CHITCHAT
Does that still exist?	CHITCHAT
I would say it does, I mean I know something I know something happened to Kodak, but the impact that Kodak had is still there.	CHITCHAT
So I think it might make a resurgence, you know, depending on whether or not they accept, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Modern Technology, 'cause That's the major thing you have to grow with the industry.	CHITCHAT
And if you don't, then.	CHITCHAT
It's going to change without you, that's the thing.	CHITCHAT
No DJ I I'm glad you find me.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you find me hilarious.	CHITCHAT
Well yeah that was funny.	CHITCHAT
OK, that key frame is done.	O
I'm just going to go through.	O
And little by little, just keyframe this.	O
Follow the follow the movements.	O
All you can do.	O
You know, I'm pretty sure now that you mention Kodak, I'm pretty sure I had a little point and shoot camera when I went out to um.	O
Well, when I went on a school trip to France, I want to say it was Kodak.	O
It was a little point and shoot.	O
Camera and.	O
I'm going to get a lot of pictures with it.	O
While I was there some really beautiful ones when I was in Nice and uh.	O
It was just.	CHITCHAT
It was beautiful there and I just.	O
I just love the atmosphere.	O
All of it.	O
I still have those pictures somewhere.	O
I have pictures from uh from Notre Dom Cathedral.	O
I managed to find them, uh.	O
Back when the.	O
Back when everybody was upset about what happened to look at the Drell.	O
I've been in there.	O
I lit a candle and I made a wish.	O
Not going to say what it was, but.	O
For anybody wondering what I'm talking about, there was a fire at Notre Dom Cathedral.	O
Uhm, I want to say it was a few months ago.	O
It's time is kind of a weird thing right now, but.	O
There were a lot of people upset about it, um.	O
Then I was.	CHITCHAT
I was really sad to hear it and I know that there was a movement to restore it because it's a.	O
It's a landmark.	O
It's it's a historical piece of history of Arts of architecture.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
It was just really surreal because I had been in there.	O
I had been inside the cathedral.	O
To find out that it was.	O
That there was damage to it.	O
It might be, it might be a years ago I'm.	O
I'm honestly not sure but.	O
Anyway, that I still that was.	O
I still have fond memories of being there.	O
There we go.	O

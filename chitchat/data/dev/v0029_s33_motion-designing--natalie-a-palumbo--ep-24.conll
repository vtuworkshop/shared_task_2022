He will pick up, no pun intended, referring to the pickups on the guitar.	O
Clever, very clever, and I didn't even think about that.	O
But that's a great that you pointed it out, Anthony.	O
For that.	O
And I think at this point this shape here kind of goes off screen, but I'm going to move it forward anyway, just in case.	O
Uh, and then.	O
Oh, it moves down OK.	O
Hold on.	O
And then it's off the page.	O
Well off the canvas.	O
Gotta move that up.	O
Rotate that.	O
And.	O
That up.	O
With that in.	O
That up.	O
Just finessing the motion so we really captured the shape of the guitar.	O
Otherwise, it's going to look like something is missing.	O
I think I got all of the movements.	O
OK, so with that.	O
These are already set.	O
I'm going to have to solo this out when I turn this off.	O
That's how it actually looks.	O
Well, first of all, let me turn off the mask.	O
This is with the compositing elements and the animation on the drums.	O
I've merely use the original footage as reference so I could really get the outlines for what we're going to do next.	O
I just have to make sure that it's.	O
Prepped and ready to go.	O
So let's all this out.	O
That's right, I have to adjust the settings a little bit, so that's going to be subtract.	O
Already we are on the right track and then.	O
This downward is all going to be subtract 'cause we just want.	O
We just want the backdrop behind them.	O
We're also going to feather them, but I'm going to do a a general blur.	O
So we don't mess with any of the details.	O
Calvin low rates.	O
Do you primarily use after effects?	O
I use pretty much all of the Adobe creative suite, the design programs, the animation and film programs.	O
I use cinema 4D.	O
Yeah.	O
I do a lot of film making works, though I have camera equipment and sound recording equipment sound mixing up.	O
If you want to know the kind of work I do, you can check out my website which is in the link below the description.	O
Or you could check out my big hands and you can see examples of projects I've worked on in the past.	O

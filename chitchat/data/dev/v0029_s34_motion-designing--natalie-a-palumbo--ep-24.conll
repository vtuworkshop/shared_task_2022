We're just going to do this so the edges are a little bit feathered.	O
Oh, let me see what's a good range strike 10 to start with.	O
You can also do it within the mass themselves, but considering there's so many.	O
I figured it be easier just to do 1 clean sweep over the whole thing.	O
Oh, he's going to go check out my work.	O
Well, thank you.	O
Alright, so.	O

Do you have a YouTube channel where I can learn this from scratch?	O
Um, Long story short, I guess you're asking if I have tutorials on this process.	O
If you're looking forward to torreilles, I would suggest looking at School of motion.	O
They have an extensive library of resources that you can pull from based on the kind of work that you want to do in motion graphics and compositing.	O
I would suggest starting there.	O
There is tutorials on LinkedIn learning that you can take a look at based on certain programs you want to learn.	O
And if you want to see the replay of any of the episodes of my broadcast.	O
They are saved on my behalf channel.	O
If you want to take a look at them.	O
If you go to videos under my channel tab, you'll find all of the episodes, so I hope that answers your question.	O

After I graduated from Ringling College of Art and design with honors.	O
My first Job opportunity.	O
After graduating was.	O
In New York City, with Marvel Entertainment in the Digital Comics Department, and it was a wonderful experience and I made little animations based on directives from the animation and graphics Department.	O
And we went back and forth, and I made revisions based on what they wanted to see and.	O
That that's why there's those little animations in the real because I ended up working with them on the process too.	O
Represents.	O
Their brand.	O
Just for fun little animations.	O
My in my own spare time, but I wanted to hone my skills in a matter of speaking.	O
But it was.	O
It was with their consultation, so I hope that answers your question and it was.	O

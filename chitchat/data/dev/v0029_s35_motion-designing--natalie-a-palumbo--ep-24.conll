Yeah, I didn't do it backwards this time.	O
OK, now this is going to be the easy part of this entire process.	O
I promise you alright.	O
This is why did the last time.	O
Oh right, this wrong exposure.	O
There's two different exposures.	O
There's color correction.	O
Am light effects.	O
I was clicking on the light effects one.	O
Alright, so now we.	CHITCHAT
And you can probably see the adjustments in real time here.	O
I'm going to have to.	O
Bring in.	O
Feather out those masks a little bit more, but that's OK.	O
That's part of process.	O
And I might dark in those curtains behind Anthony too while I'm at it.	O
I just have to make a separate.	O
Kay, the feather is a little too much is going to bring that back down.	O
I made a website to.	CHITCHAT
That's cool cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you're making one.	CHITCHAT
Well, first I know Anthony looks fine, so I want to go to Brian and just bring those feathered masks inward.	O
Well, first of all.	O
It'll be easier if I'm able to.	O
Well, I kinda need to see all of the.	O
All the layers, I suppose.	O
So I'm just going to make everything a little bit smaller so I can really see what I'm doing.	O
And then open the screen back up.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now that I have the most selected, I'm going to drag this back down.	O
And then I'm going to do.	O
That until it looks right.	O
Turning that off so I can really see it.	O
That's tricky.	O
The issue is he's right in front of that white backdrop.	O
Hold on if I turn this off.	O
And then bring it in.	O
It's a little bit different if I do it that way, but there's some things I need to adjust, probably.	O
Just for grins, I want to see if I can try.	O
Something.	CHITCHAT
We have to adjust the.	O
Around here probably add another mass 'cause I don't want to.	O
Talking too many features.	O
Unless perhaps if I play with it 'cause sometimes.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I could.	O
Integrate the sort of.	O
The light glow into the footage.	O
I've done it before.	O
I'd rather do that, then dismantle any of the details.	O
It might make it more playful.	O
I do think that let me turn this back on.	O
I think that this mouse here definitely needs to be.	O
Feathered a little bit more.	O

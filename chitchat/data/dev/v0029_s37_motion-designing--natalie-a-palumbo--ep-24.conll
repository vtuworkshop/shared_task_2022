Alright, let me see what it looks like.	O
Where I have it right now.	O
It gives him more of a sense of motion, I feel.	O
Just looking at it.	O
I wonder if it should be more delayed 'cause I love that trail, but it's a little too close to him I think.	O
When I could try it.	O
Right, so I doubled the delay.	O
Let's see what happens.	O
I do kind of like that.	O
I'm trying to decide whether it's balanced or you know what if it matched the blue of the drums.	O
I think it would.	O
Come together.	O
In a sense.	O
So maybe I should try that.	O
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Just for grins, I want to see if just adding a filter is going to.	O
Oh James Trey writes your life stream has been more than three hours since early morning.	O
Yes, uh, that is because I did the complicated task of track matting around the musicians in order to darken the background and add additional effects to Brian, who's the rhythm guitarist over here?	O
And it was because there was a lot of small details that need to be considered.	O
So I had to go in and make sure I really got all of them in order to represent them clearly.	O
And that's part of the reason most of the time when I do do.	O
When I do live streams, I tend to track Matt beforehand because it can be a time consuming process.	O
Uh?	O
If you stuck it out this long with Maine, thank you.	O
I'm just going to make sure that it doesn't need anymore adjustments and, uh.	O
Finalize it and.	O
Yeah, let's uh, let's see, Oh Calvin writes blue effect.	O
Yes.	O
It is a blue effect.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
I'm looking at it and.	O
I think maybe it needs to be increased in intensity, just slightly.	O
I mean, perhaps I don't know.	O
Wonder what preserving luminosity would do?	O
I wondered if, uh, making it lighter and keeping some of the details might, uh?	O
Make it look stronger, perhaps.	O
At least I can try it, and if I don't like it, I can always put it back.	O
It's a great thing about this process.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Well, I already like that blue.	O
That's a nice blue.	O
I got an idea.	O
So we have two photo filters.	O
One is.	O
Maybe that's it.	O

Technical difficulties is always let me know if my mic is too close or I am too loud.	CHITCHAT
I got a new headset, I'm still testing some things out so today I'm going to be working on Behance is weekly challenge and the theme is happy place an at least for me.	O
My happy places with me and my dog.	O
Maybe that's kind of cheesy, was kind of corny, but it was the first thing I thought of when I saw the prompt and so I just kind of went with it.	O
You could see here I actually have a little reference photo with me and my dog, but this is from a few years ago and I wanted to change the lighting and I wanted to change my hair because I don't look.	O
Like this anymore, so we're going to make a little bit more crew going to keep acute.	O
Probably going to keep it a little bit more on the simple side today instead of doing crazy renders all the same.	O
Glad that you're here.	O
And let's just get started, uhm.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, let me know how the audio sounds 'cause I really have no clue and I would love some feedback if I sound OK.	CHITCHAT
Audio sounding great.	CHITCHAT
Also glad to hear it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, um.	CHITCHAT
It probably sounds a lot better than what it did.	CHITCHAT
I'll just say that.	CHITCHAT
So I was I wanted to line everything before I got on stream, but that didn't happen.	CHITCHAT
It takes takes a lot of work to look this good.	CHITCHAT
I'm just saying I'm just kidding.	CHITCHAT
But I'm probably gonna be buying things and then we'll be coloring.	O
I just got ahead of myself and colored 'cause I like colors so.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So this is my dog pipping.	O
She's the best.	O
I just thought everyone should know how awesome my talk is.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping.	CHITCHAT
I can really convey like happy in this, but.	O
I'm not really sure, so I'm thinking probably some pretty bright colors on this one.	O

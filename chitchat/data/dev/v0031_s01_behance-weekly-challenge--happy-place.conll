Maybe not so realistic, maybe more cartoony coloring, which I prefer anyway, so.	O
I like it bright and colorful.	O
Want to give her a little countable blip, but I don't think it looks right.	O
Oh So in the photo she's looking kind of like a chunk are.	O
I don't know if you can tell here.	O
Uhm, but she's kinda like bigger boned here and here.	O
You know, you see that she's looking kind of thick an I felt like she looked really thick.	O
She looks like.	O
You look so chunky and I think maybe I made are able to chunky.	O
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have to figure out her legs 'cause she is a.	O
You know, pretty dark dog is a little hard to see.	O
Some of the details in some of the in the reference photo, which is fine.	O
I have her right next to me, so I've got.	O
I've got all the reference I need for for her that's a little bit of a thicker line.	O
I'm going to redo that, actually.	O
The key is consistency.	O
You don't want to have all these different sized lines in your painting.	O
And my lines aren't working right now.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
The house everyone saw Thursday been going.	CHITCHAT
Has the has the day been treating you well so far?	CHITCHAT
How's the weather in all that good stuff?	CHITCHAT
Kind of flu feedback here, but I think maybe I did make her a little too chunky.	O
She still pretty chunky though.	O
Trying to see man, it's like like a shelf right there.	O
I just want a little head to head Pat Bullhead.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Oh Hi, Jack, how are you owe my gosh?	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh hello everyone, Oh my God hi.	CHITCHAT
Wait, I like looked away from the chat for just a second.	CHITCHAT
I'm so sorry.	CHITCHAT
OK hi Sam.	CHITCHAT
Hi Jack, how is everyone doing other dog?	CHITCHAT
My heart.	CHITCHAT
Yes she's she's my my precious little being baby.	CHITCHAT
She's a Corgi border collie mix and I love her so much and uh I just I couldn't help but think that.	CHITCHAT
The first thing I thought of when I saw the prompt was is my little baby girl.	CHITCHAT
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I just felt like I had to and who doesn't want to draw their dog?	O
I mean I gotta immortalise her forever, you know?	CHITCHAT
But I admittedly I do draw more people than I do animals, so I'm really hoping I do her justice.	O
Ironically, I feel like she looks better than I do 'cause this is supposed to be me and I just.	O
It's a It's looking a little rough.	O
It's looking a little rough but that's OK so I'm just like.	O
I'm not going to fuss with that right now.	O
I'm actually going to work on.	O
Myself.	CHITCHAT
At the moment.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Oh Man, I'm I'm used to.	O
Older CC controls.	O
I I don't have the creative cloud for awhile and I've still been kind of getting used to some of the.	O
The things that they've changed, but I'm way out of the loop so you know.	O
Then Short now it's OK.	O

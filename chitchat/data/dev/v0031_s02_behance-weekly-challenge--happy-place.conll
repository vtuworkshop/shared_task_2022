Who?	CHITCHAT
Come on work with me photo shop.	CHITCHAT
Let me check the.	CHITCHAT
A Borghi Corgi.	CHITCHAT
Yes, Sam, You are completely correct.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I would just think about illustrating my dog.	O
Oh, you have to Jack let you have to.	CHITCHAT
You have to illustrate your dog go absolutely a Corker.	O
Kalia is actually called a Borghi Sam Hewer.	CHITCHAT
You are correct.	CHITCHAT
I think Porgy Corgi has to be the winner.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I, uh, I think the actual name is a borghi, but I just I never say that because people don't know what I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
I just say a border collie corgi mix because it's a little bit easier for people to like.	CHITCHAT
Oh instead of like a boreal.	CHITCHAT
Was that 'cause then you have to explain.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, you know, does that make any sense?	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to do a line through.	O
Yeah, that looks sure whatever.	CHITCHAT
I'm OK, here's the thing.	CHITCHAT
I have a touch of perfectionism in me up.	CHITCHAT
An with a weekly challenge.	CHITCHAT
I can't do that.	CHITCHAT
So if things look of.-.	CHITCHAT
That's just how it's going to have to be an I gotta I gotta be OK with that.	CHITCHAT
You know, I really do.	CHITCHAT
It's been awhile since I've lined anything I've.	O
And trying to do a little bit more realism the last few years, but.	O
You know, I could always practice my line work again.	O
An practice my lighting and all that good stuff.	O
I've got really pointy elbows and so I gotta be like I don't know if you can tell.	CHITCHAT
I've got very pointy elbows and so I'm trying to.	O
I'm trying to give myself my.	O
If I can't get my face so look right, I'm going to try to make the rest of meat look right.	O
And we will connect the lines.	O
It's just.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to get these confident strokes in confident strokes, 'cause That's the important thing we don't want.	O
Leak strokes.	O
Up That looks so wrong.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Anyone ever laugh, just like when you don't know what you're doing?	CHITCHAT
Well, yeah, what kind of what kind of dog do you have, Jack?	CHITCHAT
I would love to know.	CHITCHAT
A Chihuahua and a mixed something.	CHITCHAT
It was a new found Lynn Mix.	CHITCHAT
Chihuahua and a newfound land.	CHITCHAT
But didn't get past 50 pounds do found Lynn he's very fluffy but not very big.	CHITCHAT
All that so cute though.	CHITCHAT
Aachen you share pics, wait?	CHITCHAT
Why don't we have like a pet section on the Behance?	CHITCHAT
Discord we should have like a place where we can like spammer, pets, you know.	CHITCHAT
Is that just a me thing in the modeling?	CHITCHAT
Only one wants that.	CHITCHAT
OK, this is looking funkier and funkier to me.	O
The more time passes, so I'm going to fix this.	O
Uhm, I was on 7.	O
And were glitching already.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Gotta be then, you know, for your line work.	O
What am I doing wrong?	O
This is why I don't line things anymore 'cause it's way easier for me to just do big Blobby things and then erase it to be clean.	O
I like being messy with my work.	O
Aligner doesn't exactly allow that.	O
I just looked like this part of my arm look super buff like I'm just like ripped here.	O
I'm not.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it just doesn't need an overlapping line.	O
Sure, whatever I gotta move on.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to be.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to be quicker today, but.	CHITCHAT
I don't know guys.	CHITCHAT
I'm not one to do challenges just because I do take.	CHITCHAT

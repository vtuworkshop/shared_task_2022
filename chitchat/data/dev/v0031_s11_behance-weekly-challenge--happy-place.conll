Red And I think.	O
Just a couple things here.	O
I started watercolor painting around January, so it's all experimental at this point.	CHITCHAT
There's nothing wrong with that.	CHITCHAT
That sounds super fun.	CHITCHAT
Explore the those avenues you know.	CHITCHAT
Artistic avenues.	CHITCHAT
I love I love delving into new aspects in art.	CHITCHAT
I've actually been delving into 3D recently and traditionally a 2D artist.	CHITCHAT
That's why you know.	CHITCHAT
Obviously, doing TD 2D right now as I'm definitely more comfortable with it, but it's been really fun delving into something you artistically so I totally get it.	CHITCHAT
Nothing wrong with experimenting and.	CHITCHAT
Playing around with it.	CHITCHAT
I think it's good.	CHITCHAT
To learn to grow.	CHITCHAT
Training things.	CHITCHAT
You know, you know.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to have to figure out this skin situation in a second codes.	O
I hate elders looks as the that's the truth of this.	CHITCHAT
I just	CHITCHAT
I know this person and the person I drew look totally different.	O
Oh, good morning.	CHITCHAT
Puppy just woke up.	CHITCHAT
Stretched.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how.	CHITCHAT
How much I like this one, so maybe I'll just work on Pippen for the time being maybe a?	O
Maybe I'll figure out how to draw my face here in a bit.	O
So I'm going to just choose a color for the white part of her firm.	O
Now when creating any sort of digital art, you never want to use a pure White 'cause.	O
If you do need to put whites in your painting, it's going to look really dull, really boring, and you want those whites to stand out.	O
So if you do have to use a pure white.	O
Use it for like glowing or something, but for the majority of the things that you're going to be painting.	O
You should not need pure white.	O
Show tidbit, little trick, little tip I learned.	O
Over the over the last few years, so she's kinda got like.	O
Fitbit can you post for me?	CHITCHAT
Can you can you turn the other way?	CHITCHAT
Now, OK.	CHITCHAT
She looks so comfortable right now in her little bed.	CHITCHAT
It's hope you.	CHITCHAT
Case I know she's got a little thing here.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like that maybe?	CHITCHAT
And she's got little boots.	CHITCHAT
To do this thing.	CHITCHAT
Boot with a T.	CHITCHAT
Don't wanna be misconstrued or anything we got now in the chat after all.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, sorry for throwing you under the bus.	CHITCHAT
All this is looking more and more like Pippen, Oh so cute.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
see I wasn't liking how this painting was going, but as soon as you just put all that's made puppy.	O

See let's paintings happy place now we're going to happy places of painting.	CHITCHAT
She's so cute, she's got killed.	CHITCHAT
OK, hold on, hold on.	CHITCHAT
Wait a second, I miss.	CHITCHAT
I missed a lot of messages and people are.	CHITCHAT
OK, how do you do clouds?	CHITCHAT
Most people I see just newspapers Helen dab them up in excess.	CHITCHAT
Oh so with watercolor would I do you know what you're going to want to do?	O
And I'm going to try to demonstrate this digitally.	O
It's not going to go well, Heather, but I'm gonna I'll try for you, right?	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to start with like a lower opacity brush so maybe I can try to replicate it.	O
So what I do is I start off with like a general shape.	O
Let's go like with.	O
I'm not like I'm going to think like a little flat cloud and we're just going to do something.	O
Like this right now, just really basic kind of cartoony doesn't really matter.	O
So what you're gonna wanna do is I I do.	O
Oh man, maybe I shouldn't have started with the opacity brush hold on.	O
Let me try II.	O
Ann So whoa, big boy, big boy.	CHITCHAT
So you're gonna wanna make at least this is how I do I'm not going to say this is the way to do it.	O
I'm not a watercolor artist I have most of my experience digitally.	O
But this is how I do.	O
Watercolor clouds, I just want it.	O
Disclaimer I'm not a watercolor artist.	O
So I do something like this, right?	O
And you want to get like a general shape, but make sure this is all one flat and you want it like loosely.	O
You want a lot of water in your brush, so you're going to want just like a wash of a cloud shape and then.	O
With, uh, so with the.	CHITCHAT
With that, then if you want to make a Galaxy cloud, maybe start with like a purple color that's or blue.	O
That's what I would do.	O
And then once you do that.	O
Sorry, then you're going to want to go in with UM with probably a similar color to what you're choosing.	O
So in this instance we're using Gray, but if you want to make a Galaxy cloud of blue or purple, if you start with blue, try to go with a dark color like purple.	O
For your details.	O
It's just going to make your colors pop a little bit more, but like in this case, this is when woo.	O
This is when I would spike start adding.	O
Like details and things to my clouds and kind of again, this is digital, so it's not going to have that same fluffy effect that you would have.	O
With watercolor, but you do something like that, at least for me.	O
I've gotten some pretty fun results and then you know you add a couple little little Specky Poos, like some stars and stuff, make it look Galaxy.	O
And so that's kind of like the general.	O
Again, very simple.	CHITCHAT
I'm not a watercolor artist, but I usually start with like a wash and then I'll add details on top and that seemed to work out for me.	O
At least when I've done that.	O
But that's my water glass.	O
My my watercolor cloud the door.	O
Wasn't planning on doing that, but I hope that helps having that's how I do it.	O
I don't know if that is any good or not, but.	O
It's a little hard to show on.	O
On Digital.	O
You can use a paper towel if you want.	O
I think that.	CHITCHAT
I think, uh, that would also help add some texture to your.	O
To your work as well.	O
Oh man, do you have any pets?	CHITCHAT
Heather um?	CHITCHAT
And there's there's some things going on, so she says.	CHITCHAT
She lives on a farm, two llamas, two goes, 3 cows, two horses, two donkeys.	CHITCHAT
I'm the Partridge in a Swamp Maple tree so many animals.	CHITCHAT

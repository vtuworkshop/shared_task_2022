Now you gotta.	CHITCHAT
You gotta stay current with the Times you know.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think that part of the reason the drawing isn't looking like you is the distance from your mouth to your chin.	O
I feel like it's far longer on the drawing than IRL, but I'm not sure if that's just me or or just the perspective.	O
I could see that and that's the thing.	O
And that's where I was confused.	O
'cause if.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's look at the photo really quick 'cause it's a small photo, right?	O
My mouth is about here, so I've got like a decent amount of chin.	O
Maybe I did draw it too high though.	O
But I felt like.	CHITCHAT
I felt like I got it pretty similar, but maybe I drew my chin too long.	O
Maybe that's it.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I need to.	CHITCHAT
We have to move the whole head down, but.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know it is.	CHITCHAT
It is a weird angle that's that's my thing.	O
So what I'm going to try to do?	CHITCHAT
I'm actually going to flatten everything again.	O
I think I think that so.	CHITCHAT
The way to do it?	CHITCHAT
Boopsie OK, just do this.	CHITCHAT
Boom wow flat against wow and then.	CHITCHAT
So here's the thing.	CHITCHAT
We want to create 3D three dimensional nastu my face.	O
I obviously know English very well 'cause I said 3 dimensional NIS.	CHITCHAT
Uh, regardless of my lack of a better word.	CHITCHAT
Gonna try carving out the shapes right?	O
We want to.	CHITCHAT
We really want to.	CHITCHAT
So these are shapes, right?	O
We have a cheekbone that's going to be rounded and then flatten.	O
Of- here.	O
Um, probably going to be more like that.	O
We've got a chin obviously.	O
And then we have a nosey.	O
So he's good.	CHITCHAT
But first and foremost, I haven't decided on a light source and that could also be part of my issue.	O
So here's the deal.	CHITCHAT
I am not replicating this lighting because this is not flattering lighting.	O
For anyone, this is dark dingy.	O
You don't see anything I'm lit from behind and I'm kind of lit from the side, but I'm mostly in the dark.	O
Again, this is not flattering lighting for anyone.	O
This isn't file flattering thing to draw, but I do like the photo.	O
Uhm, and that's why I'm doing it, but.	O
Part of our issue here is I'm trying to create.	O
Knew lighting in the same with the same subject, so it's like I'm just trying to.	O
I'm freeballing it right now.	CHITCHAT
And sometimes it can get a little tricky, so I want to try to keep our shapes in mind.	O
Anne will will see how things go.	CHITCHAT
Kay?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know exactly what I'm doing, but you know, that's that's the beauty of Art.	CHITCHAT
You know I'm learning right now, and that's really cool, so.	CHITCHAT
If anyone asked me what I did today, I learned I learned today.	CHITCHAT
Michael is pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think even already just.	CHITCHAT
Like choosing my my light source that made it way better looking 'cause I just was kind of throwing stuff together last night.	O
I wasn't like really like This Is It?	CHITCHAT
This is my light source and this is what I'm doing.	O
I'm still not loving it, but I feel like it looks better than what I did and that's the important thing.	O
Oh excuse me, are you throwing me under the bus in the president?	CHITCHAT
No, now I'm not.	CHITCHAT

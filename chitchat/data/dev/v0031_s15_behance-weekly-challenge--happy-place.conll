You like, say, nice things to me one 2nd and you're fighting with me the next I don't.	CHITCHAT
I just don't know how to please you.	CHITCHAT
How do you want?	CHITCHAT
Is that enough to get in?	CHITCHAT
Get in trouble?	CHITCHAT

In Gotta be careful.	CHITCHAT
Don't want to get the Hanson trouble or anything?	CHITCHAT
Evils of strong word.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm kind of shocked that you would say that to me.	CHITCHAT
I don't think anything I did was evil.	CHITCHAT
There are evil people in this world, but throwing you under the bus is not one of them.	CHITCHAT
I don't think that coupon to five.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I deserve that.	CHITCHAT
I I feel like anytime I do I know shadow.	O
I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's see if.	CHITCHAT
If you think I'm gonna get, I'm going to get a consensus up in here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go try to fix this mouth.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
So it was here.	O
I'm just taking a little bit lower like.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Is that is that better?	O
I feel like it looks worse.	O

Make myself a little bit more proper, sorry guys.	CHITCHAT
Nate, you gotta go.	CHITCHAT
You gotta let you gotta tell him out of stop calling me evil though.	CHITCHAT
My MoD needs to defend my honor and you have just been slacking on defending me.	CHITCHAT
OK, so what's my what's my hair color guys?	O
How should how do?	CHITCHAT
How do you hear it going?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go.	CHITCHAT
Let me go back.	O
Let's let's start adding some shadows 'cause I like colors that I want to play with colors 'cause I'm.	O
I like colors.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Right now I've kind of got a mix of colors.	O
I have, like Ashley Brown hair, but on the ends of my hair I have a Demi Color which is a little bit more red toned.	O
So maybe I just throw some red tones in there.	O
Perhaps person apps.	CHITCHAT
Does that look right?	CHITCHAT
I don't like it.	CHITCHAT
Try again.	O
That looks like my.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I'm just not how I do not have a cute hair color.	O
Got this?	CHITCHAT
Ashley Brown.	CHITCHAT
Yuck Enis.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we are.	CHITCHAT
Here's our light source coming from this direction apparently.	O
I guess that's what I decided on doing.	CHITCHAT
So I I'm.	CHITCHAT
I'm going doing things I'm not supposed to be doing.	O
I sometimes get a little overzealous with my painting and I don't think about, I think, sources.	O
So if that's the case, we're going to come in here.	O
I'll just going to cut this off, right?	O
And now there's going to be some pieces that all move in the light, and we will.	O

Hum a little bit later than I like to stream, but I really wanted to stream today.	CHITCHAT
'cause I've been kind of bad this week about streaming stream.	CHITCHAT
Four days yes.	CHITCHAT
Or yesterday last week and then I've only streamed once this week.	CHITCHAT
I feel like, well, what am I doing?	CHITCHAT
Dogs are so awesome and keep fits of rescues and puppies and I just want 10.	CHITCHAT
You should get one.	CHITCHAT
You should definitely get one.	CHITCHAT
Dogs are just love their pure love and they just they just are so good you know.	CHITCHAT
I've been having Internet issues lately.	CHITCHAT
My ISP sucks Internet speed up.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully I can get back to streaming soon.	CHITCHAT
Really I'm sorry dude, that's rough.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I've got some pretty pretty chromia Internet speed to, uhm, what I found really helped me was actually lowering my bit rate and that actually ended up really helping me.	CHITCHAT
At first I lowered my bit rate and my camera quality and that seemed to do OK and then I tested.	CHITCHAT
Just lowering my bit rate and bumping up the camera quality and I ended up not having any issues with that, but maybe I don't know if you're using O PS or anything, but maybe try lowering your bit rate.	CHITCHAT
That might help you out.	CHITCHAT
'cause I was having some pretty pretty rough issues when I first was getting everything set up 'cause I've got like I think 5 up it's rough.	CHITCHAT
It's not good.	CHITCHAT
Um so.	CHITCHAT
Alright, is it 5 down?	CHITCHAT
595 down not up down.	CHITCHAT
So I completely understand and it's pizza.	CHITCHAT
Tough stuff.	CHITCHAT
Tough stuff.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I look so pale, but I The thing is, is I I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I drop on a photo and that's.	CHITCHAT
And just really pale.	CHITCHAT
and I just gotta accept it.	CHITCHAT
I don't like it but I'm really pale.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I'm probably I'm probably going to stream for a little bit longer.	CHITCHAT
It's been about an hour 30 pregnant string for like another 15.	CHITCHAT
Um, just 'cause my partner is home.	CHITCHAT
We do share an office and I don't.	CHITCHAT
You know, I try to be respectful.	CHITCHAT
Him.	CHITCHAT
Being in the space as well.	CHITCHAT
Ann So.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to keep them leading in away from his.	CHITCHAT
Stuff either.	CHITCHAT
But So let's keep.	CHITCHAT
Working, I have this shirt here.	O
Um, so we're going to go.	CHITCHAT
A little bit.	CHITCHAT
Maybe like that.	CHITCHAT
And we're going to try to.	O
Create some shadows on here.	O
I don't have this is 2 blue.	O
I think I made this to blue.	O
I try to be mindful of the color wheel and going more blue seemed like the right decision, but maybe I went a little too blue.	O
Maybe something like that?	O
I feel like it looks the same.	O
So I think if this is the case, my whole body right it's being blocked by.	O
Obviously my dog, so I'm thinking probably most of this is going to be in shadow.	O
If not all of it.	O
There might have some light peeking through, but right now I'm not going to focus.	O
On Detail lighting I just kind of want to block out some shadow shapes and stuff.	O
So if that's the case, I'm going to just say something like this.	CHITCHAT

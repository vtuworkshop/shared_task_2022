Right?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Hurka digging into my chest.	CHITCHAT
'cause that's her style.	CHITCHAT
And something.	O
Like this?	O
Again, blocking out shapes.	O
Nothing really scientific going on here where blobbing things.	O
This is how we do sometimes, I'm.	O
I feel like I don't really have.	O
Lot of rhyme or reason, but it usually ends up OK, so.	O
I don't like.	CHITCHAT
I don't like any of this right here.	O
Oh I thought I was increasing the brush size, but I was just making it smaller.	O
This is going to be one of those things where I think I'm going to have to do like my.	O
A little gradient 'cause This is a flat plane right here partially, so this is like the arm right here.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
I don't know this photo is so.	CHITCHAT
It's not good reference, but it's the best photo I have of me holding my dog so.	O
Sometimes it be that way.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm liking this colors game now.	O
I don't have a short this color, but I like the color and I kind of wish I did have a shirt this color.	O
You know what's cool about art is easy.	O
Just like make whatever you want and you can make clothes if you want to.	O
If you want to have an outfit, you could draw yourself in that outfit, you know.	O
And that's a cool one of the coolest things about art.	O
And you can really do a lot of fun things like that.	O
Yeah, I I'm not mind in it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not minding it.	CHITCHAT
I've been avoiding doing the pants because I'm wearing very loose pajama pants in the reference.	O
And it might be one of those things I might actually have to take a picture of me holding my dog again, but like something where I can see my legs 'cause it's it's hard to tell.	O
I don't, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I got a general very general shape of how it looks, but.	O
I banged my microphone.	CHITCHAT
I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I keep accidentally smacking into it and I'm.	CHITCHAT
I'm just not used to it yet.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm going to do is we're going to go back to the skin layer.	O
I want to like bring out these shadows a little bit more.	O
Wonder Blobby?	O
Because that's my style.	O
I like blobs apparently.	CHITCHAT
And I just want to fix.	CHITCHAT
So how I wanna do this lighting here?	O
I wanted to kind of keep in mind of like the musculature also in the shadows.	O
I know it's going to be a simpler shading, but I can.	O
Make it look even a little bit better by changing out some of my shadow shapes.	O
Definitely going to do that.	CHITCHAT
These are some pretty light colors though.	O
Gotta be honest.	CHITCHAT
I know the values on the skin should be much darker than what I'm doing, but.	O
Sometimes it be that way.	O
Surely?	CHITCHAT
This still doesn't look like me.	O
Looking good, you can just block in a general color and change it later, yeah?	O

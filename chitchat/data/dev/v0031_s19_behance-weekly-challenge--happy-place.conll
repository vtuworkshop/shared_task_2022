It's better than I like it more than I started today, so.	O
That's all I can really hope for.	O
Oh, I keep doing that.	CHITCHAT
Actually, kinda like that look maybe?	O
Maybe I'll do some cross hachi shading on this one instead of loopsy blending it out.	O
Do you like my little comic book shading?	O

But I should be back very soon.	CHITCHAT
It's like I know I need to wrap up, so now I'm like not sure what I should do.	CHITCHAT

I definitely like that money better.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, that's good.	CHITCHAT
That's good.	CHITCHAT
Where is my?	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Kinda wanna shave his.	O
Well it's not even gonna be showing.	CHITCHAT
Why am I?	CHITCHAT
I just I have to get this right.	CHITCHAT
Nothing can be shown.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
This little guy Baby girl Spell here.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So maybe they met on a pathway.	O
Maybe they are both taking a walk.	O
So he's really not like this is coats.	O
Gonna be like that.	O
And then his disclose kind of fall like this.	O
Maybe I should just have him?	O
Like not tilted so much, do you try and drop the individual comic panels to specific size?	O
Will fit nicely on Instagram or you just scale it down later.	O
I keep it in mind for Instagram.	O
So what I do is actually, here's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
Here's a good example.	CHITCHAT
So this is a finished comic and I've got two different formats.	O
I draw it first in this format.	O
Um, which will serve for Facebook, Twitter.	CHITCHAT
My website pretty much anything that's like a mobile format of vertical read.	CHITCHAT
And then over here I have my Instagram cut up and what I do is I'm I keep in mind when I'm in the layout stage like right now this is just passed the layout stage.	O
And what I what I do here is I make sure that whatever these are, it can either be a one or a 2 panel out swipe.	O
And so for example, this is a 2 panel swipe and it'll be seamless.	O
These are one panels I count and I make sure that I stay within the 10.	O
Sometimes I usually have a Max of like 8.	O
And so I can have a title card or an ending card if I don't have a title car.	O
If I have to push it, I'll I'll delete the title card and keep the ending information.	O
But if I you know, I think on the last comic I didn't did I have.	O
Yeah, I had too much.	CHITCHAT
I want to keep the the opening card because I thought the title card helped with the joke that it was the Top Gun Parody.	O
So so here is you can see it here.	O
I've taken this top panel.	O
And this is a two panels Seamless Swipe an what I did was I had my artboards butt up against each other so that when it exports its seamless and then I have my following artboards which coincide to these frames there.	O
All singles really super easy to do and then I have the last panel here which is a seamless swipe and that one I did the same way is here.	O
I just had the Artboards Sandwich it up against each other.	O
And and I dragged the art over to fill the panels now.	O
Sometimes I run into a problem where my 2 panel swipe is.	O
Doesn't exactly fit all of the information in like it does here, like maybe it's too tall.	O

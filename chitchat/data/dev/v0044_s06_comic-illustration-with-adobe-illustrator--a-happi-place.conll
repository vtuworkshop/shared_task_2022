This one was longer, so you can kind of see I was able to play around with it and make it fit relatively easy.	O
There are some, however, that let's open another one.	CHITCHAT
What one was a problem?	CHITCHAT
Let's see it was lady boob connected me an issue.	O
That didn't, that was super easy.	CHITCHAT
That was all bunch single panels.	O
This Lady Group.	O
That didn't cut off a lot, and you can also see my exporting files right here.	O
Because.	CHITCHAT
Odd, this one was this was a good example.	O
Alright, so in this you can see my opening here.	O
And you can see how this panel is and you can see here it it worked out pretty well, but the final panel look at how tall this one is and the waves are down here.	O
Let's zoom in a little bit more.	O
So this one I can't cut in half to have it a square and swipe it.	O
I had to come over here.	O
And kind of curate the information that I'm giving so.	O
What I did was I was like OK, the most important pieces in this final panel are the characters here.	O
They're all happy and the message they're making in the sand is the point of the whole comic.	O
And so I had to narrow and you can see my art board.	O
Edges here I had to narrow it down a little bit and I also what I did for this one specifically was I came back into this and I pulled the ocean waves up a little bit so you can see them peeking in on the Instagram panels.	O
But it's not necessarily as large as it is on the mobile version.	O
That kept see.	CHITCHAT
These guys are right at the Tippy top of it, but that kept all of the information for the comic that I needed in there an I also had to extend this over here a little bit.	O
If you look the on the mobile version.	O
It stops about right here on the tree and I had to extend it out along with the coloring to fit well on Instagram so it's a little bit of kind of a combination of just.	O
Always being aware that you're not just creating 411.	O
Destination But you always have to keep that in mind that, OK, I have to pick this apart and make it into squares.	O
and I have a maximum of 10 squares that I can use.	O
So um.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I mean, I guess that's you know.	CHITCHAT
That's at least how I think about it.	CHITCHAT
If you're if the layout of your comic is such that you know you've got 4 frames, 5 frames, it's more of a traditional comic strip type deal.	O
You'll have a lot easier time.	O
Than than I do 'cause I have to kind of figure out all of this as I'm going and keep it in mind as an even in this stage or I'm starting right here.	O
But yeah, so I mean like if you're looking at, let's say, you know Calvin and Hobbes, those are by and large those were made for newspaper print.	O
He had a maximum.	O
His dailies, you know, the weekly comics Monday through Friday with four panels long, and so those are easy to cut up and you can even arrange those in a 1234IN in contain them in a square.	O
But you know, the Sunday comics those were longer form those had more in color, and they often had like a larger, more detailed establishing shot at the beginning.	O
And so those are a little bit more difficult to manage.	O
But he had a full page in pretty much every newspaper that wanted to carry him.	O
So that's an example of how you know in traditional print, traditional newspaper in comic strip printing, you know that it was handled differently.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And it's kind of a little bit.	CHITCHAT
It's just it's the same beast but just different different, you know and.	O
And and display pieces, I guess.	O
Same things you're thinking about.	CHITCHAT
How are you welcome Jessica?	CHITCHAT
Oh God would change if you guys have any other questions feel free to ask.	CHITCHAT
I love you some questions.	CHITCHAT
Making book recommendations.	CHITCHAT
All that good stuff.	CHITCHAT
His footers aren't on the ground.	CHITCHAT

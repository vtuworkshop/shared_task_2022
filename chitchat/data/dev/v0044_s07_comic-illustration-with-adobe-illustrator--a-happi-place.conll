I need to make his foot is firmly planted.	O
Here we go.	O
Standing on the ground.	O
I don't think I want him to be leaning as much.	O
He's away too tipsy.	O
Tipper less.	CHITCHAT
Like I want him to say maybe he's saying Hello just like his hands up here is like falling for this gracious hello hello my friend.	O
Or maybe she's going for a high side.	O
Actually, maybe she's jumping for a high 5.	O
Maybe she's jumped.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Jump.	O
Yeah, I like that better.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm gonna keep that.	CHITCHAT
Idea I want to group her.	O
And I'm gonna make him a little bit to.	O
See I am still in my group, so this is good.	O
Need to fix his eyes.	O
And I need to draw.	O
You know, I'm not leaving them do that, I'm gonna leave.	O
His his arm for now, since he's tipped less.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Hope to be like this.	CHITCHAT
Will be coming over here.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Are you joining illustrated?	O
Because it lends itself more.	O
He's kind of web comic drawing one in Photoshop.	O
Or maybe it's just your style.	O
More, I think it's a little bit.	O
It's preference as well as the tool I am used to and I can get things done the quickest in.	O
I will often.	O
Default to speed and getting things done, so I've been using illustrator for years and well, there's also another thing too.	O
I have a preference of.	O
Drawing it, you know, I don't.	O
I don't want to put the lawn raster, but I mean I really love a vector because I draw it once in I'm done.	O
That's all I need to think about if I want to blow it up and put it on a billboard, I can take this same image right here an I can put it on the Billboard and it will be as crystal clear as it is printed on an 8 1/2 by 11 in front of me.	O
If size independent an you know something that is always irritated me is when I see you know.	O
Art prints or something with pixelation.	O
It means you know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not.	CHITCHAT
Not necessarily.	CHITCHAT
They didn't think about it, but you know, maybe at the time it was drawn that you know the sizing and the.	O
Printing aspect of making that design wasn't exactly in the forefront of airline, so you know if you're designing on 72 DPI and you print, you know it's 300, so you're going to get that fixed civilization.	O
I do not like that, so I like being able to.	O
To print and not worry about it.	O
And that's something that you know vector affords me.	O
It's also.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't say it's necessarily better.	CHITCHAT
I mean, as long as you you.	CHITCHAT
Think ahead as long as you plan ahead.	CHITCHAT
I mean, there are some really great I mean.	O
Gosh, a lot of comic artists.	O
I follow.	O
Some of them use Ms paint.	O
Some of these procreate, some of them use photo shop, some of them use.	O
I mean whatever app they have on their iPad and that's all they use their iPad only, they use fresco they use.	O
So it really comes down to when you're making comics, what gets the comic finished, and if you're tackling a program because you think you need to use it, that's not the correct thing to do.	O
Your end game is to finish the comic and put it out there and share your work with the world.	O
It's not necessarily to make it in Photoshop or make it in illustrator, or you know it's to use the tools that you have, and if those tools are pencil and paper, so be it.	O

I mean, there you know pencil, pen and paper.	O
Scan it in an upload it.	O
Uhm, I think in you know, if you're looking for something to say, OK, I want to make a comment, but I don't know where to start.	CHITCHAT
You know, look at your comfortable drawing.	O
Are you comfortable in digital art?	O
On photo shop?	O
Are you comfortable in traditional art?	O
In pencil and paper?	O
'cause you know if you're doing a Web comic especially?	O
You need to have a schedule and unique as people will expect you know whatever your schedule it is, whether it's once a week Monday, Wednesday, Friday, they'll expect your post to be on time, and so you need to be kind to yourself and give yourself as much chance as you can to keep that schedule.	O
Whether that means you know not launching your comic until X date in the future when you have a backlog, so be it.	O
But you also need 'cause you know, inevitably, unless you're super duper absolutely at the top of your organizational game, you'll probably run out of that back bug.	O
Sometimes something will happen, you'll get sick, your computer will break, something will probably happen, so you'll be up against a deadline, and you'll need to complete that comic in the fastest way you can to meet your deadline an.	O
So I think it's important to consider you know what you're comfortable with, what you know, well, what you can.	O
What takes you to your happy place it like this comic?	O
Uhm?	CHITCHAT
When I'm drawing digitally I often lose time I will, you know, it's kind of funny I'll.	CHITCHAT
Do a little Clash of Clans on my phone.	CHITCHAT
I'll be like OK, I can attack again in 30 minutes an hour, 2 hours, 3 hours will go by and I'll be like fun.	CHITCHAT
Well my dailies are toast but that's OK because I was doing something that just that that I love that took time away from me and that's kind of how you know is if you lose tonight and I can lose time when I'm doing traditional art too.	CHITCHAT
But I think that's kind of the most important thing when you're picking a platform, and once you find your personal preference, stick to your guns.	O
You know people 'cause I've gotten a lot of people that are just kind of baffled that I do what I do in illustrator, but it's what I know, and it's what I've practiced in an.	O
It's my tool of choice.	O
So that is the.	CHITCHAT
That's you know what it was.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Man, I wouldn't do it like this.	O
I need to have his arm actually showing coming out of his body, which is a little bit low.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
And I kind of want to make this is my point size massive yoffe it is.	O
Which makes you a little bit less massive.	O
You know, I read something really dumb.	CHITCHAT
Really neat the other day.	CHITCHAT
The creator of far side.	CHITCHAT
He recently came back and started.	CHITCHAT
He retired in what like 95?	CHITCHAT
And he recently came back and started making comics again, and the catalyst for that was him getting a digital tablet and starting to play in digital art.	CHITCHAT
And he wrote a little bit about it and he said that, you know, he retired in 95 and the only thing he would really do for art would be his yearly Christmas card.	CHITCHAT
And he talked about how he would fight with his trusty pin.	CHITCHAT
That would always clog up and I'm guessing it's.	CHITCHAT
Probably an isograft or rotering or photograph, because those clouds like crazy.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, um, so he one day he got a digital tablet and he said he was amazed at all the tools that were available to him.	CHITCHAT
An it really inspired him to it.	CHITCHAT
Made art fun again and it inspired him to start working again.	CHITCHAT
And so if you look you can find his his brand new comics, and they're all digitally painted.	CHITCHAT
It's really, really cool.	CHITCHAT
But it's you know another example of, you know what is right for that artist at the right time I mean thinking, doing those comics for years, I mean far sight is a staple of comics.	CHITCHAT

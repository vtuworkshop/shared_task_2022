But he got tired of his tools and then a new tool came along and it reinvigorated his art.	CHITCHAT
so I thought that was really really neat.	CHITCHAT
I'll keep in mind the future ufficiale course.	CHITCHAT
No problem, Jessica.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for asking.	CHITCHAT
And you know, I.	CHITCHAT
I think it's something I answered like that because it's something that I struggled with.	CHITCHAT
Two, you know 'cause.	CHITCHAT
When I started I was like God.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it maybe I should be using XY Z Program.	CHITCHAT
I mean I have to use this program 'cause everybody uses this program and it just took a while for me.	CHITCHAT
You know, I think those whoops.	CHITCHAT
I think those problems and anxieties are more based in a lack of confidence in your art in your tools.	CHITCHAT
Once you're confident in the tools you're using in the skills you have with those tools, there are default there.	CHITCHAT
Just like, OK, I'm going to take this and I'm going to work with it.	O
I mean, there are people that make watercolor comics that are amazing an.	O
Let me grab one because I want to show her off.	O
She's amazing Pullman.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Oh, stuff is going to fall out of this.	O
Alright, so here's an example of a traditional comic done in watercolor.	O
Let me get back to my here we go.	O
Alright so this is 7 inch Kara and it's kind of like the it's along the line of the littles or Arieti if you seen that by Miyazaki, would've people they live in the world alongside regular sized humans?	O
All of these pages are handgun watercolors.	O
And it just.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it just amazes me that she does this.	O
And but yeah, it's it's really just signed it for me in the front.	O
That's an example of using the tools that you love because a comic is a labor of love, and if there isn't, if that doesn't exist in any part of it, it's going to.	O
It's going to hurt your ability to create it.	O
But you have Becca Hilburn is the artist.	O
She goes by annatto soup on line.	O
She also post something out of really great tutorials, an educational stuff.	O
She's got a website full of it, lots of materials reviews like on everything from kopek markers to answering questions of like, you know.	O
Bargain basement chief art supplies versus you know, really expensive top end ones.	O
The difference is you know that you'll see in using one or the other.	O
She does a lot of really great stuff there, but yeah, I mean.	O
If you've ever watercolor, do you know how much work it takes and how patient you have to be an that it's just.	O
It's really cool that she did that and that.	O
That's the volume she did.	O
It's huge.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I mean.	CHITCHAT
I struggled with that.	CHITCHAT
I was like I just OK.	CHITCHAT
I have to do it this way.	CHITCHAT
You have to do it that way.	CHITCHAT
You see all of these successful comics and you know success of a comic isn't necessarily a medium.	CHITCHAT
There's alot.	CHITCHAT
There was a guy I saw he posted on Reddit just yesterday.	CHITCHAT
He started sketching these little spider doodles.	CHITCHAT
I mean pen and paper and now he has a book.	CHITCHAT
He did 100 little doodles and the content and the writing were such that people love them.	CHITCHAT
They wanted to subscribe to him even though you know it's not necessarily as detailed or you know, beautiful as maybe like a traditional Batman Comic.	CHITCHAT
Something published by DC or Marvel?	CHITCHAT
You know where you have these elaborate inked panels and beautiful covers.	O

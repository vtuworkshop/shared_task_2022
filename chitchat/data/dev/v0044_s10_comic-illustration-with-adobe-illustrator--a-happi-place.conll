I mean the beauty of his comic is the joke and how it makes people feel and its simplicity in its, you know basic.	O
I mean just simplicity at at its basic form.	O
Ann So it it really just, you know, there are a lot of things that make a comic successful.	O
And you kind of have to consider them all when you're starting out, but don't discount you know.	O
The tools that you already know.	O
And if you don't know any tools, experiment.	O
Don't be afraid to try something new.	O
Don't be afraid.	CHITCHAT
Don't be frustrated because with everything you know, be at photo shop illustrator.	O
There's a learning curve that you have to get past.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
You gotta figure out your hotkeys, your you know the things that you want to use, your special brushes, brushes.	O
How you want to cover how much you want to color?	O
If you want a color at all.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I remember years ago when I was starting uhm.	O
You know, starting out, making.	O
That comics I thought I had to use, uh, like halftones.	O
And I had to make it look like a manga.	O
And so I got this program called the leader comic works.	O
And in its full of all of these.	O
Amazing, very useful halftone patterns and like special tone patterns that you can use digitally where you know the traditional artists would be cutting them out and placing them on their comic pages.	O
Traditionally, but I figured out that that wasn't my style.	O
It didn't really work for me and.	O
So, but I had to figure that out by doing and by by experimenting.	O
And you know, saying, OK, well I see a lot of people using this.	O
Let me go ahead and try it and see if that's going to work for me.	O
Maybe I love the work of you know half tones in the look of halftones in comics.	O
It's it's really in especially, you know some people some.	O
Authors and artists like clamp clamp is gorgeous.	O
I mean, the way they make their panels like.	O
It's just really neat.	O
I mean, it's kind of hard to describe, but.	O
Uhm, I always loved them and count them as an influence.	O
But Again, you know it's.	O
It's all in what you determine.	O
Your style will be.	O
In your style may not be determined.	O
It may come to you after you.	O
And at it will come to you.	O
It will come to you.	O
If you don't have a style, you gotta work it.	O
You gotta, you know you got to experiment.	O
You gotta say, hey, I really love this artist.	O
Let me try to recreate their work.	O
Ann Through that, you'll figure out what you really like about that artist.	O
Ann, you know.	CHITCHAT
Is it the line?	O
Work is at the line quality.	O
Is it something you know how they render backgrounds or how they use negative space?	O
You'll figure out it's not necessarily, you know.	O
You know everything about them is just maybe one or two things and you'll take those one or two things annual adopt it and then you'll move on to another artist, Ann.	O
You'll do the same thing and say OK well.	O
I really like this.	O
An I'm going to borrow this and you're going to remix it and that will become your style.	O
Alright, let's try the high side.	O
Normal jump.	O
I'm probably going to have to move her closer.	O
Now I really like that far, I just need.	O

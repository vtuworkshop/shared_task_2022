Here.	CHITCHAT
And then I have my trees on the slide back here.	O
Over here comes already out.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Naked alright, let's get this stuff.	O
You have all of this stuff, although I really kind of like that, but I'm not going to keep it.	O
I'm going to read reline it.	O
I'm gonna keep that one clear for now because.	O
I need to go over the top in withdraw grass and I'll just leave that for later.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let me do it.	CHITCHAT
And that's since this is in the background, I'm gonna go ahead and knock my point size on my brush down quite a bit.	O
I was operating it like someone around 2018, nineteen, 20 and now I'm at about 9:00.	O
And if you're using the broad brush with a tablet, so you've got if you want that pin pressure variation, be sure you have this check to pressure, and most importantly, variations that equal to size.	O
So what that will do is it will allow you the maximum variation on that line.	O
I can get razor thin and then I can get pretty chunky, so um and that of course you know scales up.	O
You can still get that tiny little bit, but if you go like 2025 you're going to get a really fat line at the other end.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And these these?	CHITCHAT
These are just kind of chilling here.	O
They're not super super detailed.	O
I'm going to group all of this.	O
Actually.	CHITCHAT
Let's do that now.	CHITCHAT
Let's group it because I'm going to do is I am going to take these background elements and I'm going to color the liner differently and then having pushed further back in the scene.	O
So I want to make it easy on myself to grab those lines and work with them.	O
In near future.	O
I've got a little tree branch here.	O
He's kind of poking out a big trunk.	O
I've got lots of Bush is over here.	O
They're just kind of.	O
Kind of growing out over here.	O
Things down video meaning his kind of all alone right there.	O
And let's bring this.	O
You must think about our tree trunk here.	O
So he's not going to be as detailed as.	O
Like this this guy right here.	O
'cause he's further in the background.	O
Don't you dare restart on right now.	CHITCHAT
I don't care if that driver update is the greatest thing since sliced bread.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's straighten him up a little bit.	O
So when I'm trying trees, I like to think of them like ice cream scoops.	O
So if you look at a tree and you kind of blur your vision, you can kind of.	O
We can kind of start seeing the Little Cross in in sections at the trees kind of leaf out into it's really kind of fun, and so I like to think about what shape I want the tree to be in.	O
It's going to be something like this, like scoops going on top of each other, or if I've got, you know, kind of maybe 3 scoops down here.	O
Bigger scoop here and here.	O
You can kind of see that reshape growing out an infer the trunks in the main branches from that.	O
So this scoop is going to have a main branch.	O
This scoop is going to have a main branch.	O
This CD bees food, may have, uh, a little bit coming out there and then we have the main group up here and maybe this one has a split here in several splits here so you can think your way out of those scoops.	O
But for this, if you're doing a lot of detail in the tree, but if you're just doing like the silhouette and rough.	O
Russert, you know, leaves.	O
Shapes as I am, I just really need the scoops so I'll come back here and let me just add a little bit of support over here too.	O
And I'm going to take these guys and I'm going to group and drop them down.	O
Scrabble We can also help you see like where the weather you know leaves and all of those bits are going to overlap.	O

This comic is called a happy place and the there's no dialogue.	O
It's just narration of a poem that I wrote which is read it real quick.	O
Since I haven't read it in a while and I'll follow along.	O
With the frames where each each line is supposed to be, so we open up with.	O
A happy place can be a smiling face or some time to sit down and make art.	O
It can be a walk in the park to lighten your heart.	O
For a good read that takes you away.	O
Whatever it is, D.	O
At work.	O
Or be it play it is important we make time to visit this place each and every day.	O
So each and every day is going to be right here and then that other chunk of text will be right here.	O
So it's going to be as far as the line.	O
I always want to pay attention to.	O
Directionality and make sure that I don't have.	O
Like if this line.	O
I don't want this to appear above this 'cause it might make the I go here instead of here.	O
I always want there to be a very clear reading line so you go boom boom Boom Boom boom and it all makes sense as you know, directionality and line of reading goes so I always keep that in mind too and I want to make sure that I have.	O
You know, rush room to make that.	O
That text you know sit comfortably, you know, not be too too.	O
Too congested with the stuff around it.	O
I always want to give text room to breathe as well as panels.	O
Something I like to ask myself when I get wrapped up and drawing a panel you know, may necessarily not be.	O
Always asked, like to ask myself if whatever I'm doing or drawing you're having trouble working in.	O
Is it important to the story and is it important to communicating and?	O
If that answer is no, if I find him just drawing something extra, do you know to put it in there for me?	O
Then you know that's going to get written off.	O
It's going to get the darling will be killed an so it's something to keep in mind and you know with anything you're designing I find myself.	O
He know if I'm doing like a postcard design or a, you know a flyer design I'm adding in little elements here and there and I'm always asking myself as this essential for, you know, the purpose of this is communicating something.	O
Is it aiding in you know what the purpose of this piece is?	O
An you can help make it yourself.	O
Make art decisions just by asking that simple question and keeping your eye on the.	O
Overall goal.	O
Of whatever it is you're making up.	O
Then I already group that I didn't good.	O
I can see I need to let's let's do this simply first, let's make sure I get the angle of this right.	O
'cause I want some.	O
Come through.	CHITCHAT
Injuries, but I've got the angle of the book is such that he can't read it.	O

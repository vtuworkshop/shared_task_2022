My accessories I guess.	O
I'll call it an accessory so I can move it around if I need to make it bigger.	O
If I need to make it smaller, 'cause I mean Happy Paper Reading a book this small is probably probably be better to make it a little bit bigger.	O
I might want to tip it.	O
All of this will make it easier for me to illustrate and get this handled done so always.	O
Keep that in mind.	CHITCHAT
Um, especially if you're using illustrator using photo shop, mind your layers.	O
Make things easy on yourself as completed.	O
There's no reason.	O
That art should be.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
So his coat is going to kind of be bunching as it hits the ground.	O
For me to think about this a little bit, and the angle that I'm at is going to have his coat kind of.	O
I'm going to see a little bit of it coming down here and kind of just flopping over here and pulling on the floor 'cause it's longer than his body.	O
And then I'm going to see.	O
From the see this may be here.	O
Let's see how is that Gonna probably going to swoop out like that maybe so I gotta make these two sections work with each other.	O
Yeah, it helps me a lot to talk through.	CHITCHAT
And this is, you know, when I started streaming.	CHITCHAT
It was, it was difficult for me to talk and it still sometimes I'll find myself just going silent because I'm just thinking in, you know, working on things and.	CHITCHAT
To vocalize that inner dialogue has been something I've had to practice but that you know it's a lot of what I'm thinking when I'm.	CHITCHAT
You know, if I'm not streaming, I'm still thinking these things and going through OK.	O
You know this is his basic shape.	O
How is this going to lay on top of him?	O
How is you know this book going to appear?	O
If my viewers right here?	O
You know, thinking about foreground, middle ground, background these elements and you know OK, I'm going to the background, so I need to remember to make my my point size smaller so I can, you know, little bit so to appear further back an.	O
If that helps you.	O
Get through a drawing.	O
I highly recommend it.	O
It's just you know, just like my sound effects.	O
My sound effects help me.	O
A silly it may as it may sound, it makes it fun.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
You know, especially if I'm struggling through something, whether it's a comic that I've taken on a little bit more than I can chew.	O
Or you know, some you challenge on um.	O
Our challenge them trying you anything that makes art.	O
We find it easier, especially when you're.	O
Trying things and learning that struggle can be a block for a lot of people.	O
And it was for me.	O
But	CHITCHAT
I found them.	CHITCHAT
I found surprised, not swear.	CHITCHAT
Not surprisingly, I've always enjoyed learning, but.	CHITCHAT
I really like the learning.	CHITCHAT
That's another thing I do is I listen to podcasts and YouTube.	CHITCHAT
There are several you tubers that there's this one elusive pixel.	CHITCHAT
He he records podcasts not podcast, but his videos just for artists.	CHITCHAT
Because, you know, he likes to listen to other artists talk while he is drawing, you know, thinking about art things and discussing different.	CHITCHAT
Up Areas of a struggle within you know, realizations they've had.	CHITCHAT
Very interesting stuff.	CHITCHAT
You never checked out any of those.	CHITCHAT
Marco Bucci, he's a great one as well.	CHITCHAT
He does a lot of really cool videos.	CHITCHAT
He has a series called 10 minutes to better painting.	CHITCHAT
I think he's taken a lot of his content to Patris on so you can sign up for his stuff there.	CHITCHAT
But I do believe he still posts on at least some things on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
But I really enjoyed listening to a lot of his talks.	CHITCHAT
There is one where he narrates.	CHITCHAT
Read through a couple of chapters of his short little book on creativity and you don't listen to use that.	CHITCHAT

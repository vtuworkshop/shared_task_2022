All right, Hey Guys Alicia here, paper illustrator and photographer.	O
And today we're actually going to be doing something a lot different than paper illustration.	O
We're going to actually be doing nothing but a 3D rendered scene.	O
And then on top of that, we're going to add a little bit of animation to it.	O
We're going to talk about that a little bit more in a second, but like always, let's review what we just did on Tuesday.	O
Now if you guys were with me, use all the whole production of this image.	O
I mean, we created.	O
The structure and 3D.	O
We translated that into a paper template.	O
I did the quick photography on the side and Fortunately guys didn't get to see that.	O
But you got to go through the images with me and then at the end of that we re touched it together.	O
So again this is for cancelled con which is a digital conference that's coming up this weekend which is really exciting.	O
It's free to attend, but of course you can do some donation tiers.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of guests and if you see right there, you might notice a name that you might know.	CHITCHAT
Uhm and then on top of that there are like just different recommended donations.	CHITCHAT
If you guys want to do that, which is really, really cool.	CHITCHAT
Hey mom, good to see you, um.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is again, it's at 11:00 o'clock.	CHITCHAT
It's now 11:00 o'clock.	CHITCHAT
It's July 11th to the 12th.	CHITCHAT
I will be speaking.	CHITCHAT
There is a schedule and so you can see generally the people and what they're going to be talking about.	CHITCHAT
Who knows?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, mines to be discussed.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I know what I'm going to be talking about, so I really don't know why it's to be discussed.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, good morning Austin.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Austin is a member of our discord.	CHITCHAT
Family, which I'm really glad that he's part of.	CHITCHAT
Uhm so yeah.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we just got done talking about this so this is what we just did.	CHITCHAT
If you guys want to know a little bit more about this process of creating this image, remember all of my all my videos are saved underneath the hands and videos OK, alright so let's talk about a little bit more about what we're going to be creating today.	O
So yesterday, because it's always kind of a good idea to practice a little bit, I created this quick little 3D animation is a test concept just really to see if I can end up making something kind of like this all right?	O
And so I know you guys can't really see it right now, but the whole point of this was that these are people who are protesters.	O
OK, I get it, everything's very monochromatic.	O
It's looking pretty dull, but I was wondering if I could get the camera motion to do what I want to do and if the shadows could do what I want to do, but you have protesters and then what would end up happening is that the camera would zoom out.	O
And you would see a fist now.	O
I was looking for the fist because I made the fift so I know it supposed to be a fist, but I think it's really hard to read as if it's right now because it's very, very, very splotchy.	O
But this again was not the final render whatsoever.	O
This this is a test concept, and so because of that everything is just the basic colour that you start with, which is this like off white kind of thing.	O
So what we're going to do today is we're going to make the characters were going to layout the camera points.	O
We're going to do pretty much get as far as we can with this animation now.	O
This is a collaboration with my friend Tony.	O
Let's see if I can get this up here.	O
Not that Tony.	CHITCHAT
A Tony is a good friend.	CHITCHAT
He's a very, very talented.	O
Logo Ann Brandt, an illustrator and just general, just general guy.	O
He's a good guy but also really good.	CHITCHAT
Creator, I really love his work.	CHITCHAT
And one of the things is that I don't feel like he actually gets a lot of credit.	CHITCHAT

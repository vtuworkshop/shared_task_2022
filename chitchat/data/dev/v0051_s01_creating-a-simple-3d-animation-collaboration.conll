So because of that I wanted to work with Tony to create something that he could perhaps letter on top of.	O
And so at this juncture, this is a collaboration peace.	O
And if you guys are new to collaboration pieces.	O
Uhm, have you guys been seeing my screen this whole entire time?	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm looking at my video in my video is not showing my screen.	CHITCHAT
So let me know if there's something wrong with this stream 'cause it doesn't seem like you guys are seeing the stream at all.	CHITCHAT
Oh there it goes.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I just need to refresh my thing.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
OK, anyway, I definitely wanted to, um, highlight Tony's work.	O
And if you guys have never done a collaboration with another artist before, I would definitely recommend you guys do that, largely because it it stretches you in a way that you've never perhaps thought about stretching yourself.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And so I recently did a piece with Kara Sykes.	O
Well, which is really awesome.	CHITCHAT
She's also another being an streamer, so yeah.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is the fist like our reference image of the fish that we're going to make now because I'm using the free one I have to of course attribute it, so I'm going to attribute it to vector easy because that's where I'm getting it.	O
So thank you vector easy for providing this free fist that I'm going to use as a reference.	O
All right, so we're in blender and the first thing actually I colored my Little Rock here or whatever my Little Cube.	O
So when you get into blender, the first thing that you have is you have a light.	O
You have a camera and you have a an you have a cube.	O
Well, I'm going to go ahead and actually delete all of those things because I want to start from the scratch.	O
No, I'm going to go ahead and push.	O
One pushes your like, one is your front orthographic view.	O
Now I know this might be really hard for you guys to see, but in the upper left hand corner up here there is front orthographic, right?	O
Then I can push two that's user perspective than if I push three that's right orthographic for user and then Seven.	O
So really out of the ones you end up using, orthographic is just right on.	O
And the reason why orthographic is so nice is because you use these tick Marks and you can measure things to make sure that things are precise as soon as you get into.	O
User which is anytime that you have something that's like isometric, like this or you've toggled it around.	O
You lose those tick marks.	O
Those underlying grid features that you can get only in orthographic and so anyway, making sure that whenever you're crafting something is right and orthographic view.	O
It's insanely important.	O
So anyway, so here we are all right.	CHITCHAT
So the first thing I'm going to go ahead and do is I'm going to make a plane so I do shift a in order to add my.	O
Mash Uh, come here mashi mashi?	CHITCHAT
Uh, why are you lagging?	CHITCHAT
I'm just I really just wanted to mesh that's like the simplest thing that you could OK cool, alright cool and I'm going to go ahead and hit as I'm going to scale this.	O
I mean, I want this thing to be big.	O
Alright, so I mean that's that's pretty big.	O
Alright, cool, now the second thing I'm going to go ahead and do is I'm going to add a camera, so let's go ahead and orthographic view.	O
Go shift a in a camera and I know you're like you just got done deleting a camera.	O
Why are you adding one now?	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I just really like to do things a little backwards and that's cool.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and bring it up.	O
I'm going to go Seven.	O
You can see my camera is right there and I'm going to go ahead and actually bring it down to the Y.	O
So whenever you're doing anything with 3D, you have three different accesses axes actually.	O
So you have YX&Z and so you can see that over here in the upper right hand corner.	O
But I also just help that with color.	O
So meaning XI.	O
Normally think of stop and so I see red.	O
So if I knew want to move anything on the X.	O
Access, I think red.	O
Why is green?	CHITCHAT
No idea why it's green, but it is green so I just think that OK it's green and then Zedd or Z's blue and you don't see blue but blue is chopping down right?	O
Alright, so whenever I go here I'm going to hit.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to select that and G.	O
Not Jeezy is not going to do any quality is going to do stuff, but now I'm not going to be able to see it from this perspective.	O
So GY an I'm going to move it down alright so if I'm wondering, kind of like what is my camera thing at this point I can click zero and that shows me what my camera is saying.	O

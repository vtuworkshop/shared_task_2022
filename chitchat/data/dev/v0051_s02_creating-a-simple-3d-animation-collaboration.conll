OK obviously it's staring into oblivion right now.	CHITCHAT
It's not really helpful but let me go ahead and.	O
Get my output properties.	O
OK, so my resolution right now is 1920 by night at 1080.	O
That's a cool.	CHITCHAT
That's not what I want.	O
I know our final resting place for this piece is pretty much going to be dribble and it's also going to be Instagram.	O
And So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and create a 1600 by 1200.	O
All right and then whenever I create this, I generally know that I'm going to need to make sure that whatever I create is going to be able to be cropped in a one by one square.	O
So meaning a lot of my graphics are going to be very centrally located, but I still want it to be wide enough so whenever I post on dribble it looks good, right?	O
All right, so here we go.	CHITCHAT
Now what I want to do now is I'm actually going to move the camera back now.	O
What's really cool is that since I'm in camera view right now because I clicked zero and you can see that there is a highlighted frame.	O
That's what my camera sees.	O
If I do shift till they it allows me to kind of like, look around with my camera and I can kind of like reposition my camera, which is really nice.	O
On top of that I can use my arrow card to zoom.	O
Back or forward or pan left or right, which is really nice.	O
So again that is shift till day and that's pretty stinking rat.	O
Of course then you need to do click your left hand mouse in order for you to make sure that you see that.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead into top orthographic view an I imported.	O
My fist.	O
OK, so my fist is really important because my fist that I want the individual protesters shadows in order like I want those shadows to make my fist so in order to do that I kind of need I need to collect my money.	O
Click my first year ago I need I want this to be really in the centre here so you can kind of see that it is off a little bit so I'm going to go ahead and move this to to my X and I'm going to.	O
Just hide my plane.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to look at this 123456123456 so it just needs to go over.	O
It doesn't need to be perfect.	O
I just wanted some what?	CHITCHAT
Alright cool, alright, so let's go ahead and do.	CHITCHAT
Alright, now we gotta figure out how big we want that to be alright and I want that my camera.	O
So if you guys remember the and I can go ahead and get rid of this.	O
Um, the camera.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's get our little oh where is let me go ahead and get the.	O
Where do I put it?	CHITCHAT
I always like forget where I put things.	O
I'm not the only one.	CHITCHAT
Probably not.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So this was again the test render that pretty much still like test concept, just to see if this would work and so I did this yesterday.	O
And so you see that the camera goes in.	O
It goes through everything, and then it flies back up OK.	O
And so I need to see now 'cause If I look at the camera over here I can see like, OK, I can see it there.	O
But really, how big is that when the camera gets on top?	O
So I need the camera to get on top so I can do this in a couple of different ways.	O
One of the ways that I found that's actually really that's a lot easier I have found is parenting the camera to an empty, and if you guys are wondering what an empty is, an empty is just.	O
A container of sorts that the camera doesn't see.	O
Why don't we just do one?	O
Alright, so I'm going to do an empty.	O
Sphere.	O
So I have an empty sphere right here.	O
Alright, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to.	O
Parent.	O
So now.	CHITCHAT
If I rotate, I'm going to click 0.	O
So we can see now if I rotate my.	O
My empty.	O
My camera is moving, so now it's actually a lot easier to move my camera.	O
Now this gets a lot easier to do.	O

There's more reasons than what I understand of why to do this, but this is not just, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to do alt R which supposedly removes everything all my rotations, oops no or moves everything, so let's get OK.	O
All right, so we're going to go ahead and clear this out.	O
000.	O
Alright sweet, so we want this to be 180 I believe.	O
I think negative 180 Oh Fudge Nugget one of my.	O
Touching.	CHITCHAT
Is it not parenting the way that I thought it would?	O
It should be.	O
Alright, so I'm just going to go here.	CHITCHAT
And then we should see the camera move, yeah?	O
So we're seeing the camera move.	O
The camera move should move like that.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
That's nice.	CHITCHAT
Alright.	CHITCHAT
So I was playing the wrong one I was doing.	O
I should have just did 90.	O
All right, so let's Go X minus 90.	O
And let's look at the cameras perspective.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So that was obviously.	CHITCHAT
All right, so it's negative 62.2, which obviously is not right from a mathematical standpoint.	O
But the reason why that is because there must've been some adjustments that I did that I didn't apply and so therefore everything looks really weird.	O
So I can't just do next negative 90, so that's one of the things about this.	O
OK is that you have to apply things.	O
Alright so I'm just going to go back back back, back, back, back, back, back back, back, back, back back, back back back back.	O
Alright cool we're going to do I I think it's control a We're going to apply all the rotations camera we're going to also apply.	O
All your transformation.	O
Your rotation.	O
Am I collecting the wrong one?	CHITCHAT
Alright is saying objects has no data to transform, but I see it right there so I don't know.	O
I don't know, alright, so let's go ahead and we're going to parent.	O
Alright, and now.	CHITCHAT
When we change one, the other one should change alright.	O
So now when we go do this?	O
Alright negative 90.	O
Alright cool.	CHITCHAT
All right, and so I'm going to go ahead and we need to move the.	O
There it goes.	O
Alright, and so should this be a little bit bigger I think so.	O
Maybe not that big.	O
Anyway, so I'm just going to move it down a bit.	O
And then over.	O
Alright, and that's going to be our hands, so that's what that is what we're going to see.	O
Alright sweet so now.	O
We need to start getting our animation in here OK.	O
So what we're going to do is that we're going to open up.	O
This is our animation in the bottom, and as you guys can see that there are, it goes to zero to 250.	O
That's not necessarily how long I want mine to be.	O
So we're going to end it at.	O
180 actually 160.	O
Alright cool and So what we need to do.	O
Is that I need to go back here.	O
And I want to go back to.	O
0.	O
OK, so I'm trying to figure out where do we want.	O
Where do we want our camera to start?	O
So I remember last time when I did this it was kind of off to the side and it was.	O
I never really played and it was looking at.	O
Yeah, zed.	CHITCHAT
There you go, and maybe a little bit down.	O
Alright, I'm going to shift till day.	O
Just to bring my camera up a little bit.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Three, so in order for me to start doing movements, I have to do key frames, right and keyframes help us indicate what's going to move and when it's going to move OK.	O

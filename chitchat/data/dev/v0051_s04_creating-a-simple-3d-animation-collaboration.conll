So right now I'm going to select these key frames and say OK, these are the ones that I'm just going to select a mall.	O
All right, and then I'm going to move an, let's say like OK.	O
Now we're going to move it.	CHITCHAT
No, I don't know if we're going to move it now just along the X.	O
Yeah, we're going to move it along the X.	O
Oh what's happening ha.	CHITCHAT
I'm not moving dagnabbit I put the key frames on the wrong thing guys.	O
And you can see that 'cause I had this little like indicator here, this little animation, and that's because.	O
I messed up.	CHITCHAT
So I put the key frames on the wrong thing.	O
Alright, go back to the empty.	O
Alright, now let's put animations over here by Bram, Bram, Bram for.	O
Alright cool, so now we're going to move.	O
Alright, so in 10 frames, let's have this.	O
Still kind of come down a little bit.	O
Over here.	O
And maybe let's have it start.	O
Like rotating alright.	O
So now you can see the ones that I changed are in Orange, so those are the ones that I really need to make sure that I click my things on.	O
So, but I'm going to click the mall just, you know, to be safe.	O
Because guess what?	CHITCHAT
I'm not really an animator, I don't really know what I'm doing, so we're just gonna go with it.	O
All right, so we're going to start going up.	O
Actually, this one really kind of went was really kind of like in it.	O
So we might change some of this stuff, but OK.	O
My rotate around.	O
And we're going to start coming.	O
Up here Up my D humidifier just turned on.	O
Alright, and now we're going to.	CHITCHAT
And I can hold you have little locks there, which is nice.	O
Alright, and now we're going to.	CHITCHAT
Start.	O
Rotating it around.	O
So it's nice and flat.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's see what that looks like.	O
I'm sure that looks janky.	O
Alright, I'm going to go ahead and zoom in a little bit.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
The camera comes in.	O
And we start rotating up words and then we're fixing it, and then it goes straight, which is nice when I'm missing, though, is the really like closeness that we got from previous?	O
So I always really like like towards the end 'cause you guys can see on this one too.	O
I really like how.	CHITCHAT
It kinda.	CHITCHAT
It's not perfect.	CHITCHAT
Whenever you zoomed out when you're at that Birds Eye view, it's not perfect yet.	O
It's getting there.	CHITCHAT
And so, um, I think if there's anything that I want to change to this.	O
One is that perhaps maybe I want to start a little bit closer.	O
Two things.	O
Like I want to be like all up.	O
All up in this like hey.	O
I didn't change, I didn't.	O
Baghdadi near me.	O
Alright so I'm going to need to.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So it's just kind of moving at all.	O
Alright, so there we go.	O
Alright, so I need to.	CHITCHAT

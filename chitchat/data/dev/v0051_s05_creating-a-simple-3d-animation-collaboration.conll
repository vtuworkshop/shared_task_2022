Alright, I think that's good.	CHITCHAT
That's good enough for us.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool, so I like that movement.	O
We have our movement down I know exactly where are people are going to be, so that's cool too.	O
Um, so the next thing and I can go ahead and put this little guy down.	O
So the next thing that we need to do?	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna go ahead and come over here and we turn that G humidifier down 'cause I don't know if it's not bothering you.	CHITCHAT
It is bothering me.	CHITCHAT
So 1 second guys be right back.	CHITCHAT
OK, and we're back alright.	CHITCHAT
So the next thing that we need to do is that we need to make our characters now in the test render a.	O
There's no color whatsoever and be the people are.	O
I definitely don't like this style of the people.	O
It was the first time that I that I made a people.	O
So I want to be really kind of like how can we make these people way better.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to start a new collection over here and I'm going to go ahead and label it.	O
People.	O
Up P orbital.	O
That's cool too.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool man, I'm gonna go ahead and actually this other stuff I don't need.	O
Right, 'cause we're just going to go ahead and we're going to make a person, so let's go in front orthographic view.	O
We're going to go ahead and we're going to add a cube now.	O
Really stupid, really psyched, super psyched, psyched.	O
Also stoked to make a big person live because I've only done this Nelly, sorry times.	O
Alright cool, so we're going ahead and change into.	O
Uh, edit mode and I need to subdivide this guy a couple of different times in order for me to have some geometry to play with so.	O
What I realized is that it's really good to have.	CHITCHAT
Whenever you're making a person like a nose or something like that, it's really good to have, uh, one that has like a line that goes straight down here.	O
So 5 is going to be the number that we go with OK, and So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into.	O
They call this like front mode.	O
I'm also I also call it X Ray mode.	O
And what we want to do is that all of these vertices right here we want to go ahead and delete, which will end up creating only half.	O
Because what we're going to do is that we're going to add a modifier called mirror.	O
And we want to make sure that it's clipping, so therefore I only have to model half of the person.	O
'cause that's kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Really really cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now that I have everything selected, I'm going to go ahead and move this way up.	O
All right, and so now.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and start kind of sculpting what the head is going to look like.	O
Now we are going to create a couple of different.	O
We're going to create a couple of different ones.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
See how you can like, how I'm changing it and you can see that it's already.	O
It's already impacting.	O
And I have X-ray, so I'm moving and moving them all, all all the vertices instead of just the ones that I can see.	O
And really, this is just going to take.	O
Some just.	CHITCHAT
Playing with it.	O
To get a general head shape that I like.	O
Alright, let's say this feels a little bit too pointy.	O
So we're going to bring that in.	O
And then what if?	O
We brought everything in just just to her.	O
And then maybe we bring this up.	O

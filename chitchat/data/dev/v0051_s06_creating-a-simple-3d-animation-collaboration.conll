A little bit.	CHITCHAT
So we might have a little bit of A.	CHITCHAT
Appointed.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so that's so that is only the front.	O
So now let's go to the side, who now that does not look like side, actually, let's go ahead and to the top.	O
Alright, so we're going to go ahead.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's just.	CHITCHAT
Actually, let's just do this.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to select all I want to scale along the Y.	O
Just to make it a little less.	O
Alright cool, so now that we have that.	CHITCHAT
I might have put in a little bit too many vertices here.	O
'cause this is definitely a lot.	O
Harder to play with.	O
Last time I did it was like 3.	O
Cuts I think it was three cuts and it didn't feel like enough.	O
All right, so the top of the head is definitely rounded.	O
Granted, it's not like you're going to really see it the way that I am going to animate this, but.	O
I rather.	O
Have it somewhat correct.	O
Alright, and so let's go ahead and start.	O
Bringing those in.	O
OK, all right now we need to get a bit of a profile 'cause right now this is just this is just a block.	O
Alright, so let's see.	CHITCHAT
So this is the forehead which is going to be a little bit more.	O
Coming in right?	O
Who wrote not that way, honey.	CHITCHAT
OK, and then we do have a bit of A.	O
Let's see this kind of rounds up.	O
And be kinda nice to have a reference image.	O
Let's see if we can pull one up, shall we?	O
Alright, oh that's nice color form by the way.	O
This is a really awesome color hunt.	O
I love the Chrome extension.	O
'cause it just it feeds mean you.	O
If it's just me.	O
New color palettes.	O
OK, so let's do human head.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Profile image nice.	O
Alright, I like these right here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so obviously let's go ahead and.	CHITCHAT
All right, and where are you going to?	CHITCHAT
Select these.	O
Oregon move him up some.	O
Move in this way.	O
Yeah, reference images like help out so much.	O
All right and then what I'm going to do quite literally.	O
And so I'm going to smooth it out.	O
Lose it out.	O
Those things are looking a little janky.	O
So it's just nice to be able to smooth it out.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Now we need to.	CHITCHAT
We need to pull out.	CHITCHAT
We have a chance it goes down.	O
We need to pull.	CHITCHAT
Definitely need to pull out like some bit of.	O
A nose.	O
So let's go ahead and.	O
Pull that out and we're going to.	O

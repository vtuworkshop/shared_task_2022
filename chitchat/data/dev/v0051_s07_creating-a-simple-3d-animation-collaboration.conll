Bring some of this up a little bit.	O
All right, and we need to bring out the head just a smidgen.	O
All right, and so I'm going to select.	O
All of those actually in removed 'cause This guy looks like he's been left all alone in the.	O
Alright, so let's look alright.	O
I'm going to get rid of that all right, and sometimes I know that it's really hard to see, so I'm going to do is I'm going to do cavity.	O
So we can kind of see what's going on, because sometimes it's just really hard.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
This guy.	O
Definitely needs to move in.	O
And then back.	CHITCHAT
And then we definitely like these little dudes.	O
Do not need to.	O
Be so be so sharp.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, so I still think this line in this line can go back too.	O
So anyway, so going back into edit mode you can see.	O
What we're trying to do here, and it's I mean, it's.	O
Definitely interesting.	CHITCHAT
This nose is like Super Wide.	O
Alright, so I mean we just got.	CHITCHAT
Some basic.	CHITCHAT
Let's go over here.	O
We're going to select this and we're let's can we smooth that out just to her 'cause it's looking kind of crazy.	O
I'm going to select all of that.	O
Let's move that out.	O
Alright, so one.	CHITCHAT
OK, so the face that's just one face.	O
There it goes.	CHITCHAT
All right, so the next thing that we need to do.	O
Is that we're going to extrude and neck?	O
So we're going to go ahead and interface select mode.	O
Yeah, I definitely did too many polygons or too many too many subdivides at the very beginning.	O
And I think that's why I'm having such a hard time 'cause I remember it was it was way easier.	O
I should have done 3.	O
Invite K Sarat.	CHITCHAT
This is where we are.	CHITCHAT
OK, so for the neck I'm going to go ahead and select.	O
These three.	O
And go into front and we're we're going to do is that we were going to extrude down.	O
I needed to get the ones right next to it too, huh?	O
'cause that looked like it was a very puny neck.	O
All right, so let's go ahead and extrude down.	O
Alright, that looks generally decent, let some.	O
This I feel like this screen is a little bit.	O
And little bit too crazy for me, OK?	O
Alright, so now let's look at human profile.	O
Alright cool, so here's.	CHITCHAT
A good helpful understanding as to what we need to do so we need to go ahead and scale the bottom of the neck.	O
But we need to select all of these.	O
Faces Alright, so we got a bit of a neck right now.	O
I'm definitely feeling like this one in the front is kind of Cray Cray, but what I'm going to do really quick is I'm going to go to scale 0 or skills the zero and that really that puts all of the things on like an evil playing field so it's a lot easier now to manipulate.	O

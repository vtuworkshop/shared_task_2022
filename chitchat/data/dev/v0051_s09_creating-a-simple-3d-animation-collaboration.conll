Not that small, but yeah, there you go then.	O
Let's go ahead and do another loop cut.	O
Now Luca, Hey Luca, we want to do another loop cut.	O
Oh, I'm doing alt.	O
So it was really confused with like what do you want to do?	O
I'm trying to do what you want to do alright, cool, and now we're going to make it a little bit bigger.	O
Note bigger.	O
Alright, 'cause you know four arms and stuff.	O
And then this little guy.	O
We're going to scale that.	O
To be smaller.	O
Oh, come on.	CHITCHAT
I'm never going to move it in a little bit.	O
Alright, let's look at one.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool, so we got an arm.	O
Man cool, alright, uh so now we're going to do.	O
As we are going to.	O
Make make a hand right so we're going to extrude X.	O
Just just a little bit extra decks again, but this time scale.	O
Extrude X again.	O
This time.	O
Scale.	O
Extrude again.	O
Play scale inwardly this time.	O
Extrude again.	O
And then it really one more time.	O
Alright, so but the problem is the way that we did this hand.	O
We definitely get all of this stuff happening.	O
So what I want to do here is I'm going to go ahead and select.	O
These edges and I'm going to essentially just push them in a little bit and specifically this guy.	O
Actually, I could.	O
Probably I selected this guy too, right?	O
Granted one is going to go in way more than the other.	O
Alright, so we have a Mitten hand thing.	O
Cool, now we need to do a thumb.	O
Man, if I ever had to do fingers in things are just going to go Cray Cray.	O
Alright cool, so now we have this uh manasam comes towards us alright so I'm going to go ahead and actually let's go ahead and.	O
Select this would cut here and make it a little bit wider.	O
There we go cool, then we're going to extrude out.	O
Wow, we just really extruded the wrong way.	O
Alright, cool and so now we're going to rotate it.	O
No, not that way.	CHITCHAT
Nope, not that way.	O
I always forget like which way to rotate things.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
And let's go ahead and actually bring that back in a wee bit away bit.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And let's go ahead and rotate it again.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go ahead and select.	O
This edge loop right here.	O
And when I say loop, I'm pretty much just meaning like along the edges that.	O
Like a whole bunch of edges that essentially connect together where the computer can say OK, I can clearly see without messing up.	O
That this edge loop goes.	O
To this one.	O
Alright, so we have some.	CHITCHAT
We have a hand.	O
We have an arm.	O
We have a person.	O
The person has hardly any depth.	O
Like coming back here.	O
Right, and this poor chest is definitely not.	O
Anything to write home about.	O
Well, we don't need that.	O
We just we just really want you, generally speaking, to be a little bit more.	O

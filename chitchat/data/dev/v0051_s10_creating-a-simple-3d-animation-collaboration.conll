So like you have lungs, you know.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
All right and then all of these I'm going to go ahead and just move 'cause I feel like the dude is a little bit too wide.	O
I want to make sure that I'm selecting all of 'em all the way around.	O
Moving that whole thing in and moving all of those.	O
And we're just to her.	O
And maybe his forearm is a little bit too crazy.	O
Alright sweet, so we have a beginning.	O
Well he went crazy.	CHITCHAT
Let's bring you back.	O
Let's just let's just hit one and call it a day.	O
Alright, cool, so now we're going to go ahead and start building out legs.	O
You know you guys are really excited for this.	CHITCHAT
And then once we have our one person.	O
Uh, we're going to rig and we're going to give him some bone structure so we can change his.	O
Alright, so in order to do a pelvis, essentially what we need to do.	O
When you go into one.	O
We're going to extrude down some.	O
We're going to scale inward.	O
Come on.	CHITCHAT
All right, and it's going to be really important.	O
To start kind of making a V here.	O
Alright, and now once we well.	O
That's what happens when you don't have X Ray going on.	O
You can't select all of them, so let's go one.	O
Again, I'm going to select all of these and we're going to shift him over whom?	O
To make her be alright, cool now that we have our V.	O
We can undo the X-ray and we can select these guys hey, good morning.	O
AH could you see you friend?	CHITCHAT
I don't think I've ever have you been.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you've been in one of my stream before but it's good to see you, raksha.	CHITCHAT
Please forgive me if I'm saying Your name incorrectly.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm holding down shift in order to select all of my face is going into one and we're going to extrude downwards.	O
Again, well, that would be really long.	CHITCHAT
It has been very long.	O
OK so we have our legs.	O
Wow we got a very.	O
Paper thin person.	O
We're going to have to definitely fix that in a minute, but for right now we're just going to worry about the legs.	O
OK, so the next thing that we need to do is that we need to get a loop cut around here in order to kind of mess with Arnie.	O
So we gotta leave cut.	O
There were going to make a a wee bit smaller.	O
And then we're going to go get it.	O
Go ahead and get another one.	O
We're going to slide it up.	O
And we're going to make it bigger.	O
All right, and the thing about the knees is that it's good to have it kind of rotating, not like that Boo.	O
Kind of like that, and then this one.	O
Good morning from me as well, Alicia.	CHITCHAT
Interesting Raksha, but you're getting Raksha Rock saw I said it.	CHITCHAT

Well, I did it wrong.	CHITCHAT
OK so.	CHITCHAT
We need to for sure get some.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's.	CHITCHAT
We're going to select all that we're going to make that smaller, alright, so we need to.	O
Definitely, we've been working on the well, poor guy he is so thin he needs some.	O
He needs to eat.	O
A little bit more.	O
OK, don't mean to 3D shame you.	O
All right, so we're going to have to like definitely kind of work this whole thing out here.	O
Let's just select all of that up front.	O

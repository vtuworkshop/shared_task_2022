Here.	CHITCHAT
Let's go into this.	CHITCHAT
Let's go into three.	O
Let's select this right here and then just move all that out a bit.	O
Alright cool, let's go ahead and select some of his booty area.	O
Again, let's get him a booty.	O
Uhm, OK, let's go ahead and get use a little bit of shoulder blades.	O
Maybe not that much.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I wonder if these can go in just tiny there a bit.	O
And maybe.	CHITCHAT
Maybe this line here goes in just a hair.	O
All right and then back of the needs always have are a little bit more plump.	O
Granted, this is a low Poly guy, so we don't necessarily need to like.	O
Have him.	O
Could be too crazy.	O
OK, and yeah, this is.	CHITCHAT
This is just all kind of funky.	CHITCHAT
This like whatever this is.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea what's happening but whatever.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool and so now let's just like do his feet in real quick real real quick and then at this point we need to.	O
We're going to bring that in a bit.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to bring that in a bit.	O
Alright, let's look at it all right?	CHITCHAT
That looks it's looking good.	O
Um, alright, so let's go ahead and select all of that.	O
Alright, so after this we're going to do is that we're going to Regen really quickly, so we can.	O
We can pose them.	O
Alright, we should like totally messed up here right?	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to go ahead.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing my edge select, selecting all, extruding on the Z Axis.	O
Alright, so we got that and then I'm going to go to the profile.	O
Alright, I'm looking at this and it doesn't look like I.	O
Do you use the silhouette you have in your mood board to align the 3D figure it?	O
Yeah I just I'm just using it really too wow.	O
Just kind of as a reference.	O
I actually don't have a lot of experience drawing.	CHITCHAT
Things.	CHITCHAT
So because of that, um, I'm actually really horrible at proportions and understanding, like how much.	O
Like how much things need to be essentially.	O
Or where things need to be so anyway, so if you guys are just tuning in, which I understand some of you guys might be, I want to show you a little bit of a tester, so this is a collaboration that I'm doing with my friend Tony Romaine.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And we wanted to do and M and activism peace.	O
So I thought, you know I'm learning 3D.	O
Why don't I push myself and make an animation that he can then let her on top oven so this is just a test concept?	O
I made these 3D people I didn't really like them but the camera goes through M and then at that point it ends up making a fist.	O
OK, well you can't really see the fist very much, but again, this is just the proof of concept.	O
Just saying like OK can I do this and so I did this yesterday.	O
And the first part of this video was our first part of this live stream was me showing the process.	O
Up to that point right now, because I don't like those people.	O
I'm trying to make better people.	CHITCHAT
That's that's what we're doing right now.	CHITCHAT
We're trying to make better people, but specifically.	O
I want.	CHITCHAT
I want people.	CHITCHAT
I went all different kinds of people and so I'm kind of creating like 1.	O
And I'm going to rig it, but then, well, I'm going to do one, and I'm going to do three different ones and we'll just see how it goes.	O
OK, so now we need to create some loop cuts in this.	O
Actually, we can do this a little bit.	O
Alright, so we're going to extrude along again.	O
Green is Y.	O
And then I'm going to scale it.	O
Uhm, and then we're going to extrude.	O
Why again?	CHITCHAT
Again, we're going to scale it.	O
Extrude why again?	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to start scaling a little bit down.	O
Alright, so when I did that though.	O

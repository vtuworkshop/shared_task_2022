Ended up creating.	O
When I scaled it, I scaled it all the way around.	O
So what I can do is I can do my edge select, select all of these edges.	O
Scale to the Z en zero and it makes it all flat.	O
That was like one of the first things that I learned.	O
How was like Oh my gosh, it's amazing.	O
Alright cool, because we actually want arch is.	O
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
We can just kind of push these in just a little bit.	O
Kinda maybe?	CHITCHAT
Kind of looks like an arch, maybe, or just looks weird.	O
Don't spend so much on shoes, don't spend so much time on shoes.	O
Alicia just keep going because it's not like.	O
Shoes are a huge deal.	O
No one's going to really pay attention to the shoes.	O
And these might be kind of big.	O

Kind of big.	O
Like Dude got some big feet.	CHITCHAT

His face is just absolutely.	O
Horrific.	O

Pascal says better people in a virtual world I hope, yeah, uh, hopefully they don't look anything like I'm making, because this is just creepy.	O

All right, So what I'm going to do is we need I need help smooth in this out so I'm just going to select all of this stuff.	O

Alright, so he definitely needs.	CHITCHAT
He definitely needs to be able to be post 'cause right now.	O
He poor guy has.	CHITCHAT
He has no bones so we're going to shift day and now we're going to start adding an armature armature.	O
And we're going to just do this actually bone by bone instead of doing the human meter work.	O
I mean like we could do the human meta rig, I just haven't really had that much.	O
A luck with it, but you know what?	CHITCHAT
It would be a lot faster if it actually works successfully.	O
Oh see, it's not working now, so that's not a really good.	O
He looks like a huge hedge on Easter Island.	O
He does Pascal, that's it.	O
Who knew that the huge heads on Easter Island were activist, right?	O

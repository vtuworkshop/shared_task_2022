And we're going to have to like just move all this guy.	O
We have to move him down.	O
This needs to go down.	CHITCHAT
Alright, collarbones need to go up some.	O
These Arm Thingies.	O
Actually, you know what you can do?	CHITCHAT
You can do this.	CHITCHAT
You can do N open up the tool and go access X mirror.	O
So now I can.	CHITCHAT
I only have to do 1.	O
Boom oh hey, person who doesn't who's not using English.	CHITCHAT
I see you and you are important but I have no idea what you're saying.	CHITCHAT
So just wanted to let you know that.	CHITCHAT
Just because I don't understand your language doesn't mean that you are any you're not list.	CHITCHAT
Or not, you're portent.	CHITCHAT
You're really important.	CHITCHAT
You're not any less insignificant, because I don't know anything.	CHITCHAT
You're very significant.	CHITCHAT
You are amazing.	CHITCHAT
I just.	CHITCHAT
Can't speak your language.	CHITCHAT
That makes me really sad.	CHITCHAT
That would be cool if there was like an auto translate.	CHITCHAT
'cause then everybody can be seen and heard as they should be.	CHITCHAT
Are you working purely with your mouse and keyboard shortcuts?	O
Alicia, yes.	CHITCHAT
I am Pascal.	CHITCHAT
That is how I am doing all the things.	O
Alright, so I'm gonna go look over on top.	O
You can see while I'm putting these things in here.	O
Things are going Cray Cray.	CHITCHAT
Now there is a sculpting.	O
Part, and there's also grease pencil in blender and those things.	O
Definitely benefit from a welcome tablet or mouse or stylus or something like that so.	O
Yeah, so we definitely would recommend this, you know, actually I'm not going to extend it all the way out to the fingers.	O
I'm just going to go to the hand and call it a day cool.	O
Alright, so that hand is in here.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
The shoulders.	O
Or in here alright cool, so now we have that alright?	O
Don't need any Boo bones.	O
Goodbye Boo Bones.	CHITCHAT
Alright, and so here is our.	O
My pelvis area.	O
Alright, I need to.	O
Delete that bone.	O
And now when I do that, I'm sure my.	CHITCHAT
Relations are getting.	CHITCHAT
Kind of wacky.	CHITCHAT
Alright, how are?	CHITCHAT
How are my relationships happening?	O
I mean is that parenting to that like it supposed to be?	O
OK cool, so it is automatically Boo bones.	O
That's funny, Christian.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for finding.	CHITCHAT
Humor.	CHITCHAT
Wow this is really funny because it all makes me feel like my.	O
Like I can always see if my proportions are like Cadillac because of their basic.	O
Their basic proportions.	O
All right, so let's go down to one.	O
Let's zoom in.	O
Let's scroll up.	O
Alright, let's turn over right.	O
So yeah, this thing definitely needs to come down.	O
That's our heal.	O
This is our contact bone.	O
Don't really know what those things are for.	O
I'm not going to have my guy walk so it's really not that big of a deal.	O
Let's look on top of Seven and that looks good.	O
Alright, so it looks like everything, generally speaking, is in place.	O
Alright, so theoretically speaking, we're good.	O
The only thing that I'm wondering, though, is that I did.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Getting parent OK make.	O
Parent make.	CHITCHAT
Parent make and then what happens?	O
Keep upset yes.	O
Alright so 'cause I deleted that so I don't know if you guys remembered but I deleted that bone so I don't necessarily know if it was going to track.	O
OK, cool, so now we have our red we have our sculpture now what we need to do is we need to go into back into object mode and we need to select these two and we need to parent with automatic weights.	O
Now as soon as we do that if I did it right it would give us a pose.	O

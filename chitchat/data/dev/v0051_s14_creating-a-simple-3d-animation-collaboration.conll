An rotating X is like back and forward.	O
So isn't that cool, so now I don't have to.	O
So now.	CHITCHAT
It's really rad.	CHITCHAT
And then there's my person.	O
So now you can.	CHITCHAT
But The thing is, is that you can still see the bones through him.	O
I really don't like his nose, guys.	O
I think I might like quite literally take his nose away and his heads way too long, which I think is what Pascal was getting out.	O
But like was really nice.	CHITCHAT
And saying that it just looks like in head on Easter Island even though we all know that the heads on Easter Island or like super long.	O
So yeah, so but the cool thing is.	CHITCHAT
If I push F 12 to render granted.	O
I don't think I don't think there's going to be.	O
There's no light.	O
I have not yet put a light in there, so I rendered it black.	O
Cool 'cause you know.	CHITCHAT
The absence of light.	O
Create the black scene.	O
That's why we have night time.	O
OK, so I need a light.	O

Set your name or you just clever is that is that was going on.	O
Um, Alright Christian says that I need to put in a Dome light.	O
OK, so, so here's what we're going to do is we're gonna go back to Arsene Wow guys.	O
He's huge atias if I go to my camera angle.	O
This is literally all I see.	O
That's really funny.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, let's see what the animation would look like.	O
If we kept him this big just for giggles.	O
So go play.	O
Because he's not even standing on the plane.	O
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
That's what we would see, alright, cool.	O
So let's not do that.	O
All right, so we we need to make our Bud alot smaller.	O
So let's go ahead and make her Bud a lot smaller.	O
Of Fudge, but it what is happening right now?	O
Uh, we're in pose mode.	O
That's what's happening.	CHITCHAT
Let's get in object mode.	O
Cool, let's make him smaller.	O
You All right?	CHITCHAT
And let's let's move him down.	O
To the plane.	O
So he needs to go.	O
Down to the floor.	O
He has like one arm sticking out, so we're definitely going to need to like fix that.	O
But let's go ahead and do our zero, so that's where he's at, and let's go ahead and add a light xiaoyi.	O
We kind of need that.	O
So let's let's break out of camera view by hitting zero.	O
I'm going to shift a.	O
We're going to hit.	CHITCHAT
We're going to add a light I just really.	O
I like the sun so if you guys.	O

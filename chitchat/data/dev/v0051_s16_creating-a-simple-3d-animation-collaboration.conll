Now this shadow was like at a three.	O
So what happens is that you can see that adds origin point, which is where the feed our.	O
It's short.	O
But then at that point it does get softer.	O
And so you can see here this is a 13, so you can.	O
Still it still kind of sharp.	O
But then at the same time it gets.	O
It gets really really really soft.	O
Alright, so I'm going to like kind of zoom in here.	O
And I'm looking at currently at like render mode.	O
Which is why things are kind of like getting kind of crazy, and so I'm just wondering like what is happening to get the shadows.	O
Like that I wonder.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what's going on, but you can tell that in this I'm going to go ahead and move my camera actually down to like over here.	O
I'm gonna click 0 just to see what is in my camera.	O
All right, so that would be so I'm going to go ahead and render that 'cause I'm really interested to see.	O
What's happening, oh, I really zoomed in.	O
OK, yeah, so there's just some shading happening.	O
It's just really dark right there, but that's fine.	O
All right, but you guys can see here really closely, which is nice that even though here you can see.	O
The skeleton, the skeleton through it, you don't see it on your character, which is really nice.	O
All right, but our character is kind of Nikki.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We kind of got to figure out what we're going to do about that, um.	O
And this our character, all of our characters kind of had like, well, look like clothes on.	O
But at the same time, they also didn't have arms.	O
They had this sign and they had a floating head.	O
I didn't really mind the floating head so much, but I didn't really like what ended up happening with some of the shadows it created.	O
Like these really harsh like linear lights or linear shadows, and I just thought it kind of really made things murky, so I don't necessarily want to do the signs, but at the same time I feel like the signs are kind of important, so I'm kind of like still kind of trying to figure out what all to do with that.	O
All right, so let's go ahead and make this.	O
500 I feel like it needs to be brighter.	O
Alright, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and make this plane.	O
Asayan And then this person.	O
Eh?	CHITCHAT
Dark Green I don't know.	O
I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Let's move our camera.	O
Just to see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's do that.	CHITCHAT
Well, I really need to fix his Arm 'cause he looks like he might be doing something inappropriate.	O
Let's see and let's go ahead and F-12 that real quick.	O
I think we're going to need to do a little bit of a light, a front light 'cause right now there's only one light which is beautiful.	O
But it definitely cannot like filling in their features.	O
So I'm going to add an extra light, but we can go ahead and get out of this perspective.	O
Alright, so one of the questions that I had 'cause I never really got to never got to wonder this or under this.	O
Is I can select tab and I can fix this guys poor face.	O
Alright, come on, I'm trying to like move him sideways and he's not.	O
He's not moving him sideways.	O
Oh my goodness.	CHITCHAT
OK, So what I want to do is I just I wonder if I can smooth out his whole knows.	O
Let's just select this whole thing.	O
Uh, let's do.	CHITCHAT
Let's do vertices.	O
Let's select all of these around here.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
I so like your face better when you don't have a nose.	O
Sorry dude, love you.	CHITCHAT
You're not getting a nose for me.	O

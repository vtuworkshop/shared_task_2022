OK, so there you go.	CHITCHAT
Alright guys, so I'm going to go ahead and take a break because I want to share something that's really cool.	CHITCHAT
And if you guys want to join your more than welcome.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I do have a discord.	CHITCHAT
It is for oops, hey, you're Super Duper.	CHITCHAT
It is for all of those people who love to make things so.	CHITCHAT
Generally speaking, this is a crafter makers place because I am a paper illustrator and that is what I do primarily.	CHITCHAT
So whenever I do use 3D, it's normally to create paper templates in order to then photograph them.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have looked at my big hands or my Instagram or my Twitter, you guys probably already have caught on, but there we do have a 3D chat and here so specifically blender, but we also have some CD for enthusiasts as well.	CHITCHAT
And that's where we just kind of talk about all things 3D.	CHITCHAT
But also, if you guys are interested in inspiration, so again, this is paper made.	CHITCHAT
Would a paper from someone in our discord channel and then also Austin was in here as well.	CHITCHAT
From our discord channel.	CHITCHAT
So I post inspiration every single day we can give feedback to each other.	CHITCHAT
I generally share a lot of colors that I like.	CHITCHAT
Most times they have pink in them as well.	CHITCHAT
And then I also let you guys know what I'm going live and then of course, if there is just how to tips and all that good stuff.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, it's nice, friendly place.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go and hit that invite link.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to copy it over and when I go ahead and share it into the chat.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys are interested in joining, we would love for you guys to continue the conversation.	CHITCHAT
But at the same time, yet don't have to.	CHITCHAT

Rotate up.	O
We need him.	O
To write wow.	O
I I'm kind of bummed.	CHITCHAT
I think he does need a sign.	O
Alright, he just looks like he's in a something.	O
Alright, let's go ahead and we're going to move him.	O
Alright, let's see, let's see.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's move you back or women it.	O
Can we move you back?	CHITCHAT
What's happening here?	CHITCHAT
Oh no, that's not deal with that with your need that you'd break it, honey.	O
All right, he looks like he's kind of walking.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So let's get rid of that view.	O
Let's go to camera view.	O
Let's change the camera, let's see.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
He looks like he's running.	O
I like it alright of 12 let's see what happens.	O
Oh look at our cutie guy.	O
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
His little area there should not be that color.	O
Alright, you know what?	CHITCHAT
Though we're learning, I'm liking it.	O
I don't know what's happening with his thumb.	O
I guess he's doing like this.	O
His his hand really should be like that.	O
Or maybe it should be more front.	O
Alright, but I'm liking it alright, so we have.	O
We have one person who is completely uhm.	O
Red, granted, we're going to have to work on his pose, but that's OK.	O
He's rigged, and that's really good.	O
So what I want to do now is that I'm going to actually get out of rendering 'cause this takes a lot of power for the computer, and we don't necessarily need that, and there's a lot of things that we're going to have to clean up with, like clothes and Whatnot, but we're just going to go ahead and just.	O
It's fine.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're going to name this person.	O
Person one I'm going to shift D.	O
Not actually overhear shift D to the wide.	O
OK, I actually got to select you come on come on.	O
Oh, I'm in pose mode.	O
Object mode there we go, select you Shifty Y.	O
Wow, what is happening to your poor arms wow.	O
Is it just is it trying to use the same?	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think can I don't can I delete that?	O
Am I going to have to re bone it?	O
I'm going to three, that's fine.	O
That's fine, let's just go ahead can.	O
I can't remove those, can I?	O
This is all new to me.	O
Yeah, so those are all my vertex groups to arm all that good stuff and I think it's trying to still like copy.	O
What's happening here?	CHITCHAT
So that kind of stinks.	CHITCHAT
Dagnab it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so can I actually just.	O
Just moving, just select the person I can't, can I?	O
OK did does that mean I'm going to have to make another person from scratch?	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
What did I do to this person's pelvis area?	O
I just shows you that I don't really know what I'm doing like the basic anatomy of a person.	O
I mean, the back looks OK.	O
And his shoulder blades look at that.	O
I actually got a shoulder blades but other things look a little scary.	O
All right, but that's what we have.	O

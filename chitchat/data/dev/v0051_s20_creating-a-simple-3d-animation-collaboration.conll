OK, so I guess I'm going to have to make another person, but that doesn't sound very fun right now, especially since we only have 15 minutes left.	O
OK, so let me go ahead and just bring the camera back to me.	O
Let me show you guys.	CHITCHAT
This is what's going to happen.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so this is an on going project and I pretty much have shared as much as I think that would be interesting to share.	O
Everything else is just really going to be me grinding, so unfortunately we're not finishing the project today, nor will I be finishing this project.	O
One stream at all, so I just wanted to kind of share the funder parts of this.	O
I'm going to go ahead an like fix it.	O
Christian said, maybe grab it from the anchor.	O
That's actually a really good.	CHITCHAT
That's that's a really good point.	O
Uh, I'm sure that would work.	O
I don't necessarily understand the anchor part.	O
I know that there has to be an anchor, and I'm thinking it might be the origin, but I really don't know and that kind of shows you friends.	O
So you might be working on something for Alex.	O
I've been in bland blender for about 2 months and I still am learning so much about it.	O
The good news now is that I understand the jargon so I can search more easily as to what I'm looking for.	O
If you guys are looking for a really quality and this is not sponsored at all, but really quality tutorials, I really enjoy CG cookie.	O
Uhm, they are also the people who bring blender market as well, which provides a platform for a lot of people to sell add-ons and a little percentage of all their sales for the most part.	O
Goes back to the organization that makes blender, which is really awesome so.	O
Something for you guys to kind of know and to be aware of a man.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, if you guys are wondering what the schedule is.	CHITCHAT
I'm here every Tuesday and Thursday between 9:00 o'clock and 11:00 also if you guys are wondering what we're going to be tackling next week, I'm actually really excited.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys have been following along, you guys know that I have been recreating Hertz tone cards, her stone as a digital playing card game made by the our friends at Blizzard who also makes Overwatch.	O
Also Diablo Hertz tone, though is really interesting is that it has a card set system and so every card on the front has the mechanics and mechanics and also tactics of the game.	O
But the back has the artwork and there's 150 different facts, and so there's a lot of different things for us to create.	O
I already went ahead and created 2, which is really fun.	O
One is blush room and the other one is mark of a car.	O
I can actually show you guys those really quick.	O
So it hang with me as I bring that up.	O
Alright so?	CHITCHAT
That those are eggs.	CHITCHAT
I think those are eggs.	O
Those look pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Not my work, but I really like it.	O
OK, so and these are the videos.	O
Alright, so I just got done doing the market for car which is really fun so again this is a this is paper.	O
And sand and Clay Christian said, no way my roommate has a lot of those.	O
All right, and so, and this is blush room, so this is all created with foam, clay and paint.	O
And again, the making of these are all on live stream.	O
So if you guys are interested in how those went down, you guys can catch that again.	O
If you guys are wondering where you can catch the replay of anything that I've done on line, you guys can do that right here by clicking videos all right.	O
But we are going to be changing our tune.	O
I did start another card, but frankly I think I'm kind of done with her stone cards for the moment.	O
So what does Alicia want to do I want to recreate icons.	O
OK Anne, I'm talking about your iOS icons.	O
They have changed from a skew morphism too.	O
More flat design, they're getting more into 3D shapes, and So what I thought would be really cool is what if I recreated app icons out of intangible assets so I could create a really dope, you know, like application icon and then put it in a shadow box or something.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think would be really cool.	CHITCHAT
It be really small and it would also be something that I could probably do in one cast, which is what I want.	O
I don't want to have these big projects that take forecast for me to finish because I know that's really hard for you guys to follow along.	O
So again, one last time I'm going to plug my discord, let me get that.	CHITCHAT
Invite.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and the designs oh as good as it might be, you can't post the same comment twice.	CHITCHAT
Alright?	CHITCHAT
So you guys are just gonna have to scroll up.	CHITCHAT
Alright?	CHITCHAT
I know you guys probably don't want me to sing, but you got it anyway?	CHITCHAT
So Christian says the designs are so organic so your style.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, we're going to come back to this.	O
And do some more modeling, but.	O
I gotta be honest, I dabbled a little in C brush earlier today and if you joined us last night we are working on this trying to get this piece of wood up here to be an interesting shape for our for our mental and.	O
Just turn the sound of touch.	O
I mean we got somewhere OK, but then spent two minutes in Z brush and realize it looked a million times better.	O
So we're going to do that.	O
But then I want to save it and they said that it's corrupted again save.	O
So you know it's practiced.	O
Alright, never forgive me, I'm not too familiar with Z brush, so it might be a little bit.	O
Little bit of fat.	O
Slow moving to go at first.	O
Do you know the basic stuff?	O

Erythema scale the whole thing down just a little bit.	O
Did you get it?	CHITCHAT
The correct proportions actually see their side view.	O
I think we could afford to.	O
Do something like that and if it sticks out a little farther, it's not 2 bags or just going to push it into the wall.	O

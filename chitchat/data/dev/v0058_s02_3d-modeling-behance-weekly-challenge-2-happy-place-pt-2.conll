I gotta black desk.	CHITCHAT
Black keyboard, black mouse black black pants.	CHITCHAT
I can't see anything on top of anything.	CHITCHAT
It is all blending together.	CHITCHAT
The set of terrifying Marge Simpson that showed up on stream that I missed.	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness.	CHITCHAT
That was nightmarish.	CHITCHAT
Scope that.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I think you gotta go bad.	CHITCHAT
Back to the.	CHITCHAT
The way of the mouse, and Fortunately I thought I missed placing it in the same spot every time.	CHITCHAT
Ticker tape on my pen.	CHITCHAT
I need to.	CHITCHAT
It's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
Just a bright yellow strip.	CHITCHAT
I have my glasses on so you looking for any of this.	CHITCHAT
Give up.	CHITCHAT
I've been like I've been putting them in the same spot my pants.	CHITCHAT
Apparently one time I did it.	CHITCHAT
And that's all it takes.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go back to wing it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
This would be so much better with a pen low.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be nuts.	CHITCHAT
He still.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's working.	CHITCHAT
Do you think?	CHITCHAT
Give me idea.	CHITCHAT
And maybe go for a few.	CHITCHAT
Or these larger dance actually know what I liked him.	CHITCHAT
Scope for me.	CHITCHAT
Don't don't get me.	CHITCHAT
It's in the chunk taken out of here.	CHITCHAT
Then we're going to hit DMV for move.	CHITCHAT
Remember, no signal.	CHITCHAT
Short cuts here 'cause they are.	O
They do follow.	CHITCHAT
A bit of reason, so be for brush.	O
And then envy if you think about the letters that move, he got it there and then did trim dynamic, which is TD.	O
He said sorry.	CHITCHAT
Having said he's planning this program that just does not make sense to me.	CHITCHAT
I'm still like looking off to the distance at my desk, hopefully hoping that.	CHITCHAT
That panel jumped out at me, but.	O
The past, I don't think it's going to happen.	CHITCHAT
Sure.	CHITCHAT
Looked at this way.	CHITCHAT
Bring up the back so I'm going to be covered up anyways.	O
If it's flat, that's OK, might do.	O
Animal I said We don't really know what we're doing here.	O
You're gonna rotate this just.	O

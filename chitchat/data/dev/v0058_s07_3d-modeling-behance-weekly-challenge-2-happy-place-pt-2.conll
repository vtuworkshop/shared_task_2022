After hours of dealing with stockers and Wesson us too.	CHITCHAT
How's it going, Dave?	CHITCHAT
Farsi, I'm glad you're here.	CHITCHAT
I want to show you something.	CHITCHAT
We're going to have a little sidebar.	O
Dave, staying here in fact.	CHITCHAT
Let me pull up something real quick.	O
I'm just going to switch over, will be right back.	CHITCHAT
OK, OK, we're back.	CHITCHAT
Last stream.	CHITCHAT
Dave was here.	CHITCHAT
He was talking about.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh playing gloomhaven.	CHITCHAT
On tabletop simulator and I wanted to show.	O
To little pieces that I text you 'cause.	O
This year Also I saw.	CHITCHAT
Now you said hard world eggs.	CHITCHAT
He is totally lost me I.	CHITCHAT
I'm just I'm out the window.	CHITCHAT
Hard boiled eggs in a calzone and you make fun of me for pineapple on pizza.	CHITCHAT
You have hard boiled eggs.	CHITCHAT
My goodness.	CHITCHAT
Here we go alright.	O
So they aren't like the most detailed little textures, but there were a fun little project because so.	O
I think they were 3D scans of the little figuring, so I have to do a bit of cleanup and some work.	O
But I tried to call this is the guy who played little crack heart.	O
I got him textured.	O
I remember how many there were.	O
I know I did, text them all.	O
Only textured ones were playing though.	O
This one.	O
This is a lot of fun.	O
Sleep is kind of.	O
More stylized than what I typically do.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, we got two other ones.	O
We got the tinkerer.	O
It is a while ago this probably.	O
You're gonna hafta two years at this point, if not longer.	O
Never heard of eggs in Kansas yet?	CHITCHAT
Neither have I have totally lost me.	CHITCHAT
I'm just so thrown off that.	CHITCHAT
He says the Tinker and then finally we got the.	O
The scandal?	O
Well, try not to get too close because.	O
It's not the cleanest, but you know.	O
You do what you work with, so that was my.	O
Little foray into.	O
Messing around making some.	O
Smoke textures that it is fun little project.	O
It's kind of like minifig painting without having not paint, which is always nice.	O
It's probably no.	O
I need to eat like a bear.	CHITCHAT
Don't judge me for half past the half at least three or four plates.	CHITCHAT
Can you just open the existing 3D models of substance into?	O
Well, yeah, I think there is like if I recall, it's been so long I'm pretty sure it to do a little bit of cleanup.	O
Hum, I think there may have holes in the mesh and some funny parts because they were scans.	O
So if I recall, I clean them up and then sent them over to painter and just yeah just paying them.	O
You see, I'm not so sure if I did clean him up at this point, 'cause I think all I did was add the textures.	O
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
I've been told you that he works out like Arnie, so I eat so much.	CHITCHAT

So I did that one just to add some more contrast here.	O
And then I also added a color balance one.	O
So here we did, um.	CHITCHAT
You can pull up your adjustments that not that one.	O
This one so.	O
You have your adjustment layers over here and if you click on different ones you can see the properties.	O
So this is what I added to this and I can go back and I can change it anytime I can change it now or I wanted to, but I think it's like good where it is.	O
So I think that's you know.	CHITCHAT
Like I I I knew that you know adjustment layers existed.	CHITCHAT
I just don't use them very much.	CHITCHAT
I usually flatten and then edit, but I think it worked out well on this one.	O
Since you know I'm not finished with it, I have some stuff that I want to do some cleanup on and everything, and that's what we're going to work on today.	CHITCHAT
But just putting those two layers on here.	O
Before I did any of that and then painting on top of everything like I have a better color palette now.	O
So AM.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, um, but what we're going to do today is work on doing some cleanup here.	O
And doing some like rendering.	O
And I mean it's like pretty far along, so I think that's pretty much all we have to do here.	CHITCHAT
But thank you, Douglas.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to figure out.	CHITCHAT
I just want to start painting on top of stuff, or I might want to go back in here.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Where the lines are and maybe just kind of clean up a few things like I know I wanted to go back on top of her hair and add that texture in here because I block everything in with.	O
Like a lasso tool, so it's very like.	O
Hard edged and I want to add some of that texture back in here.	O
Yeah, I think I'm going to go.	CHITCHAT
Where is my line layer?	CHITCHAT
Here my lines and.	O
I am just going to go in here.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Clean up a little bit of this, oh.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
I don't have the brush their own is.	O
So I'm going to use the sketch square brush and.	O
Um, I'm going to hold down.	O
The I don't know it's called.	CHITCHAT
I feel like we go through this every time I stream, but for those who don't know, um, this little key with a little squiggle.	O
Um, if you hold that down whenever you have your brushes selected then it will erase.	O
With a brush at the same settings as you're like, Brush Alright.	O
It will erase with the eraser that is the same setting is your brush, so it's really nice if you don't need to like.	O
Swap over to your eraser.	O
And you don't want to like have to go through all the eraser settings and change those.	O
You can just.	O
Stick with your brush that you're using.	O
Plus I feel like erasing with the same brush that you were drawing with.	O
Helps keep everything consistent.	O
As far as like texture.	O
Uhm, but the bike is on a different layer.	O
So we're just going to kind of clean up.	O
Some of the lines that I don't want in here.	CHITCHAT
It's not really too much.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Sing Most of them are on her legs are here so.	O
Try to get like a sharper line.	O
The~ OK?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know how to say it.	CHITCHAT
I didn't wanna say it the Tilden.	CHITCHAT
I know it for next time.	CHITCHAT
Next stream when I explain it again.	CHITCHAT
So right before I started streaming I got.	CHITCHAT
A package in the Mail and I haven't opened it yet, but I already know what it is.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I ordered some new stickers.	CHITCHAT
From sticker app and I'm really excited to open them.	CHITCHAT
But I'm going to do like an unboxing video so I can't do it right now.	CHITCHAT

I've been waiting for them and.	CHITCHAT
I forgot they were coming today.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That was a nice little surprise.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Well, so we want to do with the lines on the bike.	O
Here are they.	CHITCHAT
Also, something I learned pretty recently.	CHITCHAT
If you hold down control and then you click.	O
On We have to have like the move tool selected.	O
But if you click.	O
You can find the layer you're looking for, like really easily.	O
This is like.	CHITCHAT
There it is.	CHITCHAT
That's very helpful.	CHITCHAT
I hate like looking through layers and trying to find like where is this little speck that I need to erase?	CHITCHAT
Probably should wear my glasses.	CHITCHAT
I like, I feel like every time I start streaming I get tired.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why that is.	CHITCHAT
I think it's like looking at the screen for awhile, just like.	CHITCHAT
Sleeping.	CHITCHAT
Even though you know I just started streaming.	CHITCHAT
And this is actually the first.	CHITCHAT
Drawing I have done today.	CHITCHAT
So I went to the post office this morning.	CHITCHAT
I had a bad time, just not pleasant.	CHITCHAT
Not a pleasant experience with post office.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Fat Kind of put me in a bad mood this morning and then had to go to the grocery store so.	CHITCHAT
Fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
But I'm glad to be back home.	CHITCHAT
You know I have.	CHITCHAT
My references on Pinterest and I forgot to pull them up.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go ahead and do that.	CHITCHAT
They found that I'm drawing a bike.	CHITCHAT
Definitely need a reference 'cause I do not know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
So this.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Drawing this bike because it's very cute.	CHITCHAT
How come?	CHITCHAT
Open right here for now.	O
Except around I'm not making the tires white, they're going to be black tires.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So as far as the lines go right here, I don't think.	O
I can really do too much too.	O
Prove that.	CHITCHAT
'cause we're just going to pay on top of it so it's OK.	O
Uhm, I think what I'll do is start out.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Before I start painting, I'm actually going to add a few.	O
Adjustment layers.	O
Um are like blending layers.	O
So we're going to do.	CHITCHAT
Some shadows in here.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to add some like dappled lighting.	O
But how about later?	CHITCHAT
So we're just going to start out with like a multiply.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I think what I'm going to do is actually erase.	O
Out some highlights.	O
So we're just going to try to find A.	O

Kind of like a purple tone to contrast with, like the lighting that I'm going to have.	O
I'm just going to like put this over top of the entire illustration and areas out.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Hi, thank you Anthony.	CHITCHAT
Uh, yes.	CHITCHAT
I hate drawing bicycles too.	CHITCHAT
I think this is the first bike I have drawn since.	CHITCHAT
Uh, probably high school, so um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah Oh Hi Rachel.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, um.	CHITCHAT
So these up.	CHITCHAT
So this is for the printing sticker club on my Patris on an once we finish this I will I order my prints from cat print now for the print Super Club is it just makes it easier so I don't have to like print them all individually.	CHITCHAT
I can just make the order and then be done with it.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I'll get like the proofs and for those, and then I will get up.	CHITCHAT
So if I approve the proof.	CHITCHAT
Then they'll send me in the.	CHITCHAT
Like Finals And like all the proofs on cat print are free, so that's like really nice.	CHITCHAT
I use them for like all my printing stuff.	CHITCHAT
So since I put this like.	O
On top Like this, a multiply layer on top.	O
I'm just going to kind of erase.	O
Out what would be in.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Or like what would be.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
A highlight.	O
I'm just kind of coming here and doing that like for the background part right now.	O
So obviously the Sky is not going to have any shadows on it.	O
Um, so erase all that.	O
I saw grass over here.	O
And then when I kind of erase.	O
Almost like a.	O
And glow.	O
Playing song glow, but it's like the light is kind of like spilling over.	CHITCHAT
Right here, so it's a really subtle.	CHITCHAT
Highlight.	O
I haven't exactly decided.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Where I went on my lighting to go yet.	CHITCHAT
'cause I want her face to be like the focal point, so I don't want to completely.	O
And shadow.	O
So I think maybe some.	CHITCHAT
Some federal highlights in here.	O
Nothing like super bright like this.	O
I'm in the background, but.	O
Add a little bit.	O
On her face.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Will play around with some more intense highlights here in a little bit.	O
The only bad thing about wearing glasses like I need to see the color and these are like blue light glasses.	CHITCHAT
Um, so the colours aren't super accurate.	CHITCHAT
It's like.	CHITCHAT
Slightly yellow.	CHITCHAT
Are you still shade like all of my illustrations like this?	CHITCHAT
For awhile, probably like in high school and then I stopped doing it.	CHITCHAT
Uhm where I erased out highlights and then more recently I've got back into it.	CHITCHAT
Not really sure why I stopped.	CHITCHAT

But I'm having more fun with it this way.	CHITCHAT
Because using like these blending modes like this is a multiply layer like I don't have to think about.	O
The color as much like I already have my basic like my um, basic colours down.	O
And when I put the multiply layer on it, it adds this like.	O
So this is what it looks like.	O
Without the multiply layer, so is this really light purple?	O
And then you make it multiply?	O
It just adds a good contrast to him.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Which I can even go back and I can.	O
I can change color of.	O
The UM?	CHITCHAT
Shadows if I want to.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Just like make him really right, go crazy with the color.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Which Valley right here for now and you know, I can always tone it down if I want to, but for now, we're just going to keep it.	O
Like this and then, um?	CHITCHAT
We can make those adjustments.	O
Later on.	O
But after we lay down these shadows.	O
And you know, do do another blending mode with some highlights in here.	O
What I'll do is I'll paint on top of everything.	O
And you know, sometimes I actually like.	CHITCHAT
Do the shadows and stuff after I do the clean up.	O
Then sometimes I do the.	CHITCHAT
And I've certainly the shadows first like this.	CHITCHAT
But I think it just kind of depends on you know how I'm feeling and how like how I want to approach it.	CHITCHAT
Because when you're doing it this way, you're adding like.	O
Different color tones in here that you can pick from whenever you are.	O
Um, picking colors later.	O
To clean everything up and render it.	O
Such as kind of depends on what you want to do.	CHITCHAT
And really, I could just add this stuff in and then I could hide.	O
This and then go in and render it and then come back and this will be here.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Well, it's like there's so many different ways you can work.	CHITCHAT
When you're doing like a digital painting.	CHITCHAT
I think that's like really cool about it, but.	CHITCHAT
I know it can be a little daunting when you're first starting out.	CHITCHAT
You don't really know like what is the right way to do this is like.	CHITCHAT
I mean.	CHITCHAT
You can try a bunch of different ways and then you figure out which one is the best one for you.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just adding the this phone.	O
Taking away the shadows, but I'm doing it very, very lightly.	O
Just to make it a little bit more subtle.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Anything that's like more intense, I'll add it.	O
When I do my rendering.	CHITCHAT
So just adding that like really subtle.	CHITCHAT
These shadows little bit.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just added so much contrast here.	O
It's not done yet, but.	CHITCHAT
It's like a good start and it helps you kind of see like where you want your.	CHITCHAT
Waiting to go.	CHITCHAT
And it's also a good way to test out different lighting situations.	CHITCHAT
If you're like unsure.	CHITCHAT

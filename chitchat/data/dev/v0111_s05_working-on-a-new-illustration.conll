How you want everything to come?	CHITCHAT
To be like in the end, you can just kind of do this.	CHITCHAT
Try a bunch of different ways and.	CHITCHAT
Um, just quickly change it if you want.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I am kind of looking at this now and I.	CHITCHAT
I think I might want to go back and.	CHITCHAT
Do the clean up first.	O
So I'll just keep this here and then.	O
Just make a new layer.	O
Zoom in here.	O
And this ad.	O
Some texture to her hair.	O
I think we'll do that first.	CHITCHAT
I tend to like bounce around him, work on a bunch of different things.	CHITCHAT
Shoe, I don't remember exactly which brush I used.	CHITCHAT
When I did the illustration on the left.	CHITCHAT
I think it was on another pencil brushes here.	CHITCHAT
Probably not this one.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if we're just going to play around it and see how it goes, but I also do need to add some like darker tones in her hair.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I kind of lost the contrast in here.	O
Oh, but before I do anything else, I am going to add my value check layer.	O
So that is where you fill a new layer like on top of everything.	O
You fill it with white.	O
And then you change the blending mode to color.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I can just kind of like check.	CHITCHAT
How everything's going up and right now I'm seeing that.	CHITCHAT
The color that I made the lines on her arm.	O
They had a little bit too much contrast.	O
Compared to her skin tone, so I think I might.	O
A white and this line up a little bit just because it's like you look at the rest of the materials here.	O
And there's not as much contrast in between, AH, the line and the colour like, especially down here on the bike.	O
Like everything is kind of like cohesive like that, but.	CHITCHAT
You know this this area, this area I guess on her legs to really the only part that's not the same.	O
So this kind of helps me like this value check layer helps me see that.	O
Um, 'cause I did like when I was looking at it like this.	O
It was like something looks a little bit off.	O
And not as cohesive him, it was the color that I chose right here.	O
Put these lines.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then I'm also seeing that right here.	CHITCHAT
Right here.	CHITCHAT
This town in this tone are very similar.	O
In value and we want this bike to stand out more.	O
So what we can do is go back down.	O
To like yes.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Trying to find the lines for the bike.	O
Are there?	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to paint on top of this clipping mask.	O
I mean on the bike.	O
But if you go to your eyedropper tool an you can do sample current layer.	O
So instead of picking up this black and white and picking up all of the colors.	O
On the bike.	O
Where?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We want to do current layer in the one below it, 'cause this is the colour of.	O
The bike, so I want to add some more of this color.	O
Like right here.	CHITCHAT
All right here.	CHITCHAT
Turn.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so something like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm probably should add.	CHITCHAT
Are you so other brush?	CHITCHAT
Because it's.	CHITCHAT
Not really the one I wanted to use on here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but I find doing this really helps.	O
Like using the value check layer.	O
'cause I can go back and look at like some of my older drawings that you know, I never even check the values and I can tell like.	O

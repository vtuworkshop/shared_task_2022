Um?	CHITCHAT
The way that I painted them.	O
With just with color and not paying attention to a contrast as much.	O
I can just tell that.	CHITCHAT
They just look just look a little bit off.	O
Same thing here.	O
With this little bike handle, I think we could.	O
You don't have to use this right now.	O
Because we know what we're looking at.	O
We just want to look at this bike.	O
Uh, the handlebars and I'm just going to.	O
Add a little bit of.	O
Highlight in here.	O
On the top.	O
So that kind of makes it stand out a little bit more.	O
I do not know why the oranges.	CHITCHAT
Are on top of the bike.	CHITCHAT
Why is that?	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, basically like that's what I do with like value, uhm, power like, make sure things are standing out.	O
Um, like you know, contrasting with each other some more, especially like working with color.	O
Think it's important.	O
There are some people they just start out and they do the entire painting in black and white and then they go back.	O
And do like overlay layers on top of a black and white painting, but I like working with color so it's just a way to keep me in check by using this.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Um, so now?	CHITCHAT
So we have that I am going to.	CHITCHAT
Do that clean up, but I said I was going to do.	O
Control.	O
Alright, so I am actually going to.	CHITCHAT
Try to color pic from maybe or not.	O
Get some of that darker tone in her hair.	O
No, I did not pick a darker tone.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Like not picking up the colors.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it is sometimes not come on.	CHITCHAT
Whatever, I will just do it manually.	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty sure this is the brush that I used.	CHITCHAT
You know, maybe these lines right here.	O
I think once I add my darker shadows in here.	O
And maybe paint on top of this little bit.	O
I think they might look a little bit more cohesive than they do right now.	O
So I'm basically what I was doing before.	CHITCHAT
He is.	CHITCHAT
Kind of blocked out.	O
They're shapes.	O
And then we went back in and we added a few.	O
No little curls.	CHITCHAT
But I'll do that.	CHITCHAT
After I get everything kind of blocked in.	CHITCHAT
We want to keep in mind like the direction of the hair and like the volume.	O
From here.	CHITCHAT
So I think I kind of talked about this when I was doing the painting on the left.	CHITCHAT
But you want to think of it as like a shape.	O
I got 3 dimensional form.	O
So it's like right here on this side I can see like it's kind of.	CHITCHAT
Doing this.	CHITCHAT
Like this is a section, this is kind of a section.	O

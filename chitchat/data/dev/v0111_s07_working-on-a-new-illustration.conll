You know?	CHITCHAT
So that would be like 3D modeling lines.	O
Um, kind of like that.	CHITCHAT
On top of it.	O
So if you think about it more like that then you kind of.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, you understand where to put the highlights.	CHITCHAT
Moraine Lake were to block in your shadows.	CHITCHAT
But right now I'm just kind of layering.	O
Up some of the color I picked.	O
Um, like a combination of this background color and the dark color that I picked.	O
When I started working on the hair.	O
So I'm going to have like.	O
A base color, and then I'm going to go back in and like punching those darks.	O
I might, I might even need to go back and erase some of these little lines in here.	O
Oh, I forgot to turn my phone volume down.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
And since we're working on top of all the other layers, I don't have to worry about.	O
Like you know, if I did something like that, just erase it.	O
I also think it's important to try to utilize your your pin pressure and just kind of like lightly.	O
Press sometimes and then you can go back in an.	O
You know, take up a color in here since it's pretty much the combination of this one and this one.	O
Uh, so you can just find new tones to add.	O
That way.	CHITCHAT
Plus a few out some of the background kind of show through.	O
I think it looks nice.	CHITCHAT
Like what you have underneath here.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, I wish I had this outfit hanging.	CHITCHAT
So cute.	CHITCHAT
So the theme for the printing secret club for this.	CHITCHAT
This illustration was called the Citrus Grove and I actually like.	CHITCHAT
I've been planning on doing this drawing for like two or three months now.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I like, I already made up the little like um, little card thing that I put on Instagram so it says like you know this one theme is whatever and it'll have like a little.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like a preview.	CHITCHAT
Of the illustration, which is not like you know, it's not like a little like cropped piece of the illustration, 'cause usually like I'll do the illustration during that month.	CHITCHAT
And Mail it out the following month so this one is going to be this ones for June, so it's going to be mailed out in July.	CHITCHAT
But I'll just post like.	CHITCHAT
A little like square thing that's got like this one had like a tree an like an orange slice on the sticker had little question marks on it, so I had already made that up like months ago 'cause.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I need.	CHITCHAT
This is kind of like what I wanted to do.	CHITCHAT
That's I've got about her back.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I can see the color a little bit better.	CHITCHAT
So I'm looking Oh my gosh, I think I lost my pin pressure.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So the darkest darks are going to be.	O
Down here like.	O

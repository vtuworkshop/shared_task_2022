OK, so I think this is.	CHITCHAT
A pretty good start.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go back and we're going to find these little scribbles.	O
Not this one.	O
OK, so we're going to come in and we're going to erase some of this using the same brush.	O
So we don't have to take all of it out.	O
So leave a little.	O
It.	CHITCHAT
I don't need to go back and add those Flowers in her hair too.	O
I don't do it now.	CHITCHAT
I will probably forget.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I think that looks better already.	CHITCHAT
Zoom out a little bit.	O
So we added so it looks closer to.	CHITCHAT
Are dumb.	CHITCHAT
Original design on the left.	O
I'm going to add a few.	O
Big uhm shadow areas.	O
I am coloring on the wrong layer.	O
Don't know where that is.	CHITCHAT
Oh the adding more lines look.	O
I'm just going to come in here and lightly, just.	O
Have like the darkest shadows.	O
Doing this like.	CHITCHAT
You know her hair is like pulled up, so you've got these kind of like lines going this way.	O
Um, up to her ponytail and I am separating that and making it more obvious that that's what's happening by adding like a darker shadow like in here and then kind of coming back out this way to show the direction of the rest of your hair.	O
I'm also thinking about shape.	O
Of the overall.	O
Peace.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, and I think here in a little bit I'll just.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably end up using.	CHITCHAT
Liquefy to pull this part down a little bit and maybe like push it in to make the shape more similar to this one so I don't want to do that right now because.	O
I just want to wait until.	CHITCHAT
I can merge this together.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Hey we got a little bit of our cleanup done.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
No, I'm not gonna do I think.	CHITCHAT
Form of an.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add a little bitty fit.	O
Highly right here.	O
I like tablet.	CHITCHAT
And here and on the top of her head.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Her earrings are actually pretty much done.	O

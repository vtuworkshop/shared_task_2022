If I added any kind of like shadows at all last time, but it doesn't really look like I did, which is odd, 'cause I normally do that.	O
Like I usually add like a little purple tone in the shadows and then go back and come.	O
Kind of play with the color a little bit that way.	O
No, that's not it.	CHITCHAT
OK, kinda like what I already have down here.	O
But basically, you know I'm putting down these colors and I'm just picking back other colors that already have down here.	O
Blending them together.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
You know, if I don't exactly love this color, I can just lightly paint on top of it.	O
So some of it shows through still, but.	O
It turns it down a little bit.	O
Then I can pick.	O
Color based on the new one that I made.	O
That might be a better shot of color.	O
So you can't like that little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Feel like there's just something off about this brush right now.	O
It's like I used this one.	O
Quite a bit and just feels a little odd to me like I'm not getting the.	O
The same blending that I want.	O
Maybe it's 'cause I'm trying to also avoid.	O
Running outside or drawing over top of the lines.	O
Even though I can erase them, I.	CHITCHAT
I'm still doing that.	CHITCHAT
Not on purpose, just out of habit.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
I don't think this.	CHITCHAT
But I added right here was necessary.	CHITCHAT
Just looks odd to me.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why this is not blending like it normally does.	O
Like this is the whole process right now.	CHITCHAT
Sing a little funky.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
I think I normally have something like 40, so that doesn't make sense.	O
Yeah, I'm just having trouble seeing on the tablet right now.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should close my window, said the lights or something.	CHITCHAT
So I can look up on the computer and I can see that it's a little bit different.	CHITCHAT
Play playlist smooth is like what it looks like on the tablet right now.	CHITCHAT
Very strange, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe just lowering the opacity alot will help.	O
Maybe I'm zoomed in too much.	O
I'm like trying to.	CHITCHAT
Get all these little little bitty details and I don't need to.	CHITCHAT
Make it more frustrating than it needs to be.	CHITCHAT

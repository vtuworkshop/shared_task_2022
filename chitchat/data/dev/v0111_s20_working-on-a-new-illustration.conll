Maybe like afraid edge with a textured brush.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
My after I work on.	O
Her legs.	O
Call dad.	CHITCHAT
Some shadows here.	O
Jason cleanup Since this little afraid part would be sitting on top.	O
Well, thank you, um.	CHITCHAT
Lately I feel like.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I feel just so uninspired to draw anything.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Terry device uhm.	CHITCHAT
Well, I.	CHITCHAT
I'm like starting to feel the same way lately.	CHITCHAT
I'm just like just really tired.	CHITCHAT
I'm just really tired all the time.	CHITCHAT
I've been so busy.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you need to take a break.	CHITCHAT
I think brakes are very beneficial as long as they're not like.	CHITCHAT
Too long, like don't take like a month off.	CHITCHAT
I know like some people.	CHITCHAT
I say that helps, but I disagree.	CHITCHAT
Every time I've taken a long break.	CHITCHAT
I've I felt like I forgot how to draw and that was miserable.	CHITCHAT
Just trying to get back into it.	CHITCHAT
So I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't take really long breaks anymore.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I might take like a week and just try not to think about drawing and then try to come back to it.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Or you could try, you know doing like challenges that you find like online like I know you know there's the character design challenge.	CHITCHAT
Or do they have like prompts and stuff?	CHITCHAT
I think it's like a monthly thing.	CHITCHAT
I personally have not done one of those, but I've done like draw this in your styles and I I love doing those.	CHITCHAT
Those are always fun.	CHITCHAT
So just maybe try doing something where it's like you don't have to really think of the concept as much like.	CHITCHAT
Just think about.	CHITCHAT
You'll be thinking more about the actual like.	CHITCHAT
Drawing.	CHITCHAT
Aspect of it, uhm?	CHITCHAT
So I think the thing that makes me.	CHITCHAT
Feel.	CHITCHAT
Burnt out is like.	CHITCHAT
Having to think about things a lot more, and if I just kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Do something where I can turn my brain off and just do like a draws in your style and just enjoy the process.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, that really helps me get back in June things.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I I do have that.	CHITCHAT
You might have seen it already, but I have like a video like how to improve your art.	CHITCHAT
On YouTube.	CHITCHAT
And I do talk about like you might be in.	CHITCHAT
You know the art improvement cycle.	CHITCHAT
Where?	CHITCHAT
You you're unhappy with your art because you are better at observing.	CHITCHAT
And critiquing your own art.	CHITCHAT
Then Um, like your ability right now.	CHITCHAT
And that's like when I get frustrated, so it's like whenever.	CHITCHAT
I can look at my drawings and like I'm like, well, I know what's wrong with it, but I don't know how to fix that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So the way to kind of get out of that is to do more studies and.	CHITCHAT
You know, try different things, I think.	CHITCHAT
But I explained everything about that, like in the video.	CHITCHAT
So that might be more helpful than me.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of rambling and trying to remember everything that I said.	CHITCHAT
Because like on the other side of that.	CHITCHAT
You know you have.	CHITCHAT
You might have those days where you're like.	CHITCHAT
Yes, everything is going so good like I drew this thing.	CHITCHAT
I really like it.	CHITCHAT
But really, like you'll probably look back on that and say, like, Oh yeah, I could do that better now.	CHITCHAT

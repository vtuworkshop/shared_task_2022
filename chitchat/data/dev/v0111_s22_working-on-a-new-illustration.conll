Yeah, but yeah, I know if you if you have your cat books turned on.	CHITCHAT
Um caps lock.	CHITCHAT
Not the right cursor.	CHITCHAT
That happened to me.	CHITCHAT
Um Oh, I'm procreate.	CHITCHAT
I think it's under the same kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
I think it's definitely under some kind of preference, I don't remember.	CHITCHAT
Plans changed it in so long.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
We got some legs now.	O
We can go paint.	O
Little fringe part of her shorts.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Which we are going to do with.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
10 Oh, maybe a fuzzy and so on.	CHITCHAT
Bring it with the fuzzy pencil.	O
And I'm just going to pick up this color.	O
I'm just painting on, you know what I already?	O
Then To give these shorts Aluma texture.	O
I'm gonna make sure we don't have them all like.	O
You know in line super perfect.	O
Because.	O
They are ripped.	O
So they wouldn't be.	O
Perfect.	O
No thanks, this part was necessary.	CHITCHAT
All right now I can go back on top of here.	O
Clean up some of those lines with the same textured brush.	O
Z.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I want to.	CHITCHAT
Take that out earlier.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad I found it on here and I kind of remember where it is an appropriate to uhm.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully you found it.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yes, we will be working on a background, so don't worry, I will.	O
Try to come.	O
Explain that as I go, you know backgrounds aren't my.	O
Focus really, uhm?	O
And it's hard to explain how to do a background without this, like doing it.	CHITCHAT
Like I'm more like I know.	CHITCHAT
More broadly, painting like portraits and characters and stuff rather than backgrounds.	CHITCHAT
I did do backgrounds for my thesis and college just because that was the whole point is like take something you don't normally draw.	CHITCHAT
And try to learn how to draw it better.	CHITCHAT
I know.	CHITCHAT
That was a challenge I put on myself.	CHITCHAT
They didn't make me do it, but that's what I picked.	CHITCHAT
And as far as backgrounds, you want to make them.	O
Less detail than your main subject.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But before we do get to the background, I am going to paint this little white girl quick trying to make it look decent.	O
Probably added.	CHITCHAT
Today so far.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to group that and so we can.	O
Take a peek and see if I like it.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Make another layer, just pick up.	O

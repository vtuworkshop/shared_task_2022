Talk rush again.	CHITCHAT
How to block this in kind of quickly 'cause I don't really want to work on the bike.	O
We want to have that same kind of painterly style as everything else.	O
I don't want to like overly render it.	O
But for this bike, I'm definitely going to add some.	O
Highlights with I mean shadows with a multiply layer that will add here in a minute.	O
Doing stuff like this doesn't hurt either.	CHITCHAT
So here I'm just kind of like making my lines like a little bit more clear.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
So I need to pull up the picture.	O
Be.	CHITCHAT
Here is the bike that I'm looking at.	O
Hum, I don't know what the back was like.	O
I think I just made this up.	CHITCHAT
Microsoft, the Little Reflector Thingy.	CHITCHAT
So it needs a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
Bread, but I don't want to make it too bright.	CHITCHAT
That's OK, I don't mind this color.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it is a little distracting, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Do you have to go to art school to work as an artist?	CHITCHAT
I don't think you do.	CHITCHAT
But Um?	CHITCHAT
You definitely need.	CHITCHAT
The skills to make a.	CHITCHAT
Like to make good art that people will want.	CHITCHAT
To either buy or wants you to make for them.	CHITCHAT
Or to like build a strong portfolio so it's like.	CHITCHAT
You know it doesn't really matter where you get those skills from, as long as you get the skills you know.	CHITCHAT
So I mean, I did go to college for art, but I was not taught.	CHITCHAT
Any digital art in college?	CHITCHAT
Or I was not taught any digital art in a school setting at all.	CHITCHAT
'cause it wasn't offered like where I live.	CHITCHAT
So all of my.	CHITCHAT
Learning as far as digital art goes was.	CHITCHAT
Come on my own time.	CHITCHAT
And just, you know, trying different things out or like if.	CHITCHAT
I was, you know, working on something and.	CHITCHAT
I was having trouble with it.	CHITCHAT
I would just say like just go to Google and be like How do I do this?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm uh, actually have a video coming out.	CHITCHAT
Um in August.	CHITCHAT
About like that part of my art journey 'cause I just released a video on YouTube talking about like.	CHITCHAT
Why I started doing art and um?	CHITCHAT
My, uh, it's kind of like.	CHITCHAT
My our journey and high school and um, like I talked about.	CHITCHAT
Going to ringling for pre college?	CHITCHAT
And that whole experience.	CHITCHAT
But I I made two parts, so the second part is about like.	CHITCHAT
My experience in college and then.	CHITCHAT
Um my.	CHITCHAT
Like how I started doing freelance.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That's like coming out in August.	CHITCHAT
But I actually have that on Patris on right now for those.	CHITCHAT
Patrons.	CHITCHAT
That support me in the YouTube here.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but it's just because I get their credits for that video and it wasn't supposed to be 2 parts and then it ended up being a lot longer of a video that I thought it was going to be.	CHITCHAT
So I was like, well, we're going to split it up and.	CHITCHAT
I want to put like a 30 minute video on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
So, like in August, still have there.	CHITCHAT

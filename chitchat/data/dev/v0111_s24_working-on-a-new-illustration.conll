Credits for that video, but I'm taking like a break, this one from Patrion to focus on some other things.	CHITCHAT
And Uhm.	CHITCHAT
That's why it's like coming out in August instead of July.	CHITCHAT
I like.	CHITCHAT
And you talk about them.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much what I just said about like do I think you need to go to art school 'cause I mean I did go to art school I mean it wasn't like art school or school like, you know, like Ringling or like Christy or something.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Because it was just like a local University that had an art program.	CHITCHAT
But I'm still like, you know, I didn't learn from like a classroom like how to draw.	CHITCHAT
Like this?	CHITCHAT
I learn more traditional like how to do like proper anatomy and like how to.	CHITCHAT
Paint on.	CHITCHAT
A canvas with oil paints.	CHITCHAT
Kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
So it was like it was different, but I still like learned stuff that I could apply.	CHITCHAT
To this.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, um.	CHITCHAT
Are drawing from mood boards considered plagiarism?	CHITCHAT
I don't think so.	CHITCHAT
Um, as long as like you don't want to draw like.	CHITCHAT
Exactly the person that you see.	CHITCHAT
Like if I.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, I'll pull up.	CHITCHAT
A mood more that I made.	CHITCHAT
Because I did do like a mood board challenge thing.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I think you know if you hear something like moodboards underpinned.	CHITCHAT
If I did so I did make a character out of this mood board, but it's like I just threw her in this outfit and I gave her some Flowers and a bag of like that's not.	CHITCHAT
The thought of copying anything looks like you're making a character inspired by that.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I have a sticker that I meet her.	CHITCHAT
Actually.	CHITCHAT
See.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can totally see it's like the same shirt.	CHITCHAT
So she's got a bag in the Flowers.	CHITCHAT
But like it can be inspired by that.	CHITCHAT
I mean really.	CHITCHAT
I don't know where I heard this, but it's like once an article of clothing is made then it's like.	CHITCHAT
You can just make the same articles, clothing and it's like not plagiarizing it, uhm?	CHITCHAT
But if it's if it's still a design, it's not made yet, then you can't plagiarize the design.	CHITCHAT
In that stage.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, it's weird, I don't know where I heard that from, or if it's even correct, so.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I mean this isn't any kind of like crazy outfit, but.	CHITCHAT
Would have to be thought about alot.	CHITCHAT
It's like I wear stuff like that, um?	CHITCHAT
But I mean even stuff like this.	CHITCHAT
I think I did a mood board, kind of like this.	CHITCHAT
And you know, I didn't draw this girl, but I think I drew her hair similarly.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
But I wouldn't be going in and like.	CHITCHAT
If I say I.	CHITCHAT
Made a mood board and I.	CHITCHAT
Person that.	CHITCHAT
Like they made a mood board and it was like this girl was on my mood board an I drew this exact same picture an I sold it like I don't think that would be OK.	CHITCHAT
But you can be inspired by maybe her pose, just like laying down in some leaves.	CHITCHAT
You don't have to draw her, uh, so just switch it up enough to wear it.	CHITCHAT
Not the exact same thing.	CHITCHAT
I would say.	CHITCHAT
I get back to move forward that I was looking at.	CHITCHAT
For my Pinterest Board hears like this is basically my mood board for this, it's like.	CHITCHAT
Like I use this pose.	CHITCHAT
For this.	CHITCHAT
But like.	CHITCHAT
Come back.	CHITCHAT
But it's like I needed a pose reference.	CHITCHAT
So that's what I found was like this works.	CHITCHAT
This is the idea I had in my head, but I mean, you know I've got oranges and stuff and it's not like I'm drawing this.	CHITCHAT
For this, it's like the whole like feeling of it.	CHITCHAT

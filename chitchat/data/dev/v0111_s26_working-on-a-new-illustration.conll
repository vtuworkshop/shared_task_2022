This like kind of painterly brush.	O
And see how that goes going to do something like lines like this.	O
Like very kind of like layered and choppy looking.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I'm kind of like in between.	CHITCHAT
Files like.	CHITCHAT
I am kind of looking at different directions to take my art style an adult.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing a lot of like experimenting with different brushes and stuff right now is like this fresh that I'm using right now is like the one that I always used to use for everything no matter what it was.	CHITCHAT
And you know, I was trying to get away from that, but then sometimes I look at my old art and I'm like why do I like this better?	CHITCHAT
Looks sad.	CHITCHAT
So I'm like trying to figure out how I wanted.	CHITCHAT
I want to like paint things in the future.	CHITCHAT
I guess not everything has to be like the same all the time I can switch it up, but I don't know which ones.	CHITCHAT
My favorite way to paint anymore.	CHITCHAT
Same for awhile there.	CHITCHAT
I was trying a lot of like really textured brushes.	O
On characters.	O
Like I did.	CHITCHAT
One uhm.	CHITCHAT
Actually another sticker.	CHITCHAT
I think it's on my wall.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you can see it, but it's like a fairy.	CHITCHAT
It was one of my drawers in your style challenges on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
But if you like, look closely at the lines on that one.	CHITCHAT
It's a lot more textured than what I would normally use and.	CHITCHAT
I like how it turned out, but it was difficult to.	CHITCHAT
Try to capture that look 'cause I'm not used to drawing that way.	CHITCHAT
Thing being more precise, like I like to be messy whenever I paint.	CHITCHAT
So maybe that's just not for me, even though I like the way it looks when other people do it.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's just not.	CHITCHAT
How my stylus supposed to be?	CHITCHAT
'cause it should be something that comes naturally.	CHITCHAT
Well, you enjoy doing and I didn't really enjoy doing that.	CHITCHAT
You know, I like how it turned out.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Very frustrating.	CHITCHAT
Took longer than I thought it would.	CHITCHAT
That's why I paint like this rather than.	O
You know, going in and doing super clean lines.	O
In the first place, 'cause I like painting over stuff.	O
I like sculpting.	CHITCHAT
The colors on the here.	O
Coming back and admin those lines.	O
Paint over the whole thing.	O
Just change the color a little bit.	O
That's what I like to do.	CHITCHAT
How old do you have to be to make and sell art?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I don't know how old you have to be.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, you might need to look that up like.	CHITCHAT
On line somewhere.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I didn't start selling art.	CHITCHAT
Until I was.	CHITCHAT
What year was it like 2017 or 2018?	CHITCHAT
I think so.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how old I was like 20.	CHITCHAT

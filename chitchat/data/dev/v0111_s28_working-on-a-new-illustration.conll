Quite could improve the peace.	CHITCHAT
But that would also be like for one of my patrion tears, probably the one the $10 here where people get their YouTube credits.	CHITCHAT
Channel Come on dude.	CHITCHAT
That's annoying, I can.	CHITCHAT
I can make him leave.	CHITCHAT
She's just pretty feisty.	CHITCHAT
I don't think he'll stop anytime soon.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I, I mean, I thought that would be like an interesting YouTube video and it would also help people.	CHITCHAT
Um, I've seen some other like artists on YouTube doing that.	CHITCHAT
How do I know that's kind of cool?	CHITCHAT
That's interesting to watch, because really, it's like you can apply.	CHITCHAT
Other people's critiques to your own art sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Whenever I I took some classes on school ISM.	CHITCHAT
And they like they have a directed course where you have, like your instructor, who will critique your work and give you feedback and stuff.	CHITCHAT
But like if you take the.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't know what it's called, it's just like you get the videos and like the lessons you get, like the critiques from other people too.	CHITCHAT
And that's like really helpful just to watch those.	CHITCHAT
So then you kind of understand, like, oh, this is.	CHITCHAT
This is what they're looking for.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think that would be.	CHITCHAT
Pretty cool to do, it wouldn't be this month, but.	CHITCHAT
Mrs patreons like on pause right now.	CHITCHAT
But I might do that.	CHITCHAT
In July or no, no no.	CHITCHAT
It's July now I won't do it in August because I already have a video for August, so we might do that in September.	CHITCHAT
I don't know 'cause I have to figure out like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, well logistics of everything like.	CHITCHAT
But what if I get too many people wanting one and?	CHITCHAT
How do I like get them all done?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't remember how many people are in that tier.	CHITCHAT
I think total look like.	CHITCHAT
80 something people.	CHITCHAT
Between the bacteria and then the other two that are above that, that would also get that benefit.	CHITCHAT
So I have to figure out, like you know how.	CHITCHAT
Do I get those all done?	CHITCHAT
If everybody wants one like I know like everybody probably won't won't once because.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
I don't know how everybody feels about having their work critiqued.	CHITCHAT
So like in a video.	CHITCHAT
And like outlook.	CHITCHAT
Out in public, you know.	CHITCHAT
Alright, wait.	CHITCHAT
Critique differently, so I don't want to like, like of course I'm not like being mean or anything like it's always very respectful critique.	CHITCHAT
Like even on discord and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Just other people.	CHITCHAT
In there were always very nice.	CHITCHAT
Not even happened here.	CHITCHAT

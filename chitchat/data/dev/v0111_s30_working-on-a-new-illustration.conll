We got some questions.	CHITCHAT
I see.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
How do you blend on digital art and how do you color a background?	O
Well, we're going to work on coloring a background in 2nd.	O
Once I finish his bike.	O
And then I'll talk about that.	CHITCHAT
But with blending, I would say to.	O
Try to lower your opacity.	O
Of your brush.	O
And really try to utilize your pen pressure.	O
Because, you know?	CHITCHAT
Like Most tablets they have.	O
Pin pressure where?	O
So you see, like this is me pressing like as lightly as I can, and you can barely see it, and this is the opacity turned all the way up and then it's like I can do this.	O
I can press harder and then it's.	O
Like that, so I mean, it's just being like really gentle with it.	O
And you can also so my flow of my brush up here is that 80.	O
If I lower it.	O
It's like less.	O
Comes out onto the canvas.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Um, so I just like I usually just press really lightly.	O
And I I keep, you know, picking up the color.	O
But I want to use.	O
Putting it down.	O
Boy, I really lost all this.	CHITCHAT
The structure of the bike here whenever I.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Start working with these lines.	O
I need to pick a color.	O
Try to create a little bit more structure here, uhm?	O
How smart are my glasses?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
This is my first time joining the chat on the cancel welcome.	CHITCHAT
Um, do you like procreate or photo shop better?	O
Um, I like them both.	O
I've been using photo shop a lot longer an I prefer using photo shop when I am.	O
Making big pieces like this.	O
But you know?	CHITCHAT
Procreate is so good for.	O
I mean, you can use it for a lot of things, but.	CHITCHAT
I like it for sketching, mostly since.	O
It's on my iPad.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
I use both so.	CHITCHAT
Right now I'm using photo shop.	O
Of what digital art pad do you recommend XP pen or who Jan?	O
So I've used both of those.	CHITCHAT
My who Jan one actually did a giveaway for it and it was very similar to the Wakeham intuos pro that I have.	O
Um, which was a tablet that I mainly used like before this one.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That one was good and then the one the other one that I got was a dumb.	O
XP pen artist.	O
Wells pro I think it was called.	O
I did a review on both of them.	CHITCHAT
They were both on my YouTube.	CHITCHAT
But I don't really know like which one.	CHITCHAT
I would prefer out of the two brands necessarily because they were very different tablets like that one did not have a screen and the other one did.	CHITCHAT
So I think.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of A.	CHITCHAT
Different in that way, so I can't really say like which one I like better.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I will say that what the XP pen I did get a little frustrated with the.	CHITCHAT
What was that like connection issues?	CHITCHAT
It was the display one.	CHITCHAT
But it wouldn't like keep my settings that reflect the settings would reset every time my chapter my computer would turn off.	CHITCHAT
Close, frustrating.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it was something on my end or not and it didn't.	CHITCHAT
That wasn't happening when I did the review.	CHITCHAT
It happened later on.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't like this like, uhm.	CHITCHAT

We have this that we cleaned up.	O
And now we're going to go into the background.	O
I'm going to go all the way.	O
Down here.	O
Pointless line here, alright so.	O
I'm just going to put my background.	O
Here in a group and.	O
The rest of the character in a group I know she's already in a group, cool.	O
Um, I'm going to make a new layer in between.	O
The background and the character.	O
That's going to be the clean up for the background.	O
And So what I'm going to start out with is.	O
I'm gonna.	CHITCHAT
So I have all this kind of like blocked out.	O
I guess I can show you guys like.	CHITCHAT
So this is like what I drew.	O
This is my sketch and then I like.	O
Set it to multiply an I layered it.	O
Like layered colors on top of each other with the multiply on top of that.	O
Um, so now I'm just going to paint over the whole thing.	O
We're going to start in the foreground with a.	O
Textured brush I think I'm going to do, um.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
Sharp render maybe?	O
Trying to get something that would be like nice, untextured for like dirt.	O
Um will be flat painting.	O
I think we're going to go with this one.	O
It's a flat painting brush, uhm?	O
And I'm going to pick up this color that already laid down, and we're going to make it a little bit.	O
More red.	O
We want to add some depth in here.	O
Make sure we have our.	O
Pen pressure turned on.	O
I'm just going to.	CHITCHAT
Gently brush in.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
It's OK if I go on top of the graph.	O
Because we'll end up putting the grass on top of this dirt, so I'm just kind of like layering this in right now.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Trying to get rid of these lines that we had.	O
Go back and pick up some of this color.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
This will just be like a base for our.	O
Color here, it will just do most of the shadows.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Kind of like this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do them better than that.	O
I'm going to probably redo that altogether.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But for this like party here I started out with a bigger brush and now I'm kind of like.	O
And I'm like change depression made a little bit smaller.	O
Trip tips like get some textures in here.	O
And then I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, some like little highlight areas.	O
Oh that's too much.	O
What happened here?	CHITCHAT
Let's start a new kind of look like a dirt Rd.	O
I think it would be nice if we threw some kind of grainy.	O
Texture on top of this.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
How do I found or how do you find shadow color?	O
Or how do you color or find shadows?	O
Uhm, well, I think mostly like picking color or something that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Kind of comes overtime.	CHITCHAT
I I had to watch a ton of videos on like.	CHITCHAT
Color theory, I think that's a good place to start is like watching stuff about color theory.	O
It's very complex and it has everything to do with.	CHITCHAT

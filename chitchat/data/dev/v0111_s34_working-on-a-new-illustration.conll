He like.	CHITCHAT
So this axis right here.	O
I like your value like light and dark.	O
This one is saturation.	O
And then this is Hugh, so this right here is up in the top corner.	O
That's like the purest form of this.	O
Q.	CHITCHAT
Along this side, so it's like I pull it this way, it's making it.	O
More desaturated an in this ones like making it darker in value since the war saturated but darker in value.	O
So it's like learning about that and like you don't want to like have colors like this.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like generally speaking, if you want your paintings to be more cohesive.	O
But I mean something you have to like.	CHITCHAT
Work on a lot an practice.	O
So and then as far as shadow colors.	O
That has to do more with like lighting and, um.	O
It's like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I'm trying to do this and talking same time.	CHITCHAT
So like your lighting and stuff, so it's like.	O
Warmer shadows will have army warmer light will have cooler shadows, so generally speaking I have like blueish purple shadows in like typical lighting situations.	O
Like if they light and stuff.	O
But I learned stuff about lighting and shadow from a book called.	O
Um color an light.	O
By James Gurney.	O
Oh, you know what I did all this was on the wrong layer or no, it's not.	CHITCHAT
You know what I did I have this adjustment layer turned on.	O
So whenever I pick up colors for cancer on one cool so I have to paint without my adjustment, I'll have to come back and turn it back on.	O
But yeah, color and light by James Gurney is the book that I recommend if you're trying to learn about lighting.	O
Well, and color I guess.	O
It is a fantastic book.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
It talks about like the shadow colors and stuff and like divided up into sections and as a bunch of different lighting situations.	O
Very helpful.	CHITCHAT
I know you can like find it online so.	CHITCHAT
Um and like there's little things that you'll need to learn about, like, um.	CHITCHAT
It's it's like.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Look what happened to her forehead.	O
Something happened.	O
I don't know it's because I have this turned off.	O
She had like spots on her forehead, then it's like words that line come from.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
As I talk about atmospheric perspective.	O
Like important to learn about.	O
So basically I mean will actually do this later but.	O
It's like stuff back here.	O
You get more of the Sky color.	O
Um mixed in.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Right now I'm just kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Blocking in like Maine.	O
Parts of the background and I'm going to.	O
Take another brush and.	O
Add some texture and some light color variation in here.	O
Yes, I got this like basic green down here.	O
And I'm going to take a.	O
Darker green with a.	O
Cooler shadow tone.	O
Just slightly.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to run for this.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what version is, maybe this one.	CHITCHAT

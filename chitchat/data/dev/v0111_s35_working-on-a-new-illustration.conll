This graph is pretty far away.	O
It's like it doesn't really matter if it's detail or not, like I don't have to go through and.	O
Do this you know.	O
Closer up stuff I might do a little bit of that like right here.	O
But I'm going to get a general.	O
Kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Texture laid down like that.	O
At least, that's how I can do it.	O
I always go back and I pick up the original color that I had down here.	O
2.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But I mean at this stage is always like this part always looks a little rough, but like once you add the lighting and stuff on top of it.	O
I think it looks a lot better.	O
Um, how do you know you're good at art?	CHITCHAT
Well, I think an important skill to learn is how to look at your art critic, Lee Ann.	CHITCHAT
I know like usually early on, that's not a skill that, uhm?	CHITCHAT
We all have to play cure ability observe.	CHITCHAT
And I mean really like, good art is subjective, but it's like.	CHITCHAT
If you're planning on.	CHITCHAT
Selling your work or doing art for other people.	CHITCHAT
There's a certain like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, um.	CHITCHAT
It's like people are looking for a certain quality so.	CHITCHAT
Um, by you having the ability to.	CHITCHAT
Like looking at.	CHITCHAT
Wait, you guys soon.	CHITCHAT
Right now or something, um.	CHITCHAT
Are you having the ability to look at your own work and say OK?	CHITCHAT
Is this on that level like that's so important to be able to do?	CHITCHAT
So I think I don't really understand like how to learn that other than like experience.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's something that's.	CHITCHAT
I think it comes over time with.	CHITCHAT
More drawing experience.	CHITCHAT
Don't know, hopefully after party I think.	CHITCHAT
I hope Chris let him outside.	CHITCHAT
His Jingle in the door.	CHITCHAT
So we probably trained him like has a little Jingle Bells on the door.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're just getting some texture in here.	O
Right now trying to.	O
Get something going.	O
I like I did this the wrong direction.	O
I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Send something working this way the whole time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like the grass right here.	O
It's not our focus, so we don't want to like.	O
Overly detail, everything will just wanted to be kind of.	O
Kind of subtle.	O
Have like the values in there, but.	O
I'll probably end up blurring the whole background anyways.	O
So it's like why spend your time doing something.	O
It's just going to be covered up, you know.	O
What's my favorite fresh for coloring?	CHITCHAT
Actually switch it up a whole lot.	CHITCHAT

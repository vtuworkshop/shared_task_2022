Um probably sounded kinda same way.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what this is right here that don't like it.	O
Get rid of it.	O
Somehow I started painting on the wrong layer.	O
Don't know how we got here.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh, I have a video about how to color hair.	CHITCHAT
On YouTube.	CHITCHAT
But since we already colored your hair, I'm not going to like.	CHITCHAT
Demo I, uh, my kind of color here right now.	CHITCHAT
So I have.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think my videos like how to draw here.	CHITCHAT
I don't think we really got into how to color all that much.	CHITCHAT
But at least it's a start I need to.	CHITCHAT
Make some more tutorials and stuff.	CHITCHAT
I just don't have time right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm working on it a lot of other stuff.	CHITCHAT
But it's on my list.	CHITCHAT
I have a lot of YouTube video suggestions like.	CHITCHAT
And my bullet Journal.	CHITCHAT
Hope it's got a whole page.	CHITCHAT
Dedicated to that and so.	CHITCHAT
Telling us appearing like Thunder or something outside I don't know what's going on.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't even look like it's going to rain.	CHITCHAT
How to color skin is also a video on my list.	O
But I need to make.	CHITCHAT
So it's.	CHITCHAT
Like I think you should look into um, like maybe try to do some studies like color settings and stuff.	O
Uhm, but well, actually before you do color cities, you should do value studies.	O
Have skin like black and white drawings of people and try to understand life forms and shading and stuff before you go into actually like.	O
Um coloring because you like.	O
If you start with that then will be a lot better off.	O
Rather than just jumping right into color, I think it makes things more complicated.	O
Voice wrong button.	CHITCHAT
Well, doesn't help if.	CHITCHAT
This is happening either like losing within pressure again.	O
I have a patreons I I think I would recommend mine.	CHITCHAT

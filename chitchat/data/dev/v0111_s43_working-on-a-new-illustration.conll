And it's like that one will be about.	CHITCHAT
But that's not until August.	CHITCHAT
So gotta while on that one.	CHITCHAT
But next month I think I was going to do how to color her next month.	CHITCHAT
Somebody suggested it sounds like any tutorial you'd want on Patris on, like I'm way open to suggestion so you can like tell me whatever you want me to do and like I'll be open to.	CHITCHAT
Making a tutorial about it.	CHITCHAT
'cause most of the time I'm just like, well, I think this would be good unless somebody tells me like Hey we should make this.	CHITCHAT
Then I make it.	CHITCHAT
But there's always like 2 new.	CHITCHAT
Like step-by-step someones usually like.	CHITCHAT
Like how to draw like I said like I did how to draw and paint eyes?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then the other ones usually like a walkthrough of one of my illustrations.	CHITCHAT
So if there's a specific one you want to know about, can suggest that too.	CHITCHAT
Um, now that's OK.	CHITCHAT
It gives me something to talk about.	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't know what to talk about it sometime.	CHITCHAT
What art convention do you like going to?	O
Uhm?	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
I usually go to ones.	O
An the Louisville, Ky Area.	O
'cause That's where I'm from.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I'm like I've table that one convention even though I want to table at more conventions we have come.	CHITCHAT
You know all of our cancels are conventions have been cancelled, so.	CHITCHAT
Can do those right now.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but I was going to do Lexington.	CHITCHAT
Comic Con.	CHITCHAT
Simply pretty close to me.	CHITCHAT
But I would like to start doing like conventions.	CHITCHAT
UM, like further away like go on trips and stuff to go.	CHITCHAT
Do conventions and like meet people.	CHITCHAT
I think that would be really cool like cabling.	CHITCHAT
As far as like conventions that I've been to that I really like, like Lightbox, hands down, best convention I've ever been to love it so much and I was so sad when they canceled it this year, which I mean of course it was understandable why they cancel it, but I am still going to miss it.	O
Because it's like what I look forward to.	CHITCHAT
Since I got tickets, I'm like.	CHITCHAT
Can't wait till September.	CHITCHAT
But I mean they're doing like virtual.	CHITCHAT
Light box and I think it's open to everybody.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But Right now.	CHITCHAT
Is disappointed.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how much I like, oh that's what we got going on up here.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how much it really makes sense.	CHITCHAT
How to liquify some things?	CHITCHAT
You don't have to be nervous to post your art.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's see I should probably put some oranges on this big old tree, huh?	O
One in the foreground.	O
Probably not that bright though.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT

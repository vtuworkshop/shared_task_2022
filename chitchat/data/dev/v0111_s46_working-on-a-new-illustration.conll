It helps you a separate your foreground in your background little better.	O
Makes it easier for your, for your eyes to like separate those.	O
Um, if you had kind of an effect like this.	O
Siri stop please.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I don't do it till like the entire thing.	O
Usually I just like a race out some stuff.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I can come in here and.	O
Probably had like a little bit of a darker color.	O
I also do it like.	CHITCHAT
In spots like this on a character.	O
For the light would kind of be like spilling over.	O
I think it kind of makes her look like she's.	O
Part of the background a little bit more like more cohesive I think.	O
Oh my gosh, I almost forgot to add the Flowers in her hair.	O
Need to do that.	CHITCHAT
We need to hear right now because I will forget.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you guys, um.	CHITCHAT
I'm so sorry I dropped my pin.	CHITCHAT
Uh, what is your favorite digital art piece you've ever done?	CHITCHAT
Uh, probably Dang it.	CHITCHAT
Come on.	CHITCHAT
I really like the UM mermaid.	CHITCHAT
He says I did this year.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, it's probably.	CHITCHAT
Actually no, I really like this Animal Crossing 1 two.	CHITCHAT
So I really like this one.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I did that pretty recently.	CHITCHAT
I like.	CHITCHAT
This one.	CHITCHAT
Like that one a lot.	CHITCHAT
And then I also like when I did last year.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
It would come up.	CHITCHAT
Like that one.	CHITCHAT
Definitely one of my favorite ones.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I put so much detail into this and stuff so it took a long time, but I really like the painting.	O
You kind of look that I got like in the details.	CHITCHAT
And that was from a guy zoomed out alot like I did in this one, but I used a different brush.	O
Maybe I should try to use not brush again.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to.	CHITCHAT
I need to turn this down a little bit.	O
So OK, we kind of did that and I'm going to add a little bit of a darker.	O
Blue tone in here too.	O
Fire suppression.	O
Brace myself.	CHITCHAT
Let's be darker than that.	O
So that that nice blue tone in there.	O
I really like this color.	CHITCHAT
But I did not set my pen pressure so little.	O
Little intense.	O
Came up, so I think that's pretty good and a little bit in the grass up here.	O
And then what will do is will do a multiply.	O
With a purple tone shadow.	O

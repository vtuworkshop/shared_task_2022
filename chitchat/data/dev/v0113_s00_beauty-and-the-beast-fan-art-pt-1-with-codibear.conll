So when you guys can see me and throw up my background sound really quick again.	CHITCHAT
Should be able to see me now.	CHITCHAT
I think we fixed it.	CHITCHAT
It looks like it's working now.	CHITCHAT
A tablet.	CHITCHAT
Yes, tablets working OK.	CHITCHAT
OK for anyone that's watching this vad right now.	CHITCHAT
Just a clarification.	CHITCHAT
Um, I had to restart the stream an my computer because I had to re update my tablet drivers for it to work but we are on our way now.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So the one little thing that I wanted to go back and fix in this illustration, it was not really a fix, but I felt like when I looked at this illustration after not seeing it for the weekend.	O
So I came back with fresh eyes.	CHITCHAT
I saw the top of her hair here.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The top of her hair like I love the little detail lines here, but then you look at the bottom of our hair and it's completely flat and it kind of looks a little weird.	O
Having volume volume indication lines on the top and not on the bottom.	O
So I think what I'm going to do is sit on the outline layer.	O
No, it's not.	CHITCHAT
Where did I have those those lines?	CHITCHAT
I guess I can just do it on the outline.	O
Is the big deal.	CHITCHAT
But I wanted to do is just add the same type of lines but I have.	O
For her.	O
For her bangs.	O
And then we will get started.	O
On the UM.	CHITCHAT
Beauty and the Beast Heart.	O
Hopefully I'm able to.	O
Do these ones the way I wanted to because I actually did try to do some detail lines and then I kind of gave up on it, but I definitely think it needs it.	O
Hi, so he'd welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I just joined.	CHITCHAT
Can you please explain what you're creating so this illustration I did of Cinderella last week?	CHITCHAT
I just wanted to, um, it's actually done.	CHITCHAT
I just wanted to come back and add these little lines to her hair really quick but in a minute we're going to be starting on a beauty and the Beast Fan Art.	O
Illustration.	O
And this is just, uh, yeah, this is just for fun.	CHITCHAT
It's not for a client or anything.	CHITCHAT
I wish I had Disney of the client.	CHITCHAT
OK, yeah, I think that looks better.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what it looks like without these top lines.	O
I think I like that better.	O
Little more simple.	O
OK.	O
I'll save.	O
And save as a PNG.	O
And then.	O
We can move onto starting our new sketch.	O
OK, let's make a new file and um.	O
Just do 8 by 10.	O
And let's go ahead and do.	O
Hey Sam, uh hello, hope you're having a good Monday.	CHITCHAT
Cody yeah it's it's it's, uh, going great so far.	CHITCHAT
Well we we had to stop and restart the stream 'cause I had to restart my computer because my tablet wasn't working because I needed to update my drivers.	CHITCHAT
But other than that we are going smoothly tablets working now.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's.	CHITCHAT
Go ahead and.	CHITCHAT
If only we could bippy boppy Boo for that.	CHITCHAT
I know, right?	CHITCHAT
Is the Thunder real?	CHITCHAT
No, it's a it's a YouTube video actually.	CHITCHAT
Background noise.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
He Brandon Welcome Let me know if it's too loud or too quiet.	CHITCHAT
I just turned it down a little bit because I notice that the audio levels were kind of loud.	CHITCHAT

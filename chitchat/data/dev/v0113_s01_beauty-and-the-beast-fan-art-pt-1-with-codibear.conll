OK, so let's grab my sketching brush.	O
And.	O
Let's bring up reference for Lumiere.	O
Let's do linear first.	O
He's so cute.	CHITCHAT
I actually have a little lamp that I got.	CHITCHAT
Oh it's right here.	CHITCHAT
I have this like he's like a little Lampi lights up.	CHITCHAT
Uh, that I got at Disneyland one here.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be doing linear in my style.	O
Uh, let's see.	CHITCHAT
I have this idea of, uhm, the scene.	CHITCHAT
Or a scene?	CHITCHAT
I guess it's it's going to be kind of an alteration of a scene in the movie, uhm?	O
Fireplace and see if I can look it up for reference.	O
Fireplace scene.	O
Beauty and the beast.	O
It's actually when they're sitting in front of the fireplace when she's like.	O
Uh, work like helping him heal his wounds, but I think I'm going to have fell just like sitting in the chair and reading a book.	O
So it'll be kind of.	CHITCHAT
It'll be this room, but also just be like an altered scene.	O
Or we also have this option where they're both sitting on the floor together.	O
I could like recreate this scene or I was thinking about adding in this chair here.	O
'cause I kinda like.	CHITCHAT
I really like the shape of this terror, like how exaggerated it is, how tall it is.	O
Yeah, I really wanted to draw this fireplace.	O
I was like this thing is really cool.	CHITCHAT
Again yeah, Cody were started and ended the stream.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we had to restart the stream because I had to update my tablet drivers.	CHITCHAT
They weren't working so I had to restart my computer.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK, so let's do it.	CHITCHAT
Let's do a thumbnail, shall we?	O
That's where we gotta start, right?	CHITCHAT
Um, this something else a little bit too wide for 8 by 10 it's going to be more like that.	O
OK, so let's make a new layer.	O
So again, I want to go with the, UM, flat flooring.	O
I'm probably going to make everything very flat, just like I did in the seller Cinderella illustration.	O
So that's going to be a perspective challenge for me to do a full indoor scene, lat.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
We shall see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
Um, so in these images.	CHITCHAT
The fireplace is actually at this angle, but we're going to recreate the fireplace as being seen from straight on.	O
Um, more so like this, it's going to be seen from straight great on.	O
Oh yeah, I can.	CHITCHAT
A tablet is definitely working now thankfully.	CHITCHAT
Hey Robert, how are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Welcome, I hope you had a good weekend.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot in the scene.	O
There's a lot going on, so we have our let's do like.	CHITCHAT
Our horizon is probably going to be like year maybe.	CHITCHAT
And then we have the big old big old hearth fireplace going on.	CHITCHAT
Um, that actually.	CHITCHAT
Probably would extend up pass, so there's going to be like the big mantle here and then the shape of it.	O
Shape of it is like this.	O

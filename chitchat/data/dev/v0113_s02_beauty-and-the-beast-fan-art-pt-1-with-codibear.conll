And then there's like, Shields up here.	O
And then.	O
Little Shields over here and then, Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh Fire.	O
And we have some columns here.	O
And swords at.	O
And then we have.	O
The tile in front of the fireplace.	O
And then there's also waynes coating on the wall.	O
And there is a rug on the floor actually.	O
In that case, let's make.	O
The tile in front of the fireplace, a little shorter it.	O
Let's make the rug come this way.	O
That's going to be flat and then there is a diamond pattern on the wall.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
And there is the like the waynes coding and then there's like Shields and stuff on the wall.	O
And there's also a little.	O
There's a bookshelf.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
How do I want to incorporate that?	CHITCHAT
Um, let's see the chair needs to go in here somewhere, so we're going to add the chair.	O
And we're going to have the chair face the camera, despite the fact that in the original seen, the chair is of course facing the fireplace.	O
Since we're doing the.	O
The want to move that.	O
So we're doing the flat perspective.	O
I want to be able to see the characters sitting in the chair.	O
And I'm going to put the chair like here.	O
Might change that.	O
Later.	O
But it's going there for now.	O
And there's like little details, more plot the details on the fireplace, lots of stuff going on there and then we got.	O
Oh, there's like this big curtain.	O
I definitely want to add in this curtain.	O
Really extravagant.	CHITCHAT
It's like being pulled by a rope and tassels, there's little.	O
Uh-huh And.	CHITCHAT
Let's move, let's move the chair a little bit closer to the fireplace.	O
I think, whoops, wrong there.	CHITCHAT
One kind of I think I want to kind of frame it between the fireplace in the curtain there.	O
And then we can do the footstool dog, right?	O
Any of you guys have seen beauty and the beast?	O
There's little footstool.	O
That originally was a dog can do him sitting there.	O
Uhm, and then we got some little pictures and.	O
We got like a shield on.	O
The wall in some pictures.	O
And then I want to have a Bell sitting in the chair reading a book.	O
And then beast.	O
Looking over the chair.	O
I know this looks like a huge mess right now, but it makes sense to me.	CHITCHAT
And it's like really tiny for you guys.	CHITCHAT
I realize that I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
That's what some nailing is really.	CHITCHAT
This is going to be looking over the chair at Bell.	O
Uhm, and then we got like earns and stuff on the.	O
Mantle.	O
I wonder if there's a picture above the fireplace.	CHITCHAT
You can't really speak it, actually don't really see it in the movie, I don't think.	CHITCHAT
So maybe I should make this fireplace just taller.	O
Then we won't have that that.	O
This short the.	O
In orbit at the top.	O
This whole.	O

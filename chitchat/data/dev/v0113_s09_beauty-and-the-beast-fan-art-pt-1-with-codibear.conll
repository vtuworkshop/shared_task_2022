It's a little bit.	O
Sticker on the top.	O
I don't know if I want to incorporate that or not.	CHITCHAT
Once I upload all my stuff to IG from the desktop.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, how I would love to to know how you do that.	CHITCHAT
Is it like a plugin or something?	CHITCHAT
Because I didn't think that you could do that like I know that Instagram is like updating their site so you can access.	CHITCHAT
You like, you can access DMS and stuff now, but I didn't realize that you could upload is it?	CHITCHAT
Is it just simply through the website or is it?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like Steven said, is it a tool?	CHITCHAT
OK, then he comes down like this.	CHITCHAT
My race around um, he felt like a little like this and then his torso is like here and then his arms come out from here and then he's got his like main body piece like this.	O
And then he's got some little pedestal parts.	O
And then that comes out like that.	O
And then he's got his foot.	O
Arms come out.	O
Boo.	CHITCHAT
They come up.	O
The metal part, the top of the metal part comes up.	O
This arm piece is even.	O
With this	O
I think it should come more like this.	O
And then he's got like these filigrees.	O
Come down like that and then he's got.	O
His little hands like this that hold the candle.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and then I'm just going to copy and paste that hand on the other side.	O
Alright, so he's got mine like this.	CHITCHAT

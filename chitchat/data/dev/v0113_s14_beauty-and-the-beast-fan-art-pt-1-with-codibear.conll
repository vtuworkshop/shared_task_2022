So I'm gonna draw his arm like this.	O
Always got like a little early peace.	O
So it comes up like this.	O
Down and around and then out.	O
He's got like his hands on his hips.	O
Flip this.	O
And put it right on the side.	O
Other side	O
Daily Show look into the stream.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing it to see you in here?	CHITCHAT
Oops, I just condense those layers.	O
Didn't want to do that.	O
So today we're working on a little beauty and the beast illustration.	O
I was just going to draw these guys just without a background, but I decided that I'll probably do a full background.	O
So this is the little thumbnail up here of the scene that we're going to do like with fireplace and stuff.	O
And what started this whole Disney kick was this illustration that we finished last week of the Cinderella scene that I've kind of wanted to do this scene for a long time and put it off and put it off and put it off because it like never turned out the way I wanted.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but I finally really like how this one turned out and so we're kind of going to do the same treatment to the beauty and the beast illustration.	CHITCHAT
Like with the really flat flat flooring and forced perspective and flat colors and stuff like that.	O
Uhm so yeah.	CHITCHAT
Kind of what we're working on that so freaking rad.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, yeah, so let's see.	CHITCHAT
So this is the fireplace room that I'm going to be doing this scene from.	O
I'm just going to be like altering this.	O
Where else going to be sitting in the chair?	O
Reading a book and this is just going to be kind of looking over the chair at what she's doing, but it's going to be like with this fireplace room scene.	O
And then I'm going to throw these characters in there somewhere.	O
That's why I'm sketching him out.	O
OK, so let's go back to cogs worth, so we got.	O
And then I definitely want to add some.	O
Some wood grain to him too, 'cause he's got some wood grain going on.	O
Once we finish these guys, then I'll probably um kind of blow up the thumbnail and I will start drawing over that for the final sketch.	O
Just kind of start flushing it out.	CHITCHAT
Be what we see what we got going on.	CHITCHAT
Here, little avatar haven't left.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Alicia.	CHITCHAT
Uh, he Jennifer welcome.	CHITCHAT
And so a long time no see how you been.	CHITCHAT
Uh, OK, so I need to put the canvas because this guy.	O
Oh yeah, he's yes.	CHITCHAT
Oh distorted.	O
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Cancel.	O
I think we're going to need to warp tool.	O
It's not to start work.	CHITCHAT
OK, there we go.	O
It's a little better.	O

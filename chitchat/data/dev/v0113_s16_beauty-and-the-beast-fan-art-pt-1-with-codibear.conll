OK, back to business.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK, let's get back to this, but here.	O
We're going to go straight across that way and then.	O
I don't know why I drew this horizontal line here, because that doesn't happen.	O
It goes straight up like this.	O
And then he's got like some borderline.	O
Make some gold borders.	O
OK, that's better.	CHITCHAT
Mobsters in could be funny spin-off.	CHITCHAT
OK, OK.	CHITCHAT

Damn.	CHITCHAT
Now it's not perfect, but that's OK.	CHITCHAT
It's just the sketch.	CHITCHAT
I usually come will just like fix I I usually really don't like.	CHITCHAT
Um, flush out my sketches all that much.	CHITCHAT
These ones are a little different.	CHITCHAT
Just because their characters.	CHITCHAT
So I want to make sure that I get all of their.	CHITCHAT
All of their characteristic stone.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But usually all kind of just go with a rough ish sketch and then do the coloring over top of it and then just kind of fix things as I do the coloring.	CHITCHAT
Looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
The image I now have my head as the Star Wars characters reimagined as bears.	CHITCHAT
That would be adorable.	CHITCHAT
Then Gotta get some ewoks in there.	CHITCHAT
There already bears.	CHITCHAT
I should draw an E walk.	CHITCHAT
Said that to list.	CHITCHAT
Bare necessities, Oh my gosh, now I have to put Jungle Book on there because of course I have to do Jungle Book because it's a bear.	CHITCHAT
My husband Jungle Book is actually my husband's favorite Disney movie.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I just realized I did his thumb.	O
I did his.	CHITCHAT
Walk.	O
Volcanes backwards, although they I guess they technically can't really be backwards because he's o'clock and they move, but typically.	O
I'm seeing that they are drawn in this angle locked in the movie.	O
This one, the long one more left.	O
I just had the canvas flips so I drew them backwards.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Who did the Paddington Films, Paddington, Paddington is not Disney but Paddington is amazing and my husband and I both love Paddington and I'll add Winnie the Pooh on there because, um, who is actually?	CHITCHAT
A huge inspiration of mine and who is definitely my favorite.	CHITCHAT
I've done one Winnie the Pooh illustration.	CHITCHAT
I did it.	CHITCHAT
I think it's on my Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I surprisingly, I've only ever drawn him once, considering how much I love him, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
It was I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think it was like sometime last year.	CHITCHAT
Scroll down a little bit.	O
But I kind of want to do a full scene.	O
I've always really loved.	CHITCHAT
The watercolor backgrounds in Winnie the Pooh.	CHITCHAT
They're just so beautiful.	CHITCHAT
The trees are rendered so beautifully.	CHITCHAT
I actually met Uhm Jim Cummings a couple years ago at New York Comic Con.	CHITCHAT
He's the voice of Pooh and Tigger.	CHITCHAT
He's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Uh, but yeah is there?	CHITCHAT
There's my little poo that was when I was still doing like watercolor texture for my back for my coloring.	CHITCHAT
So uh, it's definitely a little different.	CHITCHAT
I would I would do it a little differently now.	CHITCHAT
I forget who did Paddington.	CHITCHAT

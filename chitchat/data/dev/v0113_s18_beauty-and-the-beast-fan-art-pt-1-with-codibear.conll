If you're still there by the way.	CHITCHAT
I showed my husband the Hearthstone card backs that you made and he was like Oh my God, he was obsessed.	CHITCHAT
He loved and he used to be a a really big Hearthstone player.	CHITCHAT
Not so much anymore.	CHITCHAT
We both haven't played in quite awhile.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but yeah, we used to play pretty pretty often.	CHITCHAT
OK, um, let's start watching this thing out.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start with the UM, the fireplace, just because it's such a huge focal point and it's probably going to be like the easiest thing in the illustration.	O
Honestly, uhm, just because it's kind of more geometric.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
This columns are really interesting.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you know what?	CHITCHAT
They're like little, um, they're like little statuettes.	CHITCHAT
The columns, aren't they the top half of the problem?	CHITCHAT
You can't get a close enough look.	CHITCHAT
Oh, they are little people.	CHITCHAT
Really.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know, I thought they were just like swirly all the way up.	CHITCHAT
Maybe the fireplace is not going to be the easiest part.	CHITCHAT
OK well.	CHITCHAT
So let's do.	CHITCHAT
Let's do like the Shields or something?	O
Um, let's just go ahead and put this in a group.	O
Let's do sketch group blue.	O
I always do my sketch layers color coded as blue.	CHITCHAT
This is just my organization.	CHITCHAT
I used to actually sketch in blue like telephoto blue, but I don't anymore but that.	CHITCHAT
That is still relative in my head, the blue is always related to sketches.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's do.	CHITCHAT
Um, let's see.	CHITCHAT
So this shield, it's really difficult so I can look at this at an angle.	O
You know, I might be able to actually find a YouTube video of this scene and get better.	CHITCHAT
Get a better visual.	CHITCHAT
Of it.	CHITCHAT
From different angles, that's what I ended up doing for the UM, Cinderella piece.	CHITCHAT
Actually 'cause I just saw a YouTube video and just kind of free freeze framed on different scenes instead of.	CHITCHAT
Instead of Googling it.	CHITCHAT
But I think OK, so this shield is actually on this middle shield is actually on a plaque of of what it looks like.	O
When I go straight across.	O
And then so we have these swords here.	O
There's two swords behind the shield, but usually whenever I draw a very straight object at an angle, it becomes very krooked.	O
So what I'm going to do instead is I'm going to draw it just vertically, and then I will position it where it needs to be positioned.	O
I can just elongate it like that.	O
Dinner if I need too.	CHITCHAT
This guy.	CHITCHAT
Looks like it has like one of those calls.	CHITCHAT
It's like a hand guard.	CHITCHAT
I'm definitely going to need to look at some better detailing of this stuff.	CHITCHAT

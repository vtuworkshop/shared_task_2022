Less worried about that, which is kind of nice.	CHITCHAT
OK, and then there's also.	CHITCHAT
His little smaller Shields, even over here that are a little lower, more so near the.	O
Edge of the Earth itself, but they're actually full heart shapes.	O
They're like little gold heart shapes.	O
They were going to do.	CHITCHAT
Our view that was a good heart shaped Cody.	CHITCHAT
Wow, I'm impressed.	CHITCHAT
That was a very lucky line.	CHITCHAT
I usually usually have a lot.	CHITCHAT
I usually have to redraw hearts a lot.	CHITCHAT
Then it's got.	CHITCHAT
Alicia says, I feel that thanks for sharing your feel the same way.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, usually like when I used to stream on Twitch Uhm.	CHITCHAT
I would usually always have a sketch ready to go.	CHITCHAT
I would sketch off stream um.	CHITCHAT
And then I would use that sketch during the stream.	CHITCHAT
But when I started streaming on be hands, I was like, you know, like that's so much work to do off stream, um, so much time put into this drawing that I've done off stream that people can even watch me do so uhm, you know, I mean, that could have taken up like the sketching process.	CHITCHAT
People want to see that sketching process an even as an artist myself, I love seeing peoples sketching process.	CHITCHAT
I love seeing peoples messy.	CHITCHAT
Early stages to see.	CHITCHAT
Where they got what it took to get to the final, especially like if I'm a fan of their work and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Um, so I just kind of had to try to suck it up.	CHITCHAT
And once I started doing it, uhm, it wasn't so bad.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
This hearth Is, uhm, of course my sketches really bad looking right now.	CHITCHAT
But oh shoot, what do you go?	CHITCHAT
This hearth is actually triangular shape on the top.	O
That's really interesting.	CHITCHAT
So let's do.	CHITCHAT
Like this?	CHITCHAT
And the.	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Please copy and paste that.	O
Jennifer says yes.	CHITCHAT
I've been watching people do sketch work lately and it really helps me to see that struggle.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's that's the part that's hard as an artist to have, you know, hundreds of people watching you struggle while you draw, uhm, but that those can be the best process times to for viewers to be able to see the artist struggling.	CHITCHAT
But Kind of difficult.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
So I think the edge of that.	CHITCHAT
Is the bread with the inside?	CHITCHAT
I can?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the inside you can see the brake lines OK?	O
So and it actually has.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
It goes across like this.	O
Actually.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do one straight line.	O
Like this across.	O
And I'm going to erase this fit here.	O
And so this is open on the bottom.	O

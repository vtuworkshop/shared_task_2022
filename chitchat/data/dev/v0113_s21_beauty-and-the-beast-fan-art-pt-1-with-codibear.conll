So those are going to be the bricks.	O
And then we got the columns.	O
Um, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Columns are like marble.	O
So, since we're going to be doing flat perspective, OK, so in the Cinderella piece we did, let's look at the columns we did here, so these ones were just flat, straight across, and I'm probably going to do the same thing or these ones.	O
So this one.	O
Goes.	O
Like this right across flat lines.	O
Let's actually use shift to hold down shift to make perfectly straight lines.	O
And then yes, it is not tapered.	O
It is just straight up and it goes up.	O
A little bit past.	O
The corner of this piece.	O
Corner of the brick.	O
And Go like that.	O

I'm going to move it over a gila the little bit.	O

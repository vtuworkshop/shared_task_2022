Driving into the city.	CHITCHAT
I'll see you all later after annotation and all that.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking forward to see how this turns out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no problem.	CHITCHAT
Jennifer drive safe.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate you stopping in and hanging out.	CHITCHAT
It was good to see you again.	CHITCHAT
And by the way guys, I will also be modding Adobe Live Today.	CHITCHAT
We are back with Adobe live this week.	CHITCHAT
Last week all the Adobe employees had the week off.	CHITCHAT
But they're starting again.	CHITCHAT
They might be live already.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but yeah, I will be modding Monday.	CHITCHAT
Monday Wednesday, Thursday, Friday for Adobe live.	CHITCHAT
By the way, Speaking of schedule, I am going to be streaming Monday, Wednesday, Friday this week, but the past few weeks I've been doing Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, but we're changing it up a little bit just because.	CHITCHAT
I was in the ER yesterday and I just want to give myself a bit of a break in between streams.	CHITCHAT
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, OK, so.	CHITCHAT
So since we're doing, I'm going to do the horizon next.	O
Let's do the floor since we're doing a perfectly flat floor.	O
I'm still new to this.	CHITCHAT
Still working on my forced perspective here, but I feel a little bit more confident about it after doing this Cinderella scene.	CHITCHAT
I feel like the floor looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Um, so we're going to do the same treatment.	CHITCHAT
As.	CHITCHAT
The Cinderella one with the flat floor.	CHITCHAT
Let's try it.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's make a new layer.	O
And we're going to hold down shift and.	O
We are going to put the floor about year.	O
And then the waynes coating.	O
When coding goes up a little bit, actually it goes up higher than I had it in the sketch it goes up.	O
It's like 2/3 of the wall instead of 1/3 of all.	O
Very high waynes coating.	O
It goes up to about here.	O
Uhm and then.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Marble piece in front of the fireplace extends past.	O
The columns so it goes to about here.	O
Again, farther than I had it in the original sketch.	O
OK, so I'm going to see I'm going to put this in here.	O
I'm actually going to make this a little smaller just because I need some more canvas space.	O
Just going to extend this out a little bit more.	O
Have you guys ever seen spirit?	CHITCHAT
That was a dream works movie, but I loved that movie as a kid.	CHITCHAT
Was the horse movie spirit stallion of the semoran?	CHITCHAT
That one was super good.	CHITCHAT
So I think I I don't want to, but the UM, fireplace up to the wall too close.	O
I want to give it some breathing room.	O
There we go, now it's even.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how I'm going to crop it just yet.	CHITCHAT
For some reason, that doesn't look even, but it is.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's do the same thing for the waynes coding.	O
Let's just bring this line all the way over.	O
Just in case I need a little bit more.	O
On the left side.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And we are going to.	O
Do the depth of the bottom part of the like the marble like this just with completely flat line and it's got let's see.	O

Actually got a little bit of an indent.	O
In the centre here.	O
I love adding all these small little details because the small little details the details that you don't really notice when you're looking at the big picture is what really makes the scene.	CHITCHAT
I was just talking about that with my husband while we were playing the Last of Us.	CHITCHAT
And I was like, you know, like all of these.	CHITCHAT
As an artist, I feel like I notice these things.	CHITCHAT
You know, like all of these little tiny details in the world.	CHITCHAT
Like all of this clutter and all of the trash and everything, somebody had to model that every single little piece somebody had a model that end place that an it's all of these little pieces that while you're just walking by in the game, you don't really notice it.	CHITCHAT
But if it wasn't there, you would notice that it wasn't there because the world was literally empty.	CHITCHAT
Um, so it's kind of just like white noise when you don't notice it, but the Clutter is what really makes everything look lived in an look real.	CHITCHAT
So I always like to add as much detail as possible.	CHITCHAT
So agreed, I'm so horrible backgrounds.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, Alicia.	CHITCHAT
So am I.	CHITCHAT
I am like brand new two, doing indoor environments and I've spent years trying to figure out perspective in a way that works for me, like because I would always try to do everything 3D with like perfect perspective and it just never worked for me and I always avoided doing interior illustrations because I could just never turn out.	CHITCHAT
Though I wanted to and then like about.	CHITCHAT
Six or eight months ago I started really practicing forced perspective and, um, drawing everything really flat like this is really what works for me.	CHITCHAT
Like just in recent time.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I did this illustration.	CHITCHAT
This was like the first successful indoor illustration that I've ever done.	CHITCHAT
It was like.	CHITCHAT
And I I finally finally just clicked with me.	CHITCHAT
I was like, OK well.	CHITCHAT
Like all of the floor, texture is just completely flat.	O
There's no perspective to it at all, and everything is just lined up with the wall, so that is the style that I'm kind of like leaning towards and kind of forcing myself to work towards because I've I'm finding that that's what works for me, so doing all of the detail that I possibly can and just kind of like reworking this scene into a flat scene.	O
There's a little bit of problem solving there because you kind of have to think about how the shapes would look if they were flat as as opposed to just looking at this 3D scene, but it's a bit of a process, but I feel like it's going to look pretty good once it's done.	O
I need that cafe and assemble.	CHITCHAT
I wish that cafe existed.	CHITCHAT
It looks it looks pretty warm and nice.	CHITCHAT
Have to look into that.	CHITCHAT
'cause I can't draw perspective either.	CHITCHAT
So the thing about forced perspective is that.	O
You definitely need to know the rules of perspective before you can do forced perspective.	O
Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Like I know.	CHITCHAT
What looks right?	CHITCHAT
To a certain extent, of course, but you kind of have to know the rules of perspective first to be able to break them basically.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
For many years like I said, like I spent years and years and years studying perspective and I could draw in perspective, I could draw like objects in perspective.	CHITCHAT
Like I can draw.	CHITCHAT
I can do like I could draw like a little book for you guys.	CHITCHAT
Like I can draw things in perspective.	CHITCHAT
I can do objects pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But when it comes to doing full environments, I am terrible at doing full environments.	CHITCHAT
So to a certain extent.	CHITCHAT
I do actually know perspective, but.	CHITCHAT
I'm kind of like using it in a different way to my advantage, and to help my style.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, there's a little.	CHITCHAT
There's a little book.	CHITCHAT
But also at this point, honestly I feel like drawing things in perspective like this.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't look.	CHITCHAT

Like me enough.	CHITCHAT
I feel like that just kind of looks like a generic.	CHITCHAT
Perspective drawing book like it doesn't look like it's my style at all, so I feel like the more that I lean into the flat perspective, the more recognizable of a style.	CHITCHAT
I will create an kind of refine.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know 4th perspective was a thing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you know honestly, uhm, you should really look into children's illustration because children's illustration forced perspective is used a lot.	CHITCHAT
Like I can't think of any.	CHITCHAT
Artists write off the top of my head being put on the spot like this, but if you go to my Instagram and go to like my following list, I'm pretty much kind of only following artists that I really love.	CHITCHAT
Don't mind the Animal Crossing accounts.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise I'm pretty much only following artists like children's illustration artist that I love and a lot of them used forced perspective and that's where I learned of it from and I kind of started studying their work.	CHITCHAT
And I was like, OK, I really love this style.	CHITCHAT
How can I?	CHITCHAT
How can I force myself to kind of learn this in my own way?	CHITCHAT
Like, oh, you know what I have a good example?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, let's see.	CHITCHAT
What's her name, men?	CHITCHAT
Let me look it up really quick, you guys.	CHITCHAT
This will be a good example of forced perspective.	CHITCHAT
It'll take me just one second.	CHITCHAT
I need to look at my saved.	CHITCHAT
Saved files on my.	CHITCHAT
Instagram Um, that's another thing too.	CHITCHAT
Is that like on my Instagram I have you can save collections an I have just an entire huge folder of Art Inspo.	CHITCHAT
Whenever I find a piece of artwork that I'm even mildly inspired by, I will save it to the to the Art Inspo Collection so I can go back and reference it and be like OK, how did this person draw this thing?	CHITCHAT
Um, let's see where was that?	CHITCHAT
I will find it, I swear.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Is this one of hers?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how to pronounce the name exactly you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah you too.	CHITCHAT
But she has some really great work.	CHITCHAT
So here, look at this.	CHITCHAT
Here's a really flat image.	O
If you look at the flooring.	O
Like this image, almost like it looks like it has perspective, but in reality it really doesn't like if you look at all of the furniture, all of the furniture is straight on and she used it's kind of almost like a like a top down view.	O
Um in Alton, the floor like the rug is perfect.	O
It's a perfectly straight rectangle.	O
But it looks right, right?	CHITCHAT
Like it, like she pulls it off so well this this one.	CHITCHAT
The flooring isn't perfectly straight down, but everything is straight on this way.	O
There's no perspective to the furniture, it's all just straight on straight lines.	O
This one to this one is just a flat rug, completely flat.	O
So yeah, there's a ton of artists that, uhm, that you can look at specifically for children's illustration that you'll find a lot of inspiration for forced perspective.	CHITCHAT
Even just like going to Barnes and Noble and.	CHITCHAT
Checking out like the kids section and just like flipping through a bunch of books, I'm sure you'll find some full inspiration.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I'm like so talking so much and not even working, um.	CHITCHAT
But I hope that was helpful to you guys none the less.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Back to business.	CHITCHAT
Back to the business.	CHITCHAT
Let's do the let's see the curtain because that takes up a big portion of the waynes coating.	O
I love how how you keep a pushing yourself to find your style.	CHITCHAT
Yeah you know I used to be uhm.	CHITCHAT
I used to not really not like my style at all.	CHITCHAT

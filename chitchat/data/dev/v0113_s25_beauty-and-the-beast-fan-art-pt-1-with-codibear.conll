I used to have a lot of envy towards other artists.	CHITCHAT
Um, about home in, you know, like grass is greener syndrome.	CHITCHAT
Like Oh, I wish my style looked more like this or.	CHITCHAT
Yadda Yadda Yadda.	CHITCHAT
But I have definitely gotten to a point where I actually really love my style.	CHITCHAT
I have come to accept it.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, and the more I work at it, the more I can make it the way that I really want it to look.	CHITCHAT
Another example that I talk about to make my style look more like me is that I don't use fonts anymore.	CHITCHAT
I used to like if I did text on my illustration I would usually do a font and then just kind of trace over it.	CHITCHAT
But nowadays I only hand write things because.	CHITCHAT
For one, I usually have my work.	CHITCHAT
I usually have my work, um.	CHITCHAT
Wanting to look more rustic.	CHITCHAT
And nowadays I pretty much only handwrite everything, so I just hand write it in a cran and nobody can copy my handwriting.	CHITCHAT
You know, like that is specifically unique to me, so it makes it even more look like OK, that's Cody's brand.	CHITCHAT
And it's kind of differentiates me from.	CHITCHAT
From someone else.	CHITCHAT
That is, my goal is to differentiate my artwork from everything else that you see on line, because I mean.	CHITCHAT
If you know clients are looking specifically for somebody who has.	CHITCHAT
A different look, you know?	CHITCHAT
OK, so this piece this top piece is kind of like.	O
Would be like it's kind of like a long swoop and then the piece underneath is like.	O
Aloe swoop like this.	O
And then.	O
It comes down.	O
Not that far though.	O
Stand up there for the floor is.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And then we'll just go straight across.	O
And we got some rope.	O
Holding this thing up.	O
It's like an art class.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Cody.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you guys, uh, I'm glad you guys are gaining something out of it.	CHITCHAT
And I'm not just like rambling and wasting time.	CHITCHAT
I am happy to help if anyone has any questions or wants any resources.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, it's kind of hard to think of resources off the top of my head and I wish that I could share my link my Instagram link to my saved illustration folder, but I can't.	CHITCHAT
They don't.	CHITCHAT
They don't create a link for that and I really wish they did.	CHITCHAT
It's more of like a private private collections on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
It's not like like Pinterest where you can just.	CHITCHAT
Like share your folder.	CHITCHAT
OK, so then there's got.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of weird because.	CHITCHAT
Another brain teasers.	CHITCHAT
So I'm drawing this on the opposite, like the opposite angle that is in the.	O
In the reference, so I'm kind of like having to flip flop it in my head.	O
This actually I think I need to make this a little bit more droopy.	O
Doesn't look supernatural.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you know why you guys?	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh I.	CHITCHAT
I'm 10 minutes overtime.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even realize I was just like chat and chat and chat and over here.	CHITCHAT
Let's Chatty Cathy.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go for one more minute, actually.	CHITCHAT
Just drawing these lines, but then I really have to go.	CHITCHAT
Because I'm odd or Adobe live in like an hour now I need to take a break.	CHITCHAT
I have to go right?	CHITCHAT
Some copy things are streaming.	CHITCHAT
I love hanging out, yeah, no problem.	CHITCHAT
Alicia, thanks for thanks for stopping by.	CHITCHAT
You been so helpful.	CHITCHAT
Oh I'm so glad.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright you guys I am going to head out now.	CHITCHAT
I need to go get some lunch and stuff like that but I will be back.	CHITCHAT
I mean on my channel on Wednesday and then Friday after that and we will continue to work on this little drawing here we will continue these sketch an I will also look for some better references so I can get a better view of the fireplace and such.	CHITCHAT

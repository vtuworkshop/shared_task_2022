Everyone, how are you guys?	CHITCHAT
Welcome back.	CHITCHAT
First things first, I gotta haircut.	CHITCHAT
It's very different and I'm not used to it at all.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be like awkwardly like this the whole time I think I'm going to have the Cam off the stream so I can just go like this 17 times a minute.	CHITCHAT
How are you all doing?	CHITCHAT
I hope everybody had a great weekend.	CHITCHAT
If you were in the states.	CHITCHAT
Happy 4th.	CHITCHAT
I hope you were able to get a little bit more sleep last night than I was able to.	CHITCHAT
Here's a lot of fireworks.	CHITCHAT
It could work a little bit more of this piece.	CHITCHAT
I worked on this tiny bit off stream today and not too much, just.	CHITCHAT
Starting to figure out a bit of the detail an the ground an in some of these cargo like crates back here behind the characters.	O
In turn the lines off this is looking kinda nice so far.	O
And I added a couple more details to the ground here, some more like food and elements, and making you feel a little bit more homely for these characters to live in.	O
If you haven't been here before, my name is negan on the character and pop designer in the animation industry.	CHITCHAT
I've worked on animated television shows in the states for about five years now.	CHITCHAT
I really love my job and in my off time I love to push myself to like, improve my skills, get more into painting and illustration comics, and kind of push myself towards my like personal like dream job of working as a more like conceptual visual development artist on feature animated films.	CHITCHAT
This piece is then it's so much fun to work with.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I'm learning a lot and is turning out really good and let's continue working on it today.	CHITCHAT
This is probably going to be just a pretty like chilled hating stream.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of small detail distantly to add into this and just going to kind of relax.	O
Hang out with y'all are working on it, so let's get started.	CHITCHAT
This is also a tiny bit loud.	CHITCHAT
Turn it down.	CHITCHAT
Money over still at Keith.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
I've been ready since noon.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Welcome friend.	CHITCHAT
OK, now it's too quiet.	CHITCHAT
This one is just right.	CHITCHAT
OK, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, let's see where we leave off.	CHITCHAT
Where shall we start?	CHITCHAT
I think when I can't focus on right now, like the characters are pretty blocked in an.	O
I don't want to get.	O
Too much into the smaller details on them, yet I think what I want to focus on is still right now is building up the environment will give a little bit more and getting to the point where we can start to like turn off the line art layers and get some nice rendering that we're working on on Fridays stream.	O
By the way, thank you for hanging out on Friday.	CHITCHAT
Stream is super super fun chatting with you guys.	CHITCHAT
Sounds good, send character layers off.	O
Turn off their liner as well.	O
In the character 'cause they added it in later on.	O
Now we have these lines of additional like new items.	O

Why not hold so much something up on there?	CHITCHAT
But Languages are available.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure that I know it's a should have been adding a lot more to their selection.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how big it is.	CHITCHAT
Who is Ireland?	CHITCHAT
A few years ago, all my gosh.	CHITCHAT

I take that back.	CHITCHAT
Knock on wood.	CHITCHAT
I honestly, as far as I know, I don't really have any relation.	CHITCHAT
It just looks beautiful like I want to go see castles and rolling Green Hills like, yeah?	CHITCHAT

Welcome?	CHITCHAT
How was your weekend?	CHITCHAT
I guess it is it.	CHITCHAT
Is it Monday for you already or is it still Sunday?	CHITCHAT
How was your weekend?	CHITCHAT
How is your weekend?	CHITCHAT
Depending what time it is for you?	CHITCHAT
Painting a little bit more on this team.	O
He added a lot of extra elements into the interior of the plane.	O
Now I think it makes you feel a little bit more lived in added some food, little some baskets and more plants.	O
Just sort of stuff astute about the full floor.	O
I like how it looks.	CHITCHAT
Not the fireworks out of door.	CHITCHAT
Yeah sorry but he Martin.	CHITCHAT
How are you welcome?	CHITCHAT
Sorry there is some fireworks going off in my neighborhood right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to turn my mic down at TI tiny bit.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if that helps with it and I'm also going to.	CHITCHAT
You guys can see this will push it closer to my face.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully you'll just get more of my voice and less in the background.	CHITCHAT
It isn't even Monday.	CHITCHAT
The weekend was not long enough.	CHITCHAT
All I'm sorry to hear that.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I apologize for the fireworks, you guys this this weekend was a holiday in the United States.	CHITCHAT
It was IV our Independence Day and it's traditional to set off fireworks.	CHITCHAT
But this year because of the covid lock down, a lot of people were stuck at home.	CHITCHAT
So my neighbors have been going a little crate like overboard with the fireworks, more so than usual.	CHITCHAT
It's it's a little much.	CHITCHAT
And the holiday is already over, but apparently they have some leftover because they're still doing it, and it's kind of annoying.	CHITCHAT
Not gonna lie.	CHITCHAT
Image how are you this?	CHITCHAT
He's looking good.	CHITCHAT
Feeling is such a good feeling of death all thank you much.	CHITCHAT
How was your weekend?	CHITCHAT
That's very kind of you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is turning out.	CHITCHAT
So far so good.	CHITCHAT
You should have laid in.	CHITCHAT
I think all the elements now just spent the last hour adding a few more details and now it's just sort of.	O
Getting All the everything painted in all the details is just sort of that long slow slug to the finish line at this point.	O
I think I want Lucas little bit more in the environment right now and then.	O
Save the really in depth character painting for the next stream.	O
That sort of rewarding myself 'cause I enjoy the character stuff more personally.	CHITCHAT
If it's on some more of a character artist myself, so I kind of.	CHITCHAT
View that as.	CHITCHAT
You know, I think we described it like this last stream.	CHITCHAT
I was like you have to eat your vegetables before you can have dessert.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to focus on.	CHITCHAT
Trying to get the the environment to feel really, really nice to them.	CHITCHAT
The desert will be painting the characters.	CHITCHAT
It was good.	CHITCHAT
I hope the same for you.	CHITCHAT
Just hanging out with his chill tunes and art.	CHITCHAT
Listen to you before bed.	CHITCHAT
All that's that's exactly the kind of I'm going for right now.	CHITCHAT
I want this just like a nice chill.	CHITCHAT
Nice music painting.	CHITCHAT
Relax, hang out talking to chat.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I honestly didn't do it yesterday.	CHITCHAT

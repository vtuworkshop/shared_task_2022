No dice.	CHITCHAT
Pat And then I got my car fixed as it is in our rooms.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
, hair done.	CHITCHAT
My hair did earlier today this morning it was fun.	CHITCHAT
It had been at least maybe even a year so I've got no not here, but at least six months since I last got it cut.	CHITCHAT
So that was really nice to finally.	CHITCHAT
Finally, get my like scrappy, mangy main taken care of.	CHITCHAT
And then last night, um.	CHITCHAT
Sort of.	CHITCHAT
Last night, the night before I should say I just chilled off some movies husband.	CHITCHAT
Netflix and show how we can we be signed up for Disney possums unhappy before because I want to watch Hamilton?	CHITCHAT
Please just accept the fact I'll never actually get to see them play 'cause they don't feel like Cincinnati.	CHITCHAT
$700.00 on a play so.	CHITCHAT
Invited to watch the recording, but the other day you just sort of ended up watching frozen 2 just sort of to see how it was.	CHITCHAT
'cause I've never seen it and I heard pretty net universally negative things from all of my friends who are like who work in animation.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I was like Alright, Let's see how this is an.	CHITCHAT
We watched it and.	CHITCHAT
I try not to like that Malkin movies especially you know I have a lot of respect for Disney as a studio and stuff but.	CHITCHAT
Who boy frozen?	CHITCHAT
She was pretty bad like it was.	CHITCHAT
It was like.	CHITCHAT
It was pretty bad.	CHITCHAT
I think disappointing is a better way to describe it, like it's like.	CHITCHAT
It could have been so much more and it just wasn't and it was like so many like.	CHITCHAT
Uh, this opportunities or like they?	CHITCHAT
They went for something that they jumped and then they didn't make it.	CHITCHAT
It is a little painful to get through.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we also restart washing mandalorian as well.	CHITCHAT
Even yeah, we watched.	CHITCHAT
I think we watched the first 2 episodes and we've just started the 3rd.	CHITCHAT
We haven't gotten far into it at all, like a minute has the opening sequence or something.	CHITCHAT
I like it.	CHITCHAT
Has lookup an interesting vibe to it so far.	CHITCHAT
Even row, all I heard was about frozen 2 was that it was a toy advertisement with mcguffin spirit that rips off crimes.	CHITCHAT
I guess I'm not super familiar with like Grimes is.	CHITCHAT
Anything so I wouldn't know what they ripped off, but.	CHITCHAT
It felt like.	CHITCHAT
What it felt like to me.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how how better to describe this then uhm.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure you've seen this Dylan, or actually.	CHITCHAT
Even so, I feel like you would get this.	CHITCHAT
What time do you like?	CHITCHAT
Lindsay Ellis, right?	CHITCHAT
Her her YouTube channel like a video essays and stuff.	CHITCHAT
It was in the honest trailer.	CHITCHAT
Oh OK, I'll check that out of this room.	CHITCHAT
But I'm yeah if you watch Lindsay Ellis is video where she talks about everything that she didn't like about the Disney live action, beauty and the beast.	CHITCHAT
That's exactly how I feel about frozen.	CHITCHAT
Basically it felt like it's the entire movie was more preoccupied with trying to answer like dumb Internet criticisms about the curse movie then actually like forwarding a pod.	CHITCHAT
Hills high note with a pre she ate it work OK got you?	CHITCHAT
Without it like that video in particular like Distilling that that same energy is sort of how I felt watching it.	CHITCHAT
And it also unfortunately there are a couple of his songs, but generally I would say the music is not nearly as good and it's you know it's a Disney musical.	CHITCHAT
So that unfortunately really makes a big difference.	CHITCHAT
Yesterday, not just exist after now.	CHITCHAT

But a job it in today 'cause I couldn't do it on when or on Friday and then I didn't have time yesterday so I'm just going to fit it in now.	CHITCHAT
So it's kind of a postponed stream that we're doing today.	CHITCHAT
Time now character design.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we're good.	CHITCHAT
Yep, Yep.	CHITCHAT
Looking good sweet.	CHITCHAT
All right, we're going to be jumping into the Miss Chievous character today.	O
I honestly don't really remember what we did.	CHITCHAT
Last year on be hands.	CHITCHAT
Last time on the heads, was it the brave character?	CHITCHAT
Did we not do the.	CHITCHAT
You know this kind of sounds familiar 'cause we were here on Wednesday and then.	CHITCHAT
That means that I had a Thursday and Friday stream before now on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
So that was two streams.	CHITCHAT
So I think you guys missed a full character.	CHITCHAT
So let me let me catch you up where we're at today.	CHITCHAT
We're working on the Artstation Challenge.	O
If you guys don't know what I'm talking about, I can post that in the chat.	CHITCHAT
But the art station challenge.	CHITCHAT
Is 6 characters, so if you go to my my.	CHITCHAT
Portfolio my profile page on be hands.	CHITCHAT
You'll see this.	CHITCHAT
I need to update my be hands so it has this latest project.	CHITCHAT
There is my.	CHITCHAT
The link for this and chat, but if you get a challenges.	CHITCHAT
You'll see the box of mystery character design.	CHITCHAT
That's what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
If you go to the very top of the page up here challenges, it will take you to it so you can read more about it if you want.	CHITCHAT
But if you scroll all the way down to my first post, you'll see the story behind this group.	CHITCHAT
Let's see who each character is at the bottom here.	CHITCHAT
Down here and I post everything we've done so far for it.	CHITCHAT
It's not completely up-to-date, actually know maybe it is.	CHITCHAT
We have all the costumes that have done for each of the six characters.	CHITCHAT
And then I started posting the works in progress of.	CHITCHAT
Cool, I'll check it out.	CHITCHAT
The works in progress of the characters here.	CHITCHAT
Yes, yes, we actually are up today.	CHITCHAT
Never mind, I'm not up to date on my Twitter with the post.	CHITCHAT
I'm up-to-date here.	CHITCHAT
This was the last character we did the.	CHITCHAT
The joyful character which you guys missed.	CHITCHAT
This is what I did on my Twitch stream, so just a little process lines flat colors.	CHITCHAT
Rough painting, and that's what we're going to be trying to do.	O
Today we got two hours, so I'm going to be doing a.	O
Flag, color and painting.	O
Hopefully the lines are just about there, so we're not too far off in that regard.	O
But yeah, a little bit behind schedule because that is 3 ruffins that we have one 2 three.	CHITCHAT
The ideas after today will have 4.	CHITCHAT
OK, now I was like wait a minute, that's not right.	CHITCHAT
So there's one character rough in that I haven't shown you guys yet and that's the leader character, but you've seen that on other streams, so we actually have 4 characters worked up today.	O
We're doing the 5th, so I haven't posted everything yet.	O
The reason I haven't posted that other character that is worked up already is 'cause she's I'm going like in order from left to right.	O
From here, so I posted these three on the left.	O
Next is the one we're working on today, and then the wild characters, the one that will still have to do the leader character has been worked up already, so I'm just going to post her last so.	O
The posting is a little bit behind by one character, but you know after today the ideas that we have one more character to work up, which I would have liked to have done this weekend.	CHITCHAT
If I have some time today I'll try it, but I probably won't have a lot to do today.	CHITCHAT
And as always, so little time to do it.	CHITCHAT
So this is our mischievous character.	O
She is the illusionist.	O
In Sabae Tour of the group.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	O
Just checking, I thought I had a reference, but may I may not.	O

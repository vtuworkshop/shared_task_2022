So.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna take this, turn it down even further.	O
From 41 to 21, lock it and I will drop this.	O
Photo shop you drive me nuts sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's get this arm.	O
It's probably around there.	O
Like the curvature of this.	O
Arm.	O
Then you can kind of see this overlapping shape slightly.	O
Has the pretty.	O
Pretty good reference.	O
So I'd like to.	CHITCHAT
I like to draw the pose the best I can just to get the idea out of my head, but.	O
A lot of times, especially with hands, but you know a lot of times with a lot of things, it could be the pose.	O
It could be whatever but a lot of times with hands.	O
All actually take the reference after I do the sketch.	O
Just because.	O
Drawing a hand from my imagination is never.	O
Kind of quite be up to snuff of referencing it, but I do like to get the idea out of my head and then.	O
Informant with a reference.	O
Which I kind of been thinking lately.	CHITCHAT
I should probably be doing that with poses too.	CHITCHAT
I like to draw my imposes.	CHITCHAT
This would be a very hard post for me to take a reference of myself, but a lot of poses, especially if they're just kind of standing, poses just to get that weight distribution looking natural.	O
I've been thinking I should reference poses more as well with actual self.	O
Reference pictures like this.	O
So maybe I'll do that and see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
See if it helps my pose game a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Again, get the idea out of my head first, but.	CHITCHAT
Like check my work and stuff with that.	CHITCHAT
Self reference.	O
Break legs from jumping reference.	O
Yeah, by the trampoline and like an automated cameras something they probably do it myself.	O
I'm fairly comfortable just making up references, but there's definitely times where.	CHITCHAT
It's usually after the fact.	CHITCHAT
I'll kind of see my reference and being like.	CHITCHAT
Or else the pose I did certain on my reference and I'll kind of be like I think it's a little bit stiffer than it probably should be.	CHITCHAT
You know, maybe if I had posed for that.	CHITCHAT
It would have worked out better.	CHITCHAT
In general, I just need to do more figure drawing too, though I've really been aware of the past few months that I've slacked on, like figure drawing, anatomy, practice.	CHITCHAT
I used to do that all the time.	CHITCHAT
We used to do like nothing but anatomy practice.	CHITCHAT
To the detriment of like.	CHITCHAT
You should be working on your own ideas to should be drawing things from your head and practicing that imagination game and you're keeping that muscle of like coming up with ideas.	O
Keep that worked out.	O
I kind of did the opposite where I just jump in nothing but studies think a lot of people tend to do one or the other, probably a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Disproportionately.	CHITCHAT
But I know that whole study thing was a big thing.	CHITCHAT
With the online community I was kind of part of at the time.	CHITCHAT
It's very big on.	CHITCHAT
Kind of pushing yourself, doing studies and trying to get better.	CHITCHAT

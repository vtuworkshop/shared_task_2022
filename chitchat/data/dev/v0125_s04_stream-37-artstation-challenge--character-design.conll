I think some people got into the habit of doing like nothing but studies and.	CHITCHAT
Kind of kind of allows you to lose your.	CHITCHAT
The idea is that are supposed to be for front.	CHITCHAT
And I feel like that's something I consider a bit of my weakness right now.	CHITCHAT
Is.	CHITCHAT
Feel like I'm really trying to focus on my ideas being better.	CHITCHAT
That's not to say this this project is a great example of that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I still feel like my ideas for this project or a little underwhelming.	CHITCHAT
But something I'm aware of it so that I'm thinking about.	CHITCHAT
So you guys can get some emergency vehicles coming through.	CHITCHAT
What's up, Wolf?	CHITCHAT
How you doing, man?	CHITCHAT
Making poses loose poses in the right ways, and not goofy looking as an art form in itself.	O
Yeah, well, there's several aspects to poses and I remember when I was first really getting into figure drawing.	CHITCHAT
Will drawing in general what I focused on was figure drawing, head drawing and all that stuff 'cause I wanted to draw people.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I got decent at anatomy.	CHITCHAT
I got decent at structure.	CHITCHAT
And I don't mean awesome, I mean decent.	CHITCHAT
But then I was a very well aware that my hoses were weak.	CHITCHAT
All my poses looked really stiff, mannequin like, not very full of life or believable.	CHITCHAT
So then I had to tackle that.	CHITCHAT
Problem was like, Oh man, why are my poses stiff now it was pointed out to me by more than one person.	CHITCHAT
It's like Dang OK, well I gotta do something about that.	CHITCHAT
So then I realized like will gesture is just as important like.	CHITCHAT
Sure, you can make an arm look 3D and you can make a leg look 3D and you can draw a figure in perspective.	O
But if nobody actually stands like that, you know if it supposed that no real person would take 'cause, it's unnatural and it's not comfortable, and that's not how the body moves.	O
I kind of failed, right?	CHITCHAT
Sure, you made that weird, awkward, lifeless posed look 3D, but it doesn't look good.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
So that was kind of the thing I realized after that.	CHITCHAT
And there's always something like I said, I'm I'm really trying to.	CHITCHAT
Focus on ideas a bit lately, or at least I'm made aware of it, so I'm trying to take some steps towards that.	CHITCHAT
I don't think my.	CHITCHAT
Stuff is great.	CHITCHAT
I'm really afraid of my stuff just being super dull and generic, and I think it is to some degree, but I think I'm I'm taking some steps to.	CHITCHAT
Get out of that.	O
Whoa.	CHITCHAT
Control F jeez, I didn't mean to hit that.	CHITCHAT
It does something.	CHITCHAT
Try to control D.	O
It's like it's a concept artist, you know.	CHITCHAT
Your whole job is the ideas.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't matter if an idea is well rendered, the bad idea.	CHITCHAT
No one, no one cares if it's bad design.	CHITCHAT
No one cares that something I'm like.	CHITCHAT
Oh that might be Maine.	CHITCHAT
That might be main, so gotta.	CHITCHAT
And this isn't, I would have to preface these things 'cause I think sometimes people think I'm.	CHITCHAT
Pooping on my own work.	CHITCHAT
I am not.	CHITCHAT
This is just the.	CHITCHAT
This is just the state of being an artist or trying to get better at any craft.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't have to be.	CHITCHAT
Art is just trying to identify what you don't like, what you want to prove it.	CHITCHAT
And do it.	CHITCHAT
I guess that's I guess that's the thing that it should specify is.	CHITCHAT
5% like I'm down in my work.	CHITCHAT
The way I think of it is not.	CHITCHAT
What are my bad ads?	CHITCHAT
Which which is is the case true too?	CHITCHAT
But it's what do I want to get better at?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's like glass, half full half empty type of way of looking at it like when I see stuff so bad in my work I'm not like oh this is bad I'm like oh I want to get better at this you know like if you had if you had a 5 out of 10 it's like pump to bring it up to a 5.8 you know if I get better at gestures man I could get a 5.8 that's exciting when you had a 5.8 you want to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to take it out more and be like, oh, I think I know how to get to a 6.5 by up this part of my game.	CHITCHAT
Looks like opportunity.	CHITCHAT
That's a bad analogy though, 'cause There's no top rating, there's No 10.	CHITCHAT

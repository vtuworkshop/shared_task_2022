You just keep going.	CHITCHAT
He had 10.	CHITCHAT
You can still get to 11.	CHITCHAT
Still get to 12.	CHITCHAT
There's no cap.	CHITCHAT
But you get what I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
If this is never had, a huge emotional attachment to my own work in terms of like being precious about it.	CHITCHAT
I think people can, you know.	CHITCHAT
Paid on my work.	CHITCHAT
Are states of things really bad?	CHITCHAT
Needs to be improved in?	CHITCHAT
Don't really care that much 'cause I know it needs to be improved and I want to get better.	CHITCHAT
And I know the work I'm doing today is worse than the work I'll be doing two months from now, even if it's just.	CHITCHAT
Slight differences.	CHITCHAT
How you doing?	CHITCHAT
By the way, Wolf, I don't know if I said hey, I think I did.	CHITCHAT
That's going on that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I definitely said hey but didn't ask you how you doing.	CHITCHAT
How's your weekend going?	CHITCHAT
How was your 4th?	CHITCHAT
Using references helps me in building that imagine of muscle memory absolutely that visual library, right?	O
The more you deal with any given subject, the more you're going to understand it, so the more you, let's say drawn arm, you're going to become more and more familiar with the structure of that arm.	O
The big shapes, the nuans, you know the nuances.	O
Maybe like you draw arms enough that you know what they look like, flexed and straighten out when the muscles are in different states of tenseness.	O
The thing is, like you get pretty good and you can draw that stuff from your head, but whenever you do that and you don't use any reference, you no longer adding to that knowledge, right?	O
You just kind of going off of the knowledge you have.	O
You're not putting any new info in your head, so even if you know how to draw these things, and I'm telling myself This as much as I'm saying it to anyone else, like as much as you know how to draw an arm if you.	O
Reference that arm even after you drew it yourself.	O
You can fix little things or add little nuanced pieces of info in there that are going to look better.	O
That you may have not done otherwise.	O
So this arm.	O
Yeah, that's kind of the difference.	O
Little bit more realistic.	O
His hands maybe like a little too.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Well too blocky.	O
I like angles, but.	O
For her maybe.	O
Smoothing it out just a bit.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, anyway so.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of good to.	O
Keep that knowledge flowing.	O
Use those references you know.	O
They always gonna help.	O
Put a shower.	O

You do anything or is my computer just lagging my computer just lagging?	CHITCHAT
I get paranoid a lot now.	CHITCHAT
Electronics are going to rebel against Maine.	CHITCHAT
Part of the computer uprising.	CHITCHAT
I could be said about all different things you do.	CHITCHAT
To painting if its product multiple arts but nicely in balance with each other, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Jesters, arguably arguably the most important part of drawing figures.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's it's all that stuff coming together.	CHITCHAT
Gotta have a good sense of depth and construction for that gesture to look good, you know.	CHITCHAT
What would be really bad if you can tell that your artwork that you where it could be improved?	CHITCHAT
Because it's?	CHITCHAT
How would you ever know improve?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and I mean, as far as I can tell, you know, the more you draw, the more you release.	CHITCHAT
Trying to be an analytical, the more you're able to develop your AI.	CHITCHAT
That's never been something I've had to consciously do.	CHITCHAT
It's just like it seems to be automatic.	CHITCHAT
The more you draw, the more you get a critical eye, the more you understand when things look off.	CHITCHAT
But Yeah, that's like my biggest fear is that I would never stop improving.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't actually believe there's any reason that would happen, but I feel like you do have to put in effort forth.	CHITCHAT
You have to be trying to identify weakness in your work.	CHITCHAT
You have to be trying to understand, like what do I need to do to take my work to that next level?	CHITCHAT
That really just comes from identifying what you don't like about your work, which you know isn't a negative thing.	CHITCHAT
That's just you trying to find that puzzle piece to take it to that next level.	CHITCHAT
That's why I'm excited to find things that are wrong with my work, 'cause I'm like, oh next time I can try this, then see if that works.	CHITCHAT
Didn't really do anything for the fourth, yeah, I mean everything is pretty much canceled this year, right?	CHITCHAT
Or fireworks going off where you're at, like 24/7 was crazy man.	CHITCHAT
Fireworks are going off here a lot in general, but last night understandably was more, but it was like 2 hours.	CHITCHAT
Man like 2 hours of nonstop like.	CHITCHAT
I'm not even exaggerating.	CHITCHAT
I swear it was like 2 hours of no bits of silence.	CHITCHAT
Just constant pop, pop, pop, pop, boom, boom, pop, pop boom, boom.	CHITCHAT
Next hit hit song.	CHITCHAT
Drawing circles ovals there challenging but I'd like to.	O
I'd like to be a better draftsman.	O
Yeah, that muscle memory.	O
This arm.	O
I bet if I referenced it would be better.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
There's just too long.	O
It looks like 2 simplified.	O
I don't know, it's photoshopped.	O
That's weird, What is this?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm just crazy.	CHITCHAT
Probably a little crazy.	CHITCHAT
Ricks design, thank you by the way, I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that's how you say it arcade TS.	CHITCHAT
Just want to say Rex.	CHITCHAT
Work.	O
Turn down.	O
Something about this Catholics off to me.	CHITCHAT

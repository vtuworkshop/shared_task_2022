Your level of zoom is like an automatic.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Determiner of how loose your painting is going to be.	O
So I kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Try to keep a certain level of zoom so I automatically don't get too tight.	O
Same thing like even more so with painting mask and the lovely you draw from.	O
Definitely.	CHITCHAT
Effects that, but more specifically when I'm painting.	O
I usually stay zoomed out around here.	O
Allow myself to see the full thing.	O
But I do have to keep it in mind when I'm doing these things, 'cause sometimes when I'm drawing like I am definitely conditioned to stay zoomed out when I paint.	O
But sometimes when I'm drawing doing a line drawing or even a mask like this.	O
I can forget and I've caught myself taking way too long now this I'm definitely zoomed in more, but I want I want the shapes to be pretty accurate.	O
I just don't need them to be.	O
Pixel perfect or anything?	O
You'll notice when I take these off it, the edges don't look beautiful, which which is fine.	O
'cause when I go over later and I'm painting it up, I'll be adjusting those edges.	O
So what I'm actually painting up the hand, that's when I'll refine those edges a little bit more.	O
But the good part is this is never.	CHITCHAT
It's not like once I do this, I can't edit edit it anymore, can always go back and.	O
Redo the line drawing or add to it.	O
All that stuff.	O
Nothing's ever like locked in.	O
He still drawing on your iPad pro a lot.	CHITCHAT
I haven't been very much lately to be honest I.	CHITCHAT
I want you a little bit more and I want to get used to painting on it more.	CHITCHAT
But I haven't actually in a little bit.	CHITCHAT
It's been awhile, not as much lately.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how much of that has to do with the fact that I haven't been leaving the house nearly as much.	CHITCHAT
Not that I do a lot anyway, but.	CHITCHAT
Like if I'm doing a finished piece like these where I'm really working and do it.	CHITCHAT
I just I don't transfer it over to my iPad.	CHITCHAT
I just want to keep it in Photoshop, 'cause you know?	CHITCHAT
Comfortable with this, but I do like using it for if I'm starting something new.	CHITCHAT
I just want to sketch around.	CHITCHAT
I think it's good for that, but.	CHITCHAT
Need to practice with it more so I can kind of do anything on it.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I think we're done.	O
Yeah, it looks like we're pretty good, so.	O
And the selected with the magic wand tool.	O
Uncheck sample all layers.	O
On check, check on contiguous there we go.	O
Now I can just get the inside there.	O
Select expand the selection by a few pixels.	O
Four pixels now.	O
Should just be able to double tap to fill it in there yet.	O
So there's our mask looking good, I'm happy with it.	O
Now we can do a.	O

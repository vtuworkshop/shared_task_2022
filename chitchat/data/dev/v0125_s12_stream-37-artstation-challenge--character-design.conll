Flats layer on top called flat colors and this is.	O
It's basically the part where.	O
I workout with the colour scheme is also it's.	O
Good way to do?	CHITCHAT
Whoops There we go.	CHITCHAT
This is a good way to have.	O
Nice clean selections.	O
I need that if I want that.	O
And of course, the whole point of making the mask is so I can create a clipping mask.	O
Let's go ahead and click that on.	O
There we go, beautiful.	O
So the nice thing about having these thumbnails?	O
Is that I can just?	O
Know what colors I need?	O
I can always change it, but.	O
I very well may change it as well, but.	O
Just to get at least an idea good starting point.	O
Uh, what do you make an action for that when you feel it?	O
I guess would it be the action after?	O
After the magic wand magic wand, and then I would.	O
Select expand Phil.	O
I mean, that's only it's only a few steps and I do it once a painting I guess so.	O
That I mean, I literally haven't thought about it, 'cause I've only used this method of doing it like couple times.	CHITCHAT
It's only the past like characters so that I've even started doing flat colors again.	CHITCHAT
It's weird 'cause I have this like nervousness surrounding the flag colors.	CHITCHAT
Like, no, that was my old method and I changed for a reason.	CHITCHAT
But it's like.	CHITCHAT
It's easy to get too caught up in something silly that doesn't matter.	CHITCHAT
You do it if it's sufficient.	CHITCHAT
My processes changed in multiple ways, not just the flat colors, but anyway, yeah, the flag colors themselves is kind of a new thing I've been doing again.	CHITCHAT
Would like proper clipping mask.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't even doing that completely.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
That's one reason.	CHITCHAT
It wouldn't have even made sense until now.	CHITCHAT
But something to think about.	CHITCHAT
It's interesting how many different workflows that are for digital art.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, for sure.	CHITCHAT
Maybe if you're drawing a big scene in action, yeah?	CHITCHAT
It doesn't really slow you down.	CHITCHAT
Yeah exactly.	CHITCHAT
It's once you start doing things multiple times, or unless you have like this really complicated process that you just do once every character.	CHITCHAT
But it takes a long time.	CHITCHAT
If you could share that with actions, that's probably a very smart thing to do, so it's kind of like using hotkeys fuse any.	CHITCHAT
Tool a lot.	CHITCHAT
Just worthwhile to learn the hotkeys.	CHITCHAT
By that usually comes with repetition.	CHITCHAT
The necessity for it.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, well, if I don't know if I don't know about stream since I I ended my last stream of roughly if anyone else is here and you guys didn't know during my twitch stream.	CHITCHAT
The cat jumped out the window that's behind my monitors and somehow I didn't even notice.	CHITCHAT
But I keep the blind shut to keep the light out.	CHITCHAT
There's a hole in the screen that was getting pretty sizable.	CHITCHAT
And I guess he like kind of squeeze through the hole and ripped it like all the way down to the bottom.	CHITCHAT
and I didn't even realize that he jumped out the window, were on the second story of this building.	CHITCHAT
So I ended my stream very abruptly.	CHITCHAT
On Twitch I ran down to go see if we could find him.	CHITCHAT

As soon as I noticed or my girlfriend pointed it out, like where is he and we look the window, it was ripped open in our neighbors roof, down outside.	CHITCHAT
Have you guys seen a cat like yeah and orange one?	CHITCHAT
I'm like Yup like yeah he went down that way so I ran out of this room.	CHITCHAT
None of our cats or outdoor cats.	CHITCHAT
And I was running around barefoot 'cause I sounded like he and just been there.	CHITCHAT
So I don't want to waste.	CHITCHAT
Happening Crazy, never mind, ignore me.	CHITCHAT
And I want to waste time putting on shoes.	CHITCHAT
If you had just been out there and man, I don't know about you guys, but I always wear shoes.	CHITCHAT
I never go outside without shoes so my feet are like babies feed and it's crazy just from running a little bit like I ran down or they said he was find them and then I was walking around for a bit barefoot until I came up here shut down my stream and put my shoes on to go look some more but do my feet are like messed up like on the balls of my feet.	CHITCHAT
There's like this Patch like that big of just really, really dark red skin.	CHITCHAT
And it's like kind of got.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's gonna blister, but I was looking at the first day I happened to look like, oh, that those are blisters.	CHITCHAT
Their crazy just from like running a little bit outside is my feet are so soft baby like.	CHITCHAT
Need to train him.	CHITCHAT
Need to go outside more without shoes.	CHITCHAT
Tough in these feet up.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
I'm uh.	CHITCHAT
Getting away from the point of the story to talk about my feet.	CHITCHAT
Every stream is devolves into that.	CHITCHAT
So yesterday.	CHITCHAT
We went to the store or the day before or something.	CHITCHAT
We went to the store, picked up some screen from hardware store like A roll of windows screen.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's expensive to get him replaced professionally.	CHITCHAT
He's like 40 Bucks a window 5040 something a window.	CHITCHAT
So I looked up how to do it and it's really easy.	CHITCHAT
So I replaced through the windows so this screen book behind me, now fresh brand new screen on it.	CHITCHAT
The same thing with one of the ones in the.	CHITCHAT
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Kitchen.	CHITCHAT
So that way I felt accomplished.	CHITCHAT
It's partially I spent my 4th of July.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunate feet thing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the bummer.	CHITCHAT
It's whatever.	CHITCHAT
It's not that bad.	CHITCHAT
I can walk around without too much discomfort.	CHITCHAT
Luckily, I think they're healing.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if they're actually going to blister or not.	CHITCHAT
I'm starting to think that they won't.	CHITCHAT
They don't seem as bad as it could be like the day after.	CHITCHAT
It seemed pretty bad the first day.	CHITCHAT
Who knows, who cares?	CHITCHAT
Lesson learned.	CHITCHAT
So what I get for having baby feet, you know?	CHITCHAT
That's on Main.	CHITCHAT
Should I wouldn't go without shoes I have to wear shoes.	CHITCHAT
That's why I love him so much.	CHITCHAT
You know I depend on them.	CHITCHAT
She never, never not wear shoes.	CHITCHAT
That's why is the shoe guy.	CHITCHAT
It's not the barefoot guy.	CHITCHAT
'cause you can't happy to see you.	CHITCHAT
Um, I didn't find him.	CHITCHAT
So me, my girlfriend and my girlfriend sister who is staying over just for a day or so.	CHITCHAT
She was there so I was running down further.	CHITCHAT
There's this one set of houses where it's kind of like.	CHITCHAT
It goes inward into this yard and there's a bunch of am I don't know if they're called townhouses or whatever, but I was looking kind of in their yard area.	CHITCHAT
Their shared little yard 'cause it seems like an area cat would try to go.	CHITCHAT

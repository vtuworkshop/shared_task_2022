And then I kind of looked around and then when I looked around going back onto my street, I saw my girlfriend running, so I assume that means she saw him.	CHITCHAT
So I started running.	CHITCHAT
And when I got there, he was up against our building.	CHITCHAT
Our neighbors said he was like a house or two down like near their front yard.	CHITCHAT
So I guess he came back.	CHITCHAT
But um.	CHITCHAT
I saw her running, so I ran down in.	CHITCHAT
My girlfriend's sister had like found him and was kind of like boxing him in and he was up against the building behind like some potted plants.	CHITCHAT
So he was kind of hunkered down there and he was.	CHITCHAT
He was just hissing at her like I don't know what it is.	CHITCHAT
He's a sweet cat.	CHITCHAT
He doesn't mind people.	CHITCHAT
He's he's kinda silly like he tries to act like he's like he doesn't want attention and he's too cool but he's never like hisses at people, but for some reason my girlfriend's sister.	CHITCHAT
He hates her man.	CHITCHAT
Like as soon as she got here and this is happened before he starts hissing and being really mean and he even like swatted out here once and he never does that so so bizarre.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea why he acts that way to hurry.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, she found him, so he was not happy so he was like raw but I just grabbed him out.	CHITCHAT
Kind of angry at him.	CHITCHAT
And so, like I had to get getting beneath his cactus type thing next to some plans.	CHITCHAT
So I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't even want to play games with him.	CHITCHAT
He was kind of like growling at me too.	CHITCHAT
Just growling at anyone near him.	CHITCHAT
So I just scrubbed him and picked him up, put him over my shoulder and took him inside.	CHITCHAT
He doesn't like being held so he's like fidgeting and trying to get away.	CHITCHAT
But I'm like don't even try.	CHITCHAT
Don't even don't even test me right now.	CHITCHAT
Would go without shoes gacha.	CHITCHAT
So my girlfriend was not not super pleased with Maine.	CHITCHAT
Loving the cat get out.	CHITCHAT
On my watch.	CHITCHAT
In this room where we know there's a big hole, but I didn't actually think he would ever.	CHITCHAT
Jump and I thought he had left the room.	CHITCHAT
So lesson learned, so that's what prompted the screen replacement.	CHITCHAT
It's good now to change the screen in a window.	CHITCHAT
Pretty simple, though it did take awhile.	CHITCHAT
It was quite a bit of effort to cut the screen.	CHITCHAT
Fit it.	CHITCHAT
Cut it off, cut off the excess.	CHITCHAT
It definitely took awhile for how simple it is.	CHITCHAT
So it would be nice if this was a house we actually had a house.	CHITCHAT
You feel better about repairing stuff in the actual house you on.	CHITCHAT
Not quite as much from apartment you're renting.	CHITCHAT
Suede until all that she got money starts rolling in though, Yeah.	CHITCHAT

Hum.	CHITCHAT
Fully PCs would make the room cooler.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's like I've thought for a long time that it was these monitors on my computer and the lights all being on.	CHITCHAT
But like on days where I don't use this computer like a Saturday where I'm out in the other room all day, I'll walk in here and they'll still be super hot.	CHITCHAT
Snap, not fun.	CHITCHAT
The hottest room in the House of course.	CHITCHAT
'cause why wouldn't it be?	CHITCHAT
Think it's whatever room you workin just will automatically be no matter what the hottest room in the house.	CHITCHAT
The universe being a jerk.	CHITCHAT
Don't even think about it beeps so man if she comes up on my lap, I'm going to get like twice as hot but she's so fluffy.	CHITCHAT
Remember, she comes and sits on my lap while I work after like 5 minutes.	CHITCHAT
My body heat is increased so much because I love you, but I don't want to sit on me right now.	CHITCHAT
YouTube fluffy.	CHITCHAT
Just two gosh Dang fluffy.	CHITCHAT
Beep.	CHITCHAT
Beep.	CHITCHAT
The beautiful song beeps.	CHITCHAT
You said it sister, Uh Oh, she's up on my lap.	CHITCHAT
Or does she want as she's lying down?	CHITCHAT
How are you going to be like this when it's this hot?	CHITCHAT
Speech guys can't really see her too well.	CHITCHAT
What's that?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, let me see here.	CHITCHAT
Get some color variation.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Men taking longer than I thought it would.	CHITCHAT
I always hate these songs that have this weird high pitched voice.	CHITCHAT
Like Why is that a thing?	CHITCHAT
Can you even tell me why this is a thing in music?	CHITCHAT
This is used a little bit differently.	CHITCHAT
It's not the best example.	CHITCHAT
This just sounds like normal like song with like high pitched, but there's a lot of those technologies songs where they use it, like little bits and pieces here won't be like a verse like they're singing a whole verse.	CHITCHAT
It'll be like little sound effects of that type of voice.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why it's like a thing like so many people use it.	CHITCHAT
But it's like so weird.	CHITCHAT
When did that become a popular staple of music?	CHITCHAT
I never hear it really.	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't listen to that type of music.	CHITCHAT
I think it's usually like in more technology type music which I never listen to, but.	CHITCHAT
Not a fan.	CHITCHAT
Wait, if you're still there, I think originally had this thought when I was looking for music to play here on.	CHITCHAT
Be hands it's Copyright free and it's like when I was looking for Copyright free music.	CHITCHAT
A lot of those songs had that type of stuff in it.	CHITCHAT

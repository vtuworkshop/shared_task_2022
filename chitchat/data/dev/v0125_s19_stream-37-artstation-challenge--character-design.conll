What is this?	CHITCHAT
The area around her neck?	O
I think it's supposed to be people as well.	O
Let's get that, and then we'll do this little gold trim and then we should be just about ready to paint, though I'm wondering if I should take a quick break to get a snack.	O
I literally like right before I came online here right before I started streaming.	CHITCHAT
I'm like hungry.	CHITCHAT
Like in the way that it's kind of like bugging me.	CHITCHAT
Now, like I could eat something but like.	CHITCHAT
Become uncomfortable and they need to go get a snack, which is strange.	CHITCHAT
That would be that quick.	CHITCHAT
The Heat.	CHITCHAT
Now it can't be.	CHITCHAT
Like that feeling, I need to run the end of streams and I haven't eaten for a bit.	CHITCHAT
So doing the flat colors in this way is kind of annoying.	O
But It's paid off so far like it's worked out fairly well.	O
Separating these sections fairly cleanly.	O
So this one I think he just has a lot of little shapes and things going on.	O
So it's like more noticeable.	O
It's taking awhile.	CHITCHAT
But I'm kind of hoping the same thing that it'll pay off and I'll be like, yeah, that was.	CHITCHAT
Could use my time.	CHITCHAT
I'm really just trying to get more efficient get faster.	CHITCHAT
So always open trying out a slight workflow adjustment.	CHITCHAT
To see.	CHITCHAT
And again, like I used to do flat colors all the time, but it was also back in the time where I feel like I just took way too long to do things 'cause I would do flat and it just wasn't as fun painting that way, paying a lot more loosely now.	CHITCHAT
But now I'm kind of most merging the two.	O
'cause I used to do flat colors and then I would like to do a really clean mask.	O
Really clean flat colors and then really clean multiply layer then color Dodge layer and all these separate layers to build up my thing.	O
But right now it's just like.	O
Mask and flat colors and then.	O
I don't do a separate layer for shadows and all that, just get into it right?	O
Some is not making sense here.	O
Oh maybe that there we go.	O
Lock that mass clear again.	O
This hair in.	O
I think will be pretty good.	O
I'm missing anything, anything obvious?	CHITCHAT
And you can see these flat colors definitely aren't perfect, but they don't need to be.	O
Says I owe yeah and one thing, it wasn't sure.	CHITCHAT
The other the other model doesn't have bracers.	O
This one she does, but I don't know if I was actually going to do it 'cause I kind of liked it without but.	O
It's hard to tell in this piece.	O
Actually, that looks kind of cool.	O
I think I think I like that.	O
Noticeably better.	O
Yeah, I kind of like how it mirrors the boots.	O
It mirrors that Brown of the boots.	O
It takes it up into the.	O
Upper area the design.	O
In the same way that it's kind of in the middle of the belts, you know, maybe we could even do another builds.	O
Yeah, I like that.	O

Crazy how that works.	CHITCHAT
All Right, This is why I don't like having the door open.	CHITCHAT
Alright buddy, I'm gonna kick you off.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry I love you.	CHITCHAT
He's been Sony today so I feel really bad but.	CHITCHAT
I can't work with them like that.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, now he's back up.	CHITCHAT
Kind of a few streams people were away.	CHITCHAT
Ha, crazy coincidence.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm gonna have to shut him out of the room.	CHITCHAT
Alright buddy, I really gotta work.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry I love you.	CHITCHAT
We gotta go.	CHITCHAT
Say bye to everybody.	CHITCHAT
He's gonna be fussy about it.	CHITCHAT
Hello everybody.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Been taking longer than I feel like this should have taken.	CHITCHAT
But you know, whatever it is, what it is.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to paint this now.	O
Basically go from this pretty clean flat colors.	O
Just trying to save it.	O
And then block some of this stuff and.	O
So let's just start with the skin.	O
When I have these settings, I can go to the flag color layer.	O
I take away this my camera blocks it.	O
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Well, I guess I do that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Actually was I even trying to show you there?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, if I click my flag color layer.	O
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
Why isn't that working?	CHITCHAT
For that guess those are different shades of white.	O
Weird, anyway, if I select the skin with contiguous unchecked at the very top of the magic wand tool.	O
And sample layers unchecked as well.	O
I'm over the flat color layer.	O
Contain just in there so.	O
Who is this?	CHITCHAT
Oh paintings to be clipped.	O
Silly me, there we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is kind of what I've been doing lately.	O
And these are these past couple characters have been basically getting my flat color layers roughed in.	O
And then I.	O
Paint on a new layer and I just try to do with big brush strokes.	O
Big loose shapes turn on my.	O
Line layer whenever I need guidance on what I should be painting.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And having this separated colors, this is when it pays off.	O
You can just make these selections and it allows me to basically do these big brush strokes.	O
Without interference.	O
From a.	O
The other shapes and colors.	O
So the clipping mask keeps.	O
Keeps the whole thing in view for Maine, or I'm sorry the whole thing.	O

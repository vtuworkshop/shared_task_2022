My bound box disappears after wait for a chain.	O
Oh weird.	CHITCHAT
So that you're having some issues in both programs.	CHITCHAT
So frustrating, yeah.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I haven't had issues for a long time, but then when I updated the last one I've had some issues so.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about seeing if I can update again.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if there's been an update since my last update.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But if there was, I was thinking about updating again.	CHITCHAT
See if that fixes it.	CHITCHAT
'cause it actually last time I updated it cause more problems and the time before that was the first time that it caused problems.	CHITCHAT
So if it's still bad, I may consider just reverting to the.	CHITCHAT
Past version I had.	CHITCHAT
'cause that was working flawlessly for a long time.	CHITCHAT
And I don't think there's any like updates that.	CHITCHAT
A crucial for me.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of little glitches that are kind of frustrating even when I click on a new layer to select a new layer.	O
Seems like half though it's not doing it now, but it seems like half the time.	O
It's.	CHITCHAT
It double clicks it.	O
Basically it acts like I double clicked which is very irritating because it will.	O
Start trying to rename the layer.	O
Open a dialog box when I'm just trying to quickly switch between layers.	O
We'll see, we'll give it and updating.	CHITCHAT
See what happens.	CHITCHAT
Take it from there.	O
Think we should definitely get some form in the hair.	O
Basically, as you can see, what I'm doing is just jumping from selection selection to try to rough in.	O
Some good.	O
Good overall.	O
Form.	O
Even if it's just like.	O
Basic starting point.	O
Trying to get some like general gradients across the form.	O
It would be fairly angular with my brush strokes to.	O
Kind of define edge is a little bit more clearly.	O
More definitively.	O
I want to be very definitive about like where.	O
Planes of this object are whatever I'm painting.	O
And I want to do a lot of like.	O
Ambiguous shading want to really determine which direction the lights coming from.	O

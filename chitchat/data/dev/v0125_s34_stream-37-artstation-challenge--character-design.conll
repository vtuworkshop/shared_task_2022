I'm doing the character portion of that challenge, and, um.	CHITCHAT
There's six characters you're supposed to do based off a certain.	CHITCHAT
Word.	CHITCHAT
I like characteristic for each character which is.	CHITCHAT
Let me well let me pop it up so it makes a little bit more sense.	CHITCHAT
Here's my artstation page.	CHITCHAT
Here's my challenge page.	CHITCHAT
If you guys want to check out the progress so far on this challenge, you can go there.	CHITCHAT
Let me put the same message twice to do it that way then.	CHITCHAT
So you can see that this story in the description behind the characters.	O
This is the little story behind the characters.	O
And then there's a description of who each character is within that group.	O
But you're supposed to use six characteristics, design A character based off each one, so from left to right into the series character.	O
Brave, joyful.	O
Miss Chievous, which were doing now wild and leader.	O
So the monster guys, the joyful character he's the diplomat between the two realms.	O
In the story.	O
She is an illusionist and Sabbath Tour.	O
She's kind of there too.	O
Foil any plans to find the second realm.	O
So this was the series characters costumes that we did.	O
Oh wait, I think it's probably cutting these off a little bit for you guys actually know because it's showing the other way.	O
Yeah sorry, that's cut off awkwardly when I was trying to.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So those are the six characters and then all the costumes have been posted on this page.	O
And now I'm posting the workups the rough workups of each character so that the wild character costumes the leader.	O
And then this is a serious character, Ruffin, we're doing the Ruffin of every character now.	O
Ruffin of the brave character.	O
Who's the spy of the group?	O
He Ruffin of the diplomat joyful character.	O

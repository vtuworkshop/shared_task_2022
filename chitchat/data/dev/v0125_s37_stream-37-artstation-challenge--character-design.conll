I've been a streaming longer than I intended to.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
I've had this cheese, I'm sorry guys.	CHITCHAT
I've been painting this whole time after it should do the cat.	CHITCHAT
It's probably been a few minutes that I've been doing that I do that all the time.	CHITCHAT
I minimized oh BS to do something.	CHITCHAT
The agency that firework I minimize OBS to do something.	CHITCHAT
And then I didn't realize I don't know whatever you guys missed.	CHITCHAT
I've been painting the hair.	O
I think I just saved it.	O
Yeah, so I can't revert to show you what I did but.	O
I don't think you missed too much of that, but I was working up that her and before that the face.	O
But I think you saw the face working up.	O
So anyway, that's where we are with that.	O
This is how it's looking.	O
So far.	O
Hope you guys think it's turning out OK.	CHITCHAT
But Still got quite a bit of work to do, that's why it's a weird Little.	CHITCHAT
Fix this flat color daily.	O
Selected a slightly different shade of white and it looked kind of weird.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So that's where we are.	CHITCHAT
I gotta jump off.	CHITCHAT
I went like an extra hour.	CHITCHAT
I just really want to rough that character in and.	O
This is the hand, yet the hand fulls there, so this is the last character we did.	O
This was the joyful character.	O
We've been working on the mischievious character an Next up we will do the Hunter character.	O
So once again, if you guys haven't seen it, you can check it out on my artstation.	CHITCHAT
If you go to challenges.	CHITCHAT
I put this in the chat, but I'll do it again in case anyone just popped in in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if the chat loads old chat, I think it does right.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So these are the rough and characters that I posted so far.	CHITCHAT
But the next character that we're going to do is the dice a Hunter.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I said that wild character.	CHITCHAT
I've been thinking of this character in my head is the Hunter for some reason.	CHITCHAT
Lately I keep throwing myself off, but, uh, the wild character of the group.	CHITCHAT
So I think the costume I liked the most for this one is.	CHITCHAT
I think it was the top second from left, this one with the moose antlers.	CHITCHAT
I think I like that one.	CHITCHAT
We may play with that a little bit, but, uh.	CHITCHAT
That's the character after the mischievous character, and then after this.	O
Actually we're good 'cause we already roughed in the leader character, which.	O
Maybe I can show you 'cause I haven't pop that open or I don't have it up on that challenge post yet.	CHITCHAT
Leader box of mystery.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is the leader character as her ruffin.	O
So that's where we are with that one.	O
And yeah, after these are all roughed in around the same amount, I'm just going to go through and kind of clean him up and finish him so this character is a little, I think, still a little bit rough.	O
I want to clean some areas up.	O
For sure, the next step is basically to merge this character down.	O
To merge her into one layer in that way, I can kind of control the edges as much as I want with the hair.	O
The hair looks like really ugly right now, 'cause there's no soft edges.	O
But Once we can get the face worked up like these eyes to look a little bit more natural.	O
And the hair and everything else just polished a little bit.	O
I think this character will be any good spot.	O
So what I plan on doing tomorrow is working on the wild character.	CHITCHAT
And I'll probably work on her at the beginning of my Twitch stream, but I think by the time I'm doing my be hand stream, it's going to only be the wild character that I just showed you.	CHITCHAT
That's the goal, and then I can get the wild character by a good spot tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I think will be.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's gonna be tough 'cause tomorrow is actually the last week, so this challenge getting it in on time by the deadline which is July.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
July 13th, yeah, we're idiot.	CHITCHAT

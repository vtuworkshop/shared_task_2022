July 5th.	CHITCHAT
So one week from tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
So I will have the weekend, which may be my saving Grace will see.	CHITCHAT
That light kind of coming from the right there.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Can make your looks so crazy just with those peoples.	CHITCHAT
Now what I'm doing, don't worry.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we'll call it there.	O
Like I said, I stream on Twitch as well four to five days a week.	CHITCHAT
Overall, I stream between B, Hansen, Twitch.	CHITCHAT
I stream five days a week, few times each day or few times on some of the days.	CHITCHAT
Monday, Wednesday, Friday are my strings here on be hands and then Monday through Friday stream on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I take Wednesday off for that, but I'll be on stream on Wednesdays regardless.	CHITCHAT
So if you do want to keep up with me, be Hans is a great place to do it.	CHITCHAT
You're here already.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys want to follow, I post art heerenveen hands and I stream off of here.	CHITCHAT
I also stream on Twitch usually around 11:30 or 12 Pacific Time here on V hands.	CHITCHAT
It's closer to 4:30 Pacific Time.	CHITCHAT
Today is kind of a random time.	CHITCHAT
Today I just streamed.	CHITCHAT
I don't typically stream on weekends at all, but I wanted to make up for the missed stream that I had on Friday.	CHITCHAT
Twitch, Twitter, Instagram and be hands are the best ways to keep up with me in general.	CHITCHAT
Twitter I was posted.	CHITCHAT
I'm going live on either streaming platform in any art I have to share anything cool I have to share?	CHITCHAT
Do their instagrams all art.	CHITCHAT
So that's a good place to keep up with sketches.	CHITCHAT
Finished pieces, all that art station and be hands and things like that are more finished pieces that I post.	CHITCHAT
But Instagram is a lot more of a sketchy stuff as well.	CHITCHAT
I've been doing some some warmups.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I have him with the the head sketches.	CHITCHAT
In the beginning of some streams, when I have a little time, so things like that, you'll find more on Instagram as well, but will be back tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, with a new character.	CHITCHAT
This one will work on as much as I'm able to, but it's decently Roughton right now.	CHITCHAT
Decently happy with it, I suppose, but we'll come back to all of these.	CHITCHAT
Of course, none of them are done, it's just the rough in.	CHITCHAT
And then this week this tomorrow basically that the week of that week of the 5th or the 6th whenever you count, the week is starting.	CHITCHAT
That's going to be pretty much just cleaning up all the characters, but we got one more after this one to Ruffin so.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully I can spend as much of this coming week.	CHITCHAT
Is possible to really get a lot of time to finish up these characters and make him look hopefully as good as I'd like them to be.	CHITCHAT
I think that's it.	CHITCHAT
The link should be down below.	CHITCHAT
I'm Sam Peterson art everywhere online, so if anything is not link down below, you should be able to just Google my name in the social media and you'll find me pretty easily that way.	CHITCHAT
Huge follow or huge follow huge thanks if you guys followed today.	CHITCHAT
If you guys knew the stream or anything like that I appreciate you guys hanging out with me.	CHITCHAT
Whether you are chatting or just lurking.	CHITCHAT
Like I said I'll be back for some more streaming will get a little further on this project and you guys have a good one.	CHITCHAT
Have a good rest of your Sunday.	CHITCHAT
I'll see you guys next time.	CHITCHAT
Thanks again.	CHITCHAT
Bye everybody.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT

Oh yeah, I think watercolors very hard to replicate for.	O
Digital.	O
Think traditional paintings.	O
OK, in fact, I'll find out because I'm going to go painting for the first time this Friday.	CHITCHAT
See how that goes.	CHITCHAT
I'm very curious to see if I could like bringing my traditional painting skills into.	CHITCHAT
Traditional.	CHITCHAT
Could be very fun.	CHITCHAT
Oh man, why is blue always looks so good?	O
Off then that's it.	O
That's an evil color right there.	O
Probably good contrast 'cause it's like the highlight colors yellow.	O
If I contrast that with like a purple, that's pretty good.	O
Open we're going to be using.	O
Hey, that's a question for future Jeff to handle.	CHITCHAT
OK, I don't know I'm going to have it's going to be like instructed so I'll just use water.	CHITCHAT
Using will probably most likely be.	CHITCHAT
I don't do that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I meant taking my digital painting skills into traditional.	CHITCHAT
See how that goes.	CHITCHAT
Do I have those colors on anywhere else?	CHITCHAT
I don't really have that kind of Purple E.	O
Yeah, I don't.	O
Or should I make it same color?	O
Or should I make it contrast?	O
What do you guys think?	CHITCHAT
Might be too many colours if I make it contrast right?	O
Like maybe you should stick more too.	O
Towards what I have already.	O
I'm a feeling I'll be using something quick that dries quickly what it is.	O
It's like it's not acrylic.	O
It's something else is in it.	O
The paint.	O
But you have a point about single.	O
Like pink Yeah, I think if I if I bring into many contrasting ones will be too much.	O
Especially if you look at what I have here.	CHITCHAT
I didn't have like.	CHITCHAT
I don't have to like, really.	CHITCHAT
Loud colors on each one at visit.	CHITCHAT
Many only one, so I think I'll just stick to 2 one here as well.	O
Which I think is more catching.	O
Gives more character.	O
Yeah, my concern is it might bring too much for this character compared to the other ones.	O
Since I am doing them as like a set.	O
So if I don't have that type of treatment for these guys it might be too much for her.	O
I think she probably lined them up as well.	O

My name is Jack.	CHITCHAT

I like a lot of things.	CHITCHAT
My shirt today says eat more Donuts so.	CHITCHAT
Uh, very on brand.	CHITCHAT
How to redo the chat?	CHITCHAT
I see that we've got Sergio and Corey's hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Sergio says he is doing fine working on new projects with my life guard.	CHITCHAT

I want to give a shout out to you, interpret and he let's me stream his music in the background.	CHITCHAT
My stream so you guys can enjoy his beeps and Boops while I work.	CHITCHAT
So if you like what you hear, go down the links to his work are in the description of my videos, always on SoundCloud.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, today we're going to be working on something a little fun.	CHITCHAT
Um, we're working on you.	CHITCHAT
Be hands live weekly, challenge the Livestreamers all.	CHITCHAT
Some of us were doing this weekly challenge.	CHITCHAT
The theme is Corentine Awards.	CHITCHAT
Switch over to my desktop view.	CHITCHAT
Ryan made this fancy.	CHITCHAT
Transition here so you guys will see it in there.	CHITCHAT
So I do this right.	CHITCHAT
So far that.	CHITCHAT
But we're working on this app that I have a little bit of work on.	CHITCHAT
Um morning, because it would have taken she probably my entire life to get through all of these icons that I want for this app.	CHITCHAT
So the theme is corentine awards mouse here.	CHITCHAT
Hello, how are you?	CHITCHAT
The thing that is Corentine Awards and what I decided to do is a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I guess a little bit off from the, it's not directly, it's not like it's roughly or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
It's not like a literal award.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to do something a little different, so I went with this app idea.	O
It's a cooking app.	O
I know, I know.	CHITCHAT
Everything I do is food related.	CHITCHAT
I get it.	CHITCHAT
It's fine so to another food app, but this one, uh, the working title is recipe for disaster.	CHITCHAT
I just love it.	CHITCHAT
I think it's perfect and we're going to be doing onboarding mean they'll be XP 'cause I think that that should be simple enough that I can hopefully get through it all in one kind of sitting.	CHITCHAT

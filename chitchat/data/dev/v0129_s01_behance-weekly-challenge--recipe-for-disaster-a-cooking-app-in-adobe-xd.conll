So I'm going to actually transition one more time.	O
See that fancy fancy transition again?	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to show you, uhm, I got my book sketchbook here.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
You guys can see, UM, This is why sort of outline plan for the quarantine cooking app idea here for all of the different elements that I want in this onboarding sort of.	CHITCHAT
This is how I start.	CHITCHAT
You'll notice there's not any drawing on this because that that's not I start with like a content outline, user journey kind of thing.	O
Thinking about like all the steps that a user would take to navigate through this onboarding experience in all of the different things they would encounter.	O
Along the way, and that's how I start.	O
And then after that we can get individual.	O
So That being said, I'm gonna switch back over my.	O
Again, see you guys can see that.	O
Now says that could be the title for my memoir recipe for disaster.	O
I mean, it's it's good.	CHITCHAT
It's a good one.	CHITCHAT
So I started working on some uh, sort of branding, and, uh, like I said, these icons for the different parts of this onboarding experience.	CHITCHAT
I wanted it to have kind of like a cooking.	CHITCHAT
A high end.	CHITCHAT
Sheffield, I thought it was.	CHITCHAT
I appreciated the humor in that idea.	CHITCHAT
So this is kind of where I started with the colours down here in this like idea for the sort of brand which is this recipe for disaster.	CHITCHAT
And something so far.	CHITCHAT
and I started putting together someday.	CHITCHAT
It really bare bones kind of screens in XD study of his onboarding app is that you will have like.	CHITCHAT
When they're a user using this app so.	CHITCHAT
Cooking apps in general, they kind of wind up a lot of them wind up in this Gray area where they don't really satisfy.	CHITCHAT
Their audience, and that is that you wind up with users who are really like home cooks like they like, have a lot of equipment.	CHITCHAT
They have a lot of ingredients and they don't feel like.	CHITCHAT
Recipe apps gonna go far enough to satisfy all their needs and then on the other option in the spectrum, you have people who are really not that chefs who don't have a lot of ingredients or cooking appliances and that kind of thing and they just feel overwhelmed by the experience.	CHITCHAT
So with this is kind of a kept.	CHITCHAT
It pretty bare bones for what I want to show, but also allow the option for you to add on to.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
Add on the the tools kind of thing.	O
So for this onboarding experience.	O
You're gonna give agreed with kind of four 4545 screens of the first one is going to be what sort of appliances do you have on hand?	O
What sortof?	O
What's the number of people in your household?	O
How many people before?	O
Do you have any food intolerances, dietary restrictions, etc.	O
And then what kind of basic equipments you have?	O
You have pots and pans.	O
You have a cast iron skillet baking sheets, all that kind of stuff, and based on the user selections that's going to build a profile so that the recipe search only calls recipes that use items that somebody has my kitchen currently.	O
So this is basically a very like broad picture.	O
And then we get into the rest research.	O
Uhm, I really like this idea.	CHITCHAT
I would just being like a blank a blank screen.	O
It just asks you like.	O
You know what are you cooking or like?	O
What what ingredients you have an you just kind of.	O
It's just a search box and you type in things right?	O
So you type in like I have I have.	O
Carrots and he had entered, adds carrots on the list.	O
Then I have this ingredient of that and you can add one, or you get a whole bunch of different ones and then you hit go and it just pulls recipes that use the ingredients that you've asked for and the based on your user profile.	O
That kind of stuff in your kitchen.	CHITCHAT
And that's the idea is that you are not like sifting through tons of options, it's just very to the point.	O
Like I have these items.	O
What can I make with them?	O
So my?	CHITCHAT
Plan is to do the on boarding for that at the end of this onboarding process, after the user gets through all of these questions.	O
So you're going to get up.	CHITCHAT
The idea is you're going to get a badge.	CHITCHAT
Because I wanted to tie it back into the Sortof Corentin Award idea.	CHITCHAT
So if you pick, uh, if you have a lot of kitchen equipment and you have a lot of supplies, then you'll get the prepared for you.	CHITCHAT

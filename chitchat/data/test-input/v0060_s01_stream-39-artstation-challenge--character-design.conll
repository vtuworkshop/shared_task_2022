It's due on July 13th, which is Monday.	O
So that gives me very little time to finish these up.	O
There all blocked in all six characters are blocked in all six or do on Monday, so it's pretty much taking the few few days I have in between then and now to try to finish them up.	O
I mean, I'm kind of giving myself.	O
You know the perception of like I have 3 three days to do it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.	O
That's two characters per day while I'm streaming.	O
So not not a ton of time, but we'll see what we can do.	O
Let's see what we can make happen.	O
So let me show you what I'm working with here.	O
This is the character I was working out before.	O
He certainly not done, but you know, we're going to have the luxury of being like perfectly done with these.	O
I'll certainly spend some more time on him, clean up a few things that are.	O
Unreasonably loose, like the hands.	O
The hands are just blobs right now.	O
I refuse to have a piece, you know, call it finished with.	O
With loose looking hands.	O
So will certainly work on that.	O
So this guy, I think I'm going to put on hold 'cause we have one that's even.	O
Less finished, which is supposed to be.	O
Part of the two that I'm working on, so these two guys.	O
This guy.	O
And this guy working on both of 'em Today.	O
You know I was saying 3 days 6 characters, so these are the two.	O
I kinda like this background.	O
Oh, just grab it.	O
For the sake of time inefficiency.	O
Hey, big guy, I don't want you.	O
I want to see you messing with that screen.	O
Can I trust you?	O
So I can talk to my cat.	O
Hum.	O
Maybe something like that?	O
No wait then.	O
Hum.	O
Alright, just merging those together to kind of make this make this better fit.	O
This specific character.	O
Specially like these feedback here.	O
The name of the game is loose and painterly for sure.	O
Kind of like it.	O
I like the vibe of it, will see.	O
I definitely wanna try some other things out.	O
So let's see what we got.	O
Lock that.	O
Gotta work on the crossbow there.	O
I got my flat layers worked in.	O
Actually.	O
Yeah.	O
Make sure I pop open my.	O
Tool time line here to get started.	O
Cool.	O
Hum.	O
Want to make sure all the layers are locked?	O
That needs to be.	O
So we're good.	O
And basically on the last dream, I cleaned up my flat layer because somehow I deleted it.	O
I don't know what happened.	O
I must merge the layers down.	O
I didn't preserve my flat color layer, which helps me grab big sections of color.	O
Basically I just select magic one tool with WI, select the color I want.	O
And since contiguous still, I've never heard that word except for this.	O
Um?	O
It selects all the colors so you can see my flats aren't perfect, there's a bunch of little bits that'd selecting here that doesn't matter.	O
None of a matter.	O
But if I really want, I could always grab the lasso tool and unselect any pixels I don't want it to affect, but what I like about the continuous thing is it selects all the material of that color.	O
So all my cloak it's the backing is all green, the cloak is all blue on the front, the leather sections you know you basically just select all of the sections of a certain color, which is what I want.	O

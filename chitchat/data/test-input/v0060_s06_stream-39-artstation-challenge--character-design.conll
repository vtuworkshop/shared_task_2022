This is the multiply and color Dodge layer.	O
So.	O
I'm kinda see the effect is getting.	O
That's without.	O
This is with.	O
Without, without without with, so just kind of focusing that lighting a little bit more.	O
How you doing?	O
I'm doing pretty well how you doing Connor?	O
Oh, do I still have a?	O
Yeah, I still have the.	O
The Kitty Cam here.	O
Hello Connor, there you go.	O
So you guys are just staring at me.	O
My cat in my lap.	O
Founded time today.	O
Nice, that's good.	O
Squeezing in that our time where you can.	O
So OK, I'm trying to figure out what to do.	O
I think I'm going to keep those two adjustment layers separate.	O
And then.	O
I'm gonna keep my flats separate.	O
Oh this is all merged separately.	O
Anyway, I think.	O
Yeah, so there's the adjustments.	O
Merge that.	O
I think I'm going to go ahead and modify it.	O
These flat layers is a smoke bomb look like.	O
Medieval smoke bomb.	O
This is pretty sweet.	O
Push up Mary now.	O
Um?	O
Alright, let's draw it.	O
I think drawing would be.	O
Would be helpful.	O
Take some time extras extra lines.	O
Take some time for sure.	O
But I think it would be helpful.	O
A lot of times it's just easier to draw things than it is to try to figure out the shapes.	O
So what are you drawn by the way Connor?	O
Just kind of doodle in?	O
Or is there anything specific here working on?	O
Should I change my name to a panda gaming to like on Twitch or is it to be more professional in your actual name is better?	O
I mean that's totally without panda gaming.	O
Had it knows you by the way.	O
And let's You told me and I forgot my apologies.	O
I think it depends 'cause like if your if your art name is an alias, like a gamertag type thing.	O
That's kind of like a decision you make overall you know.	O
If you want to use.	O
Be Hans is like a more professional platform.	O
Yeah, you could use your real name but.	O
You know, that's like that's the same reason I use my real name on Twitch because I'm doing like my professional art stuff, so I want to keep my name consistent, but.	O
It's kind of like a personal decision all around.	O
Which I would recommend, but.	O
Yeah.	O
I have a very specific direction.	O

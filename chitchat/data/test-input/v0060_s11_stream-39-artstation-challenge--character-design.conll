Yeah, these guys are all part of like a secret society basically.	O
And this the Secret Society.	O
I forgot about the belt.	O
They called the protectors of the second realm.	O
This is the kind of story behind this group for the yard station challenge.	O
Groups And there is essentially entrusted with safeguarding the existence and access to.	O
This other realm that's called the second round.	O
It's kind of parallel to their own.	O
There's these Giants that live in the second round that sometimes step over into the common realm.	O
But a lot of people have never seen a giant or they don't even believe they exist, though there's been a lot of stories and people who claim that they've seen them.	O
And the Giants come from the second realm.	O
That's like the same world.	O
It's just like a parallel.	O
Realm.	O
And there is a way to the giant step over from time to time.	O
When certain circumstances are met.	O
In certain things happen, that's when they do it.	O
But People don't really know anything about it except for this group.	O
You know, they know it exists.	O
They kind of know how you get there.	O
But their job is to stop anyone else from getting there, because if you get into the second realm you can influence the common Rome.	O
So you could do it from like the shadows and you could.	O
You know?	O
Do some pretty bad things without being seen.	O
So there.	O
They are entrusted with safeguarding at second realm and this guy is the spy of the group.	O
He's basically an information gatherer, a spy, and if people are trying to infiltrate the second realm.	O
He's the one who learns about it first, so there's this spected plots.	O
To access the second realm, he'll try to find out about it.	O
And then the other people in the group have have different jobs like on how to stop it essentially.	O
But he's the one who learns about it first, so he's kind of got this, uh?	O
He's got this reversible coat, so his cloak on the outside kinda has the colors.	O
The blue and gold, the colors of the group that he's a part of an, but people don't know that you know, it's just kind of this nice pattern.	O
And then if he wants to.	O
Be more sneaky, he can reverse it to the green side, which blends in with, you know, the forest and stuff and.	O
Looks a little less fancy, but if he's trying to fit in in town and look like.	O
An important person or just trying to fit in a social setting?	O
I may use the blue side.	O
Alright, so that was just me updating the flat layers.	O
I'm going to lock that layer 'cause I do not want to lose it.	O
Oh, I should definitely let's try this again.	O
I'm going to duplicate that extras layer.	O
Black colors.	O
Duplicate.	O
Duplicated multiple times.	O
All right?	O
So that now I have that flat color layer on top too, so I'm going to merge that with the painting.	O
Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and murder.	O

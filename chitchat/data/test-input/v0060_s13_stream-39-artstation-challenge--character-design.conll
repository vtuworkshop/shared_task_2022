Keep spying on my pen.	O
Like a little goofball.	O
All right now I gotta think about.	O
Where am I going with this?	O
When do you need this done by this do on Monday?	O
So it's basically like I can work on 2 characters a day.	O
So we got this character that I've worked up a little bit.	O
I mean, there's supposed to be finished.	O
By today, these two at least, but I'm certainly going to.	O
Certainly going to try to work on Sunday on them.	O
And you know anytime I can get before Monday basically.	O
But these guys are supposed to be brought up to a higher level finish, which they are.	O
Far from.	O
Sup Emily, how you doing?	O
How many layers of you got?	O
It's a good question.	O
I could merge them down and I should.	O
I usually just require a few layers.	O
I'll show you guys what I'm talking bout by getting rid of my banner here so you can see my layers.	O
So quite a few, but do I need this?	O
Many probably not.	O
So what I usually have is my background layered.	O
I'll usually have my lines.	O
Which are turned off at the moment.	O
So I have my lines layered and you can see there's multiple line layer.	O
This was with the additions we just made.	O
So I put those on a separate layer just in case these were additions previously that it could merge down so I can merge these down.	O
Have goggles which were like a separate thought.	O
I still may do that but I have him on a separate layer 'cause I don't know if I'll use 'em.	O
So yeah, I just group those lines.	O
Technically, I only really need one.	O
And then I have a layer in my line layer.	O
Group is just A to darken and down so I can see my lines easier 'cause it's hard to see my lines with all the painting behind it.	O
So usually it's like my background, my lines layer and then I'll make a mask with my flat colors on one layer and I'll keep that, and then I'll paint.	O
So I was this.	O
This was an alternate version I think.	O
I just I guess I saved my original 'cause sometimes I like saving stages of completion.	O
I don't know why I have so many flats.	O
Because that was my original.	O
Usually it's background.	O
Am ask flat colors, paint layer and lines, so it's, but sometimes will make duplicates of certain ones and different versions case.	O
I want to go back to him or have the option.	O
But really, I just need these flat layers my painted layer.	O
My lines in my background that's theoretically would all I need.	O
You can see I've locked.	O
Like all the layers, I'm not using just, so I can't accidentally paint on them.	O
Yeah thanks Wolf will see what I can do to work up his face now though.	O
Oh yeah, and usually I have this layer of my painting and then I'll make a layer on top of it.	O
Just for whatever I'm painting now.	O
So in case I mess it up, you know I'd like to have a.	O
I don't always paint on this one layer.	O
Sometimes I'll paint on.	O
One layer on top of my main painting.	O
That way I can adjust it.	O
Be pretty flexible.	O
Face, I definitely need to work on the face.	O

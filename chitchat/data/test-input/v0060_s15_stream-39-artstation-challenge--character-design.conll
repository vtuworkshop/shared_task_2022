Mother Russia Not good at accents, I'm sorry.	O
Good girl.	O
We do it for mother Russia.	O
Putin.	O
How is that pretty impressive, right?	O
I know what you're thinking, Sam.	O
What are you doing?	O
Drawing you could be a world famous voice actor, but you know?	O
Just wasn't my calling.	O
Is that really the best ECU time soon?	O
This piece of the Cape I gotta stay zoomed out.	O
Or what's what's the classic Russian accent that I remember?	O
He has remember this old this old gym.	O
A little my friends.	O
FPS Russia here I was.	O
I was awful apologize for that one.	O
FPS Russia hasn't been a thing for like a decade, right?	O
I'm not really up on the memes.	O
He could still be around.	O
Think he got in some legal trouble sometime back.	O
I really don't know.	O
Wait are we?	O
Is it still safe?	O
Oh no.	O
It's been playing.	O
I don't know this one album I was playing.	O
I think it's safe 'cause I know Wade was playing it.	O
But then it Spotify does a thing where I finish is an album and it just starts playing on his own.	O
I don't know how long it's been doing that so.	O
Let's keep it a.	O
Stream safe music.	O
Um, falling you thought of doing a faceless various.	O
Think of all the time you'd save on the character, but I did well, faceless kinda.	O
Wait Sam, are you a native Russian speaker?	O
I will point would you add extra details like a bookmark or waxy low man?	O
I don't think we'll get that detailed, but if I did it would be like.	O
Like 1 brush stroke.	O
You know what I mean?	O
Like if I was doing a wax seal, probably pick like a red.	O
I don't know where.	O
If you're saying like on the book or something.	O
I probably do like a red and then like a highlight.	O
And then maybe like a shadow town.	O
Like 3 three brush strokes.	O
Measure your wax seal, you know.	O
Like I don't have a, I don't have enough time for details like that, so there's my wax seal.	O
I don't think you would put a wax seal in the front of the book to that looks kind of cool.	O
Looks an interesting.	O
Like what is that?	O
What's going on there?	O
What's the story behind that red mark?	O
Who knows?	O
It just looks cool.	O
Yeah, it's kind of doing shapes there.	O
Shapes to imply something.	O
But probably I don't know, I mean.	O
The best thing to do would be to do it at the end, 'cause I'm trying to focus on the big shapes.	O
That's not to say that I'm always disciplined about that.	O
You know, I get caught up in.	O
Things that probably don't matter as much like what I should be doing right now is this face.	O
And the chest area, like that's kind of what's the focal point of this piece?	O
So that's that's what's important, but.	O
I'll probably do that momentarily.	O
Sometimes things catch my eye.	O

Kind of game.	O
Intriguing does seem dig.	O
It triggered sometimes when I'm doing selections.	O
Either that or that's just when it happens.	O
Change layer make a selection to make a selection.	O
Change layers again trying to paint.	O
It happens, well.	O
Did it ever go away?	O
I guess that's the question.	O
Alright, so that I didn't want to make a note of this.	O
One hour, 30 minutes, maybe 30 seconds.	O
One hour, 30 minutes 30 seconds.	O
So it's like.	O
Switch layers, select the background with the magic wand.	O
Switch layers again control H.	O
OK.	O
Control shift die.	O
I don't know.	O
I can't seem to reproduce that thing.	O
I don't even know how glitches work like.	O
Reproducing, I wonder if sometimes like a long series of actions that caused it.	O
But they have the face needs.	O
Some love with zoom.	O
I don't know why I sounded like Christopher Walken when I said that.	O
It does Henry.	O
You are 100% correct.	O

It was just like it ended like 30 minutes before I was going live here.	O
So it's not too far off time Wise.	O
Oh cool, yeah.	O
If you didn't see it that it was a design off challenge.	O
This dreams are only an hour long.	O

Didn't get very far, but in an hour I was able to.	O
Get this drawing down of Batman mixed with bane in the mass mix with the monocle and cigarette Holder thing of the Penguin is going to try to put a little bit of a hood of the scarecrows hood into his Cole very subtly.	O

One more if you guys haven't seen him is the wild character he worked on this recently too.	O
It's crazy goat man.	O
But if you guys want to check it out.	O
You can check out my artstation.	O
It's pretty much the same work you'll see on my.	O
Might be hands, but if you go to challenges here under my profile you can find the submission that I'm doing.	O
So if you want to see like everything we've done up until this point, I'm posting it.	O
You can see the kind of step by step process.	O
For all the characters, I think I have one more post tomorrow, like the process of it, so I'll post that.	O
You guys can check that out tomorrow.	O
I have the costumes for every character.	O
All the brainstorming for costume design that we've done and then at the very bottom you can see the poses that we initially did and.	O
The story basically behind who these characters are.	O

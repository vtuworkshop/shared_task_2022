Hello and welcome to another stream here and be hands.	O
I am Anna Davis court at Children's book illustrator, drawing cute things for you including this little pull cord.	O
And here is my best friend Anthony.	O
Hello Anthony Hello.	O
We're having a lovely Wednesday so far, so thank you so much for joining us.	O
It's lovely to see you all trickling, and it's awesome.	O
Um, I am so excited because today we got to get back to our boy potato.	O
If you didn't catch the last stream.	O
We were talking before the stream, how loud my screams were.	O
Malby has told me in the past that.	O
Screens hurt, they cause him pain.	O
So I was testing how they sounded anthelmia he just melodious tunes.	O
What you talk, what do you say what?	O
Also we came up with a new.	O
Phrase what would you say?	O
You gotta do it.	O
Maybe it's just a pun or word play, sure, but you have to go.	O
But Anthony laugh sometimes.	O
Like little like silent laughs, but then little intakes of error that make a squeak.	O
Like We decided to call this the losa laughter.	O
Hold that out like no problem.	O
So the fun game is Heart Heart.	O
Please.	O
Game is flowing today, I should say.	O
Uh-huh flowing like lava, Laster.	O
Now it doesn't work, you know Penn State work and we're learning publicly here, so it's always a good time to work on our word play.	O
So if you guys have any favorite puns, please put them in the chat.	O
I would love to see them.	O
Got Yousra in the chat saying Hi Ann Kim also saying Hi Doc Oh Oh yeah.	O
Device saying made it hey ya what up?	O
Oh my gosh discord crew flowing in did you guys see that the discord is popping off right now?	O
So if you guys want to have some chats with people that you love and just fun all around like bird gifts and book talk and sharing pet pictures and snacks, go to the discord.	O
There's a link in the description too, so just click it.	O
and I thank you.	O
Everybody has joined.	O
It's been so much fun.	O
Like, seriously, I wake up everyday and that's my new Twitter where I'm just like what are they saying on discord.	O
Pet hash is probably a lot more, I don't know.	O
Personalized or better?	O
Peter is definitely become my bad news zone, but it's bad news that I need sometimes and other times it's just depressing.	O
So everybody has their own.	O
I measure of whether it's too much or too little information coming in about the world so it's nice to have something that's just purely your friends talking.	O
And that's what I really feel like the discord is, and we can really make whatever conversations happen that we want.	O
So if you've ever felt like I really want to talk to people about my Ghibli movie obsession.	O
Or my music tastes?	O
Or my book that I just read and really want to talk to people about it?	O
Boom, discord it up.	O
Let's chat.	O
And I'm just going to cough and I don't always like reply to everything, especially on time I am notorious for being a bad like.	O
What do you call it?	O
Like text reply are communicator but I am always watching so.	O
Yeah, that's right, I'm there.	O
I'll read your stuff.	O
I won't always reply about it, but if you ever want me to like specifically, say like my input on whatever, like we have a current work tab.	O

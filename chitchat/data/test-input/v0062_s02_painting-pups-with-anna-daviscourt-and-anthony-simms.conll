It's true he's in bed, in several different rooms, so.	O
Normal i'ma nomads just like ang Jackson drew a picture of him, posted it in the current window.	O
My gosh Segway.	O
Yes, let's show that.	O
OK, so we've got a current work tab on the discord so you guys can show off your awesome artwork and I also post here and we've got a beautiful ang boy.	O
Oh my gosh, my boy look at him oh, he's so good and I love his outfit off the shoulder.	O
He's amazing, oh, I actually was thinking about doing more of this in my characters where it feels like the risk goes a little bit chunkier.	O
I actually love that kind of styling of things, so I want to try that with my next my next round, but I love this outfit design that you've done.	O
He looks very determined as ang do as I do.	O
Is he your favorite character?	O
Anthony Jackson from Avatar the Last Airbender.	O
We've also got Sammy who learned her work schedule and just said like no to it.	O
Special already tired.	O
Sad, I'm sorry, but this is a beautiful drawing and I really hope that you actually have a sweater that matches your hair perfectly.	O
So she Anthony.	O
Yeah, and then Johanna actually made Halloween Crunch.	O
Oh my gosh, so we've got more Halloween themed cereals and just I think we thought of Count Chocula was there like one other one but we need more in the world is like spooky Chris.	O
Which is that a real thing?	O
Or is it a thing you just made up as like a funky crisp is the real serial but spooky Chris is a fake serial.	O
I thought we were coming up with fake serial no.	O
I'm saying like real ones 'cause Calculus, a real Halloween themed cereal.	O
Halloween Crunch is a real serial.	O
No that ones made up but I just wanted to know like what really I think.	O
Count Chocula I mean so that only comes out in October, no, but there seemed like Count Chocula.	O
Their count is at Dracula like character, so like that is Halloween themed, even if it's all year round.	O
Let us out.	O
But there could be a lot more like marshmallows that are shaped like bones.	O
Come on, why we not done that yet?	O
And it had a nice, satisfying crunched.	O
Exactly, that's why Halloween Crunches.	O
Oh my gosh.	O
Perfect use around the chat saying lol.	O
I'm rearranging now after I thought no no.	O
Yeah she was posting the discord earlier.	O
I think that she was assembling IKEA piece for some reason.	O
That's really like therapeutic to me.	O
What do you guys feel about IKEA?	O
'cause like I love it.	O
I love putting together that stuff and being like yes, this is what I'm doing right now, nothing else.	O
Yeah, if it's going smoothly, but if you get to a point it's just not fitting or it's just like really frustrating puzzles where it's like there's a satisfying amount of challenge, but if it goes beyond that, it's just frustration.	O
Yeah, totally, but I think the only time that I felt that was when we were putting together my Dresser which had drawers, which is like moving parts that have to fit perfectly to make it smooth.	O
And eventually it worked out.	O
But I had a few pinched fingers that was.	O
That was pretty rough.	O
Now being the chancing oh too cute, this is sunglasses Anna Q and then that goes on to say to get a new backgrounds.	O
Yeah Heather in the truck saying hey I'm not stopping to say Hello Hello Heather great which other is this I will see.	O
To do other Hawkins said hello.	O
Welcome to the chat.	O
So good to see you and I mean everybody.	O
Thank you all for coming, but I'm also really excited that you came today because we're finishing potato.	O
We're just working on this one post for now and then I think, how about we move on to these guys?	O
'cause as I said before, sometimes it's better for me to start with the rough work and then work two refined, but my mind always is like this is where we left off last time.	O
It's like a video game you just like take the.	O
Pick up where you left off, but hey, ain't nobody give me rules I can do whatever I want so let's do rough work yeah, rough dog, come on.	O
And it was saying amazing I should screenshot my current homework.	O
Absolutely I would love to see that and your own homework, but you've assigned to yourself.	O
But excellent.	O
Oh wait, you're doing school motion, aren't you?	O
Yes, I would love to see that continue.	O
Sorry Anthony Jackson responding to your question about hang being his favorite character says yes.	O

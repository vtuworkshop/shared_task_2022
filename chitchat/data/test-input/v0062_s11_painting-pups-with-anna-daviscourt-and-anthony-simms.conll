Divorce is better for me, that's good.	O
I think that everybody has their own journey and whatever is best for you for the future is most important.	O
It's kind of like thinking about are like we were saying for like where you want yourself to end up you kind of have to think about OK, what is best for the long-term journey here?	O
And you know if if things are five years down the road, do I want them to be the same as they are now, or do I want to actively progress myself in a different direction and that kind of thing?	O
Now be in the chat saying no, no, no.	O

His family member, I think it might have been his mom, needed a little sweater.	O

But look at that sweater.	O
All that looks like is it knitted or crocheted possibly?	O
Oh my gosh, she's so precious.	O
Look at her little rabbit feed all stretched out all I love her.	O

Come on.	O
I love your pets.	O

I want more of them.	O
If you ever questioning like oh, should I post this picture to the discord, the answer is yes.	O
Just do it.	O
It's really a public service that you're doing so.	O
And only chat saying I barely make a one year plan.	O
I mostly just have a bucket list of cool projects and brands I want to work with.	O
Absolutely Kendall.	O
I agree.	O
Barely make a one year plan.	O
Yeah, six months only the healthiest critical about living.	O
If you want like less stressful anxiety ridden Life.	O
'cause If you make a plan and then you're not on track to follow it, you're just going to feel like a failure, especially if it's like 5 years you like I made this plan five years ago and I'm still not enteractive doing it.	O
That just doesn't seem like it would be a good feeling to that's what I think you should always like reassess as you go.	O
Like if you're feeling like it's five years and you haven't made motion, then within those five years you should have changed the plans like.	O
One of the things that I've heard of in like time management or whatever blogs or things anyway, people who know what they're talking about, how told me.	O
They, uh, plan in increments, as in like if you have a five year plan, let's way too big of a like oh I want to be, you know, making comics at DC or Marvel or something like that.	O
But if you break it down to smaller and smaller more manageable chunks and get to today tomorrow, like, what do I do tomorrow to get to that goal five years from now?	O
And you know, it starts with I'm gonna write down my favorite ideas for an original comic like that is much more doable.	O
So keeping yourself on track that way will make it so you never wind up five years being disappointed with where we've gotten because you're always reassessing and you're always breaking it down to manageable bits.	O

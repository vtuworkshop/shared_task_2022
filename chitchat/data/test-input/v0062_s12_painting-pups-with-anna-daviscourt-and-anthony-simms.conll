And especially if I made a five year plan, I bet you in two years I'm going to have a totally different idea of what I want for my career and myself.	O
So yeah, constantly reassessing is kind of the better way to go, I think.	O
You've got your Hannah in the chat thing potato potato.	O
Well, imagine think about this.	O
Do you don't do any of those things now?	O
He's this to the East.	O
The potato.	O
You are what you eat and he ate potato.	O
Yeah, he's just a Roly Poly little bundle covered in dirt Kindle.	O
Saying Haha, I'm so calling my desk.	O
The board desk mat.	O
It's where you belong.	O
Businesswoman, current says.	O
Lol I love it.	O
Businesswoman Kendall.	O
Yeah, that's right.	O
Kendall says Lol.	O
Anthony with the robot voice letter speed where I ask him to do accents for you guys.	O
And this is what he is.	O
Access of a robot Heather say actually my art had a lot to do with the divorce because he didn't think it was important yet.	O
It's my life.	O
Kind of a big deal but.	O
Yeah, absolutely.	O
I have a known couples who have been held back by each other, not agreeing with the outcome of like career in life is not a way to go honestly.	O
Of course, I always encourage everybody to try to figure out their problems and all that, but if there is ever a feeling of like someone in your life is actually holding you back from what you want out of life, like Majorly consider that question and maybe bring up with that.	O
Communication is key.	O
Now these as kind of fixed in air BRBCMLVRB.	O
Actually we're I should've mentioned, oh, we're at time.	O
OK, so on Monday we went for an hour and a half and so we were saying today would be the hour one.	O
Uhm so unfortunately sorry now you won't be back.	O
We're going to cut out early here, sorry I didn't mention that in the like.	O
What do you call it?	O
The schedule that we have, but it was something that Anthony and I decided like right before the stream.	O
So on Friday we will be back for an hour and a half on that day, right?	O
Anthony?	O
Yes, so that work with your schedule your schedule OK, uhm and then on Monday we will start it back up with the regular schedule.	O
Unless of course we decide to change it again 'cause we're just mad like that.	O
Mad last the best plan is no flag.	O
Yeah, apparently.	O
Kendall said that in the chat.	O
No way, yeah.	O
She also said parasite, which I don't know what she's got the movie movie.	O
There's no context around it.	O
And let's say was something that we talked about.	O
But Uhm, I hope you guys enjoyed our little potato painting session.	O
We're not all the way done, but we're getting closer.	O
This guy is definitely done.	O
I love his like loose quality.	O
The one thing that I did notice today that I haven't added before was just this little white before the Brown on his little tippy toe pause.	O
It.	O
Also back here I'll do that.	O
But before we sign of-, is there anything you would like to say to the people?	O
Anthony, yes, I would like to finish reading your comments and cares about 8:00 or so.	O
Oh my gosh, you guys, mouthpiece says, I love that.	O
Let's do it.	O
I want the full Commission.	O
I accept love, you change on a dime.	O
But yeah.	O
User says I make one year plan but divide the year into four quarters and I evaluate every quarter at the Infinite.	O
Anthony Jackson says there's no perfect path in the five year plan.	O
You have to make changes along the road, but make sure you're still on track as men.	O
Kindle says, I like the three goals option for planning three goals today.	O
Three a week, three a month, 3 every 46 months, etc.	O
It's easier.	O
Now that's a good idea.	O
What do you think, Anthony?	O
I have to make a plan.	O
Multiple.	O
Yeah, I think breaking it up into segments is a lot more digestible and.	O
For sure, I think that making it into segments is good.	O
I just wonder how far out you go where it's like.	O
I don't know I guess.	O
Start closer then get further, but then if you have a really big goal in mind, you have to break it down to like the closer bits from the further bit.	O
So I don't know.	O
I think maybe it's just individual for everyone and you have to find your way of doing things and if it's not working out for you then try to change it up.	O
Look for different ways from other people.	O
Everybody has their own kind of Outlook on it for me.	O

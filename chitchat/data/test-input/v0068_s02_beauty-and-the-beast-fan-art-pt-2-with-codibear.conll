Uhm, but I think we kind of have to wing it a little bit in terms of the swords.	O
I'm going to redraw them completely because now that I can see them, there are a lot thinner than I have them here and.	O
I don't know like there, it's the texture that they used.	O
Painting this background is almost like hockey.	O
It almost looks like chalk pastels so there really isn't all that much detail.	O
You know something funny that I noticed while watching it.	O
If you look at the chair here from far away, it's just like this.	O
Funny these funny things that animators can get away with an in the moment you don't even notice it, but when you're really paying attention to it, it's there.	O
Far away this chair is.	O
Has no detail on it at all.	O
On the fabric it's purple, actually, and it's from up close.	O
It's got all kinds of floral detail and it's white.	O
How strange is that?	O
Like when you're watching the movie, you don't even notice stuff like that.	O
Pretty funny.	O
Anyway.	O
I'm going to start with payee do welcome to the stream.	O
How are you doing nice to see you?	O
I'm just going to go ahead and just like completely delete this shield and sword and just start over.	O
He says I've been looking forward to this this afternoon.	O
I have not managed to do any drawing since Monday.	O
Oh well, technically I haven't.	O
I haven't drawn anything since my last stream either.	O
I was actually yeah I.	O
I've been looking forward to working on this more.	O
Uhm, I can't wait to.	O
To start adding color, the coloring process is actually always my favorite part.	O
I'm not a huge fan of sketching to be honest.	O
Um, because it takes a lot less brain power to color.	O
Um and like?	O
I don't mind the problem solving with sketching and everything but.	O
You know what I could do?	O
You just copy and paste one of these guys.	O
I don't, yeah.	O
I don't mind me, uhm.	O
The problem solving that goes into it, but.	O
It is more just like it's like coloring a coloring book.	O
When I'm just doing the coloring process, which is kind of fun.	O
Looks a little better.	O
Let's pull this up.	O
I think this is going to be the outside.	O
This is going to be the.	O
The wouldn't.	O
Frame that it's on and then the Shields inside the shield is a little rounder on the top.	O
Yeah, it's kind of got rounded corners on the top, so I'm going to edit that.	O
This round these groups wrong color.	O
How did I get white on my brush?	O
That's weird.	O
OK, around these corners this like this enough.	O
I'll just go back and erase it.	O
And I can just copy and paste this shape.	O
Bro are inside.	O
That looks much, much, much better than what we had yesterday.	O
OK, in the design on the inside of the shield is also.	O
Fairly vague, uhm, it just.	O
There really isn't much of a design, it's just kind of got some squidbillies on it, so I think I'm just going to keep it kind of vague and do the same thing, just kind of do.	O
Some little.	O
Indication of a design but.	O
Nothing crazy.	O
Imply that there is detail there, but we don't need to see all of it.	O
OK, so new layer.	O
Let's hold shift make a straight line.	O
And we're going to go like this.	O
Very, very thin swords here.	O
And it took out more on the bottom than they do on this pop.	O

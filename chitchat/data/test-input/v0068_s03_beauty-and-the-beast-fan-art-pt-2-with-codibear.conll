You guys you know, I'm not a big fan of summer.	O
I know this is like a total Tangent.	O
I'm not a huge fan of summer.	O
Personally, my favorite season is autumn and I just happened to see some people starting to do some autumn art work today on Instagram and I was like I can't wait until fall this year.	O
I'm so excited to start doing fall artwork again.	O
Um?	O
I, I mean, as you guys know, I really love Earth tones and.	O
All of my art work pretty much always kind of.	O
Looks like it's made in fall so fall time is always my favorite time of the year, especially within the art community.	O
OK, so.	O
You see me leaning over this way.	O
It's because I'm like blind and I'm trying to look at all the detail.	O
Um?	O
OK.	O
You know what I could do is I could look up.	O
A sword.	O
So I can at least get an idea this sword images so I can at least get an idea of what a handle would look like.	O
Sword with handguard?	O
OK.	O
So.	O
It would probably look something like.	O
This.	O
It sticks out that up here.	O
Excel on the top just below.	O
The curve.	O
I think we're going to make this or just a little bit, or I'm sorry the shield just a little blips.	O
Feel just a little bit taller.	O
OK, and then we can just copy and paste this guy and then flip him.	O
Go to the left.	O
If you want to move an object, uhm.	O
Along the same plane you can just hold shift.	O
It will go right on over.	O
Oh shoot, did I just lock my keyboard again?	O
I did 1 second.	O
We figured out how to fix this.	O
Sorry for the Beeping.	O
OK.	O
It's it's.	O
You guys weren't here for it.	O
Um, there was a stream like I don't know.	O
I think it was last week where I had accidentally locked my keyboard by holding shift down too long and it took us so long to figure out how to fix it when in reality.	O
When in reality all I had to do was hold down shift for like 8 or 10 seconds again.	O
Um?	O
Turn it back off.	O
But I have learned since then.	O
OK, now I can go to this layer and just erase Flack.	O
Find this the swords.	O
So.	O

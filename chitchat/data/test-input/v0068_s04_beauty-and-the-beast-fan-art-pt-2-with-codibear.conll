OK, that looks so much better than what we did last time.	O
Autumn is the best, is clever.	O
Hey, welcome all I know, isn't it?	O
I love Pumpkins and all the.	O
Spices and the leaves.	O
And oh, it's so cozy and blanket.	O
So great.	O
OK.	O
Um?	O
Now OK, so I realized yesterday after the end of the stream, um, so this right here this piece would not be lined up with the flooring like this because this has dimension, right?	O
This is lifted up off the ground like a couple of inches, so really it would probably go a couple inches pass.	O
The edge of the wall.	O
Make a line all the way across like this.	O
So it's even on both sides.	O
And then we can just erase.	O
What layer is that?	O
Then we can just go back and erase this bit.	O
All the petty things awakened very true.	O
The only reason I love Spring is because of the Flowers like like all like all the beautiful Flowers everywhere.	O
But really I am definitely.	O
More of an autumn winter person than anything else.	O
Uhm, OK.	O
That looks better now.	O
Now it's got dimension of against the wall.	O
Um?	O
OK, let's go ahead and extend.	O
The.	O
Curtain here so we can get it all the way up against the edge of the.	O
Image.	O
And look at the curves.	O
This curtain.	O
So when we're making the folds of the curtain, we have to make sure that these lines line up with these lines, and I'll explain what I'm talking about.	O
When you're drawing.	O
Wrinkles in fabric.	O
Word that OK, where's the where's the layer?	O
There it is.	O
Or three draw these 'cause I actually don't look all that great.	O
Actually, in all reality, this line doesn't look that great either.	O
Um, let's redraw this one.	O
This one needs to extend out a little bit more, I think.	O
Horizontally.	O
Take up a little bit more space there.	O
Um?	O
So it needs to.	O
I think the reason that it doesn't look natural is that it needs to be a little bit more drapey here.	O
It looks a little better, and then there's probably a robe.	O
Let's just assume that there's that would be would be a rope here as well, because we can't really see it in the scene.	O
But of course you would need another rope to hold this bit of the burden of proof.	O
Uhm, OK so.	O
When we go to draw.	O
This line needs to be a little bit more curvy.	O
Drapey Getting that getting that natural drape in is difficult sometimes.	O
Specially since I've never drawn a curtain like this before.	O
OK, so when we draw in our.	O
Wrinkles.	O
Gonna go up like loops.	O
Up like whoops.	O
It actually comes further out up here on the top and then comes in.	O
About here.	O
And then so you need to connect this line to another line down here.	O
Instead of just like, kind of like Willy Nilly like making lines wherever.	O
Like this it will look more natural.	O
If you connect them.	O
Then making them.	O

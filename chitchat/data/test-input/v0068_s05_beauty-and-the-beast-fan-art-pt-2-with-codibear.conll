Not all evenly spaced too, because fabric will fold naturally.	O
Unevenly.	O
And I'll probably go back and work on these more when we do the coloring too.	O
Very bump something on my desk.	O
I think what I'm going to do for the curtain on the bottom they just give it a little bit more detail.	O
I'm going to go like this.	O
I'm gonna extend out the bottom.	O
Maybe I won't kind of makes it look like pants.	O
Let's just leave it simple.	O
OK.	O
Next we have the waynes coating.	O
Which is pretty interesting.	O
I've never really seen waynes coding like this before.	O
It's got a top out like a Topper.	O
Let's make a new layer.	O
At the top portion.	O
The source.	O
Big problem.	O
And it's got a base for it as well.	O
And then it's, uh.	O
Some rectangle pieces, vertical rectangle pieces.	O
Not too worried about whether they're perfectly evenly spaced, it's totally fine.	O
Not looking for perfection here.	O
The normally say.	O
Uhm, and then they have like Oh actually these guys have.	O
Dimension.	O
So I'm going to give them some depth.	O
For some Wiz brother.	O
They're like pieces of wood.	O
And then there's also like 2.	O
Vertical divots on either one?	O
Starting to kind of look like a room.	O
Wow, amazing.	O
And then I'll probably draw in some.	O
Um?	O
Was it called wood grain on these?	O
When we do the coloring process?	O
But I don't need to draw in all that detail when we do this sketch.	O
Oh, and also this would actually be a perfect scene to do the overlay lighting layer that I usually do because it is a fireplace lit scene so.	O
Yeah, we'll have.	O
Some will have some good ambience on this one.	O
But really, it didn't really work with these Cinderella one because I was using some lighter colors.	O
But this is going to be a much darker seen.	O
So actually Speaking of which.	O
Once we finish this sketch.	O
I will probably darken up the background color and work from a darker background color.	O
Kind of almost like an underpainting.	O
Any of you guys are familiar with traditional painting?	O
Basic lines.	O
There we go, there is the waynes coating.	O
OK.	O
And.	O
Hey Sean, how are you doing welcome?	O

We are slowly but surely making progress on this.	O
Now, I might actually make the mantle taller.	O
Hum.	O
Because, well, for one in the scene, I actually can't see what in no point in the movie can you see what.	O
Is up here.	O
Up above the fireplace so I don't want to just yes.	O
Um, so I think I might just make the fireplace taller.	O
Plus, these columns are pretty like extravagant with these ladies holding the mantle up and stuff.	O
They will probably make the mantle light come up here and then.	O
All I can see up here is like there's like an urn sitting on the mantle.	O
Like this?	O
Like an urn sitting up here.	O
It's the weather.	O
There is like painting up here or anything.	O
I think that's the only image you see of the fireplace.	O
It could be wrong.	O
So.	O
OK.	O
Moving right along, I think I am going to do.	O
The wallpaper really quick just because it's pretty simple.	O
I'm just going to do.	O
Play, let's do this at.	O
Um?	O
Yeah, it's pretty much just a grid at a 45 degree angle.	O
So what I'm going to do?	O
Yeah, they're just little squares, both diamonds, but their squares just turned on inside.	O
So how I'm going to draw it just like this?	O
And not all going to be perfectly even, but that's OK.	O
'cause I'm going to draw over this and Rostyle anyway, so it's totally fine.	O
And if you're wondering.	O
Uh, how to how I'm making these perfectly straight lines?	O
It's not that I have a very steady hand.	O
I'm holding down shift.	O
And if you hold down shift, you can also move things at increments.	O
So actually, you know what?	O
This.	O
Just realized I should have since I put it in a 45 degree angle.	O
I actually should have done it more all than wide.	O
I want to make it too OK, I'll just.	O
Update.	O
So go like that and we'll just copy and paste the layer.	O
Liberal.	O
OK, we go massive erase.	O
I'll leave a little excess going around the mantle just because I don't have those perfect lines right now.	O

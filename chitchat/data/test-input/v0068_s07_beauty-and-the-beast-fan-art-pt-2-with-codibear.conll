Haven't slept because I haven't flushed it out yet.	O
So just in case I need a little.	O
Little.	O
Little leeway.	O
I want to erase it completely.	O
And what is that line right there?	O
Like an extra line for some reason.	O
OK.	O
Looks pretty good.	O
And I'm just going to condense the sound into one layer, and I'm actually going to lower the Opacity just so it's not so.	O
So in our face.	O
Oh, by the way guys, I'm I'm only streaming for an hour and a half today instead of 2 hours and also I don't know if I'll be able to do another stream this week.	O
Sadly I have a couple of doctor appointments and stuff like that because of.	O
Everything that's been going on on, uh.	O
Just this week's been rough.	O
Uhm, so I will probably not be able to stream this again this week, but I will be back next week.	O
To work on this a little bit more.	O
OK.	O
So let's go ahead and draw in.	O
The rug so the rug.	O
Is it's a big red rug and we're just going to go straight across the entire image here and give a little space in front of the mantle.	O
And then we're going to hold down shift and go straight across and this rug has.	O
A border.	O
Let's see so the border on the left side I think would be.	O
Ask the.	O
Fireplace since I'm putting the.	O
The chair, the right.	O
Actually, in all reality.	O
The like in the scene here I'll just show you in the scene.	O
The rug is actually.	O
The short end of the rug is next to the fireplace, but I think since I'm going to.	O
Move the chair.	O
I'm just going to make the rug extend all the way across the image.	O
Putting in some artistic.	O
Artistic leeway here, so let's make that actually going to make it a little thicker.	O
Let's make that the edge of the rug.	O
And so the edge of the rug actually has.	O
Them gold detailing on both sides.	O
So like this.	O
And then it's got some swirly designs.	O
Going around it.	O
Huh?	O
And the majority of the rug itself is actually just plain red in the middle.	O
There's a design, but from this angle we probably wouldn't see that.	O
So I'm just going to go ahead and leave it blank.	O
And then there's also some marble tiles, some pretty large marble tiles, so I'm going to.	O

From like this.	O
Cool OK, looks pretty good.	O
It actually looks like a room now.	O
That's great.	O
And I guess I'll just add some little details.	O
On to the rug.	O
Alot of the time I will just add.	O
Some little lines like this to indicate that there are rug fibers, and I'll do that in the sketch just to remind myself to add that detail at the end, because sometimes I don't remember.	O
And then of course after I posted, I'm like, oh, I forgot to add that, so I'm going to Adam and right now.	O
And little fibers.	O
Complained that Adam on the edge 2.	O
I like to do this with sweaters as well.	O
I feel like it adds just like a little bit of a neat little detail because it kind of looks.	O
It kind of makes it look a little bit more fluffy.	O
And it kind of looks like some.	O
Maybe some threads are poking through and stuff like that.	O
I think it adds like it's a tiny little detail for sweaters, but it adds a lot.	O
Hey Caroline, welcome to the stream.	O
How are you doing?	O
Speaking of memory save Oh my gosh, thank you clever.	O
I haven't saved this whole time.	O
Oh my goodness, thank you so much.	O
OK.	O
I'm going to save again just for good measure.	O
OK, so on the fireplace.	O
Um?	O
On the fireplace, there's a little um.	O
Would rock here.	O
I'm going to draw that in.	O
And let's see.	O
For the longest time, you guys I struggled so much with drawing fire.	O
Oh my goodness, I could not figure out how I wanted to draw fire and I have gone through so many iterations.	O
I feel like every single image that I've ever done has a different version of fire because I'm always trying to like, OK, is this how I want to draw fire?	O
Is this how I want to do it?	O
But I feel like I've kind of gone the more simplistic route like I have with the majority of my work.	O
I'll pull it up like the last couple of images.	O
I've actually just been kind of doing, like rounded triangles, almost.	O
Percent.	O
And let's pull up.	O
Yeah.	O
So this image I did on stream.	O
Uh, like a couple months ago, see as you can see is just like simple little rounded triangles, and although it's not very realistic fire of course.	O
It still gets the point across like it's really simple.	O
It's a really simple silhouette, but you can still tell as the viewer.	O
You can still tell that that's fire, especially since it's in enclosed in an oven or stove.	O
Rather, you can tell that it's fires, so um and then with candles I pretty much do a really simple flame, like a rounded, like almost like a your drop shape or a candle flame.	O
Um, there was the other one.	O
Is there another one that I did?	O
Oh it was uhm?	O
Fredericks house this one.	O
This one actually was a little bit different.	O
I kind of like this.	O
Uhm, this one was the first one that I did with me trying to figure out like.	O
OK maybe I should just go a little bit more rounded, but as you can see like there's still kind of like got that pointy tip.	O

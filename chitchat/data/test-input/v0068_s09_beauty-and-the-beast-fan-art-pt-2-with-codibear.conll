But I think I'm just going to continue to do more of a rounded shape.	O
I don't know.	O
We'll see how it goes on this one.	O
Um?	O
Uh, do some work into the stream.	O
Thank you, appreciate it.	O
I'm glad you have an interest in my work and a welcome to the stream.	O
OK so.	O
Actually, I just realized that I forgot.	O
Forgot to draw this line here.	O
Whoops, not holding shift.	O
To indicate the depth there.	O
OK.	O
So also.	O
There are some little squiggly lines.	O
Here, they're kind of just like little.	O
Yes, shapes almost.	O
And a Willy nilly.	O
Fun fact about beauty and the beast.	O
Did you guys know that all of the gargoyles on the Castle and inside the Castle are all rejected designs of the beast?	O
Um, those are.	O
I don't know if you guys know him.	O
Um, Aaron Blaise is the designer of the beast and I guess it took him a really long time to figure out.	O
What he was going to do for the beef designs and they went through like hundreds of iterations before he actually was asleep one night at his house.	O
He was asleep and he got woken up in the middle of the night and he just had this vision of the final final design of the beast and he immediately got up and he sketched it down and he was like this is beast.	O
This is it and I always thought that story was pretty cool because I mean sometimes that happens sometimes with.	O
Um, with design you know a lot of the time, like I'll try and try and try and, uh, like work really hard to come up with what I'm going to do for my nest next art piece and a lot of the time when I'm just sitting on the couch, not even thinking about it, just watching TV.	O
Suddenly I'll just have this idea like pop into my head and be like, oh, I should do that next.	O
and I just thought that that was a really cool.	O
A really cool thing that you know, like the design of the beast was in his head the whole time, but he had to.	O
He had to come up with it.	O
It had to come to the forefront of his mind.	O
When he wasn't even thinking about it.	O
Hey Caroline, your work?	O
Uh is fantastic.	O
Cody, first time I've watched your stream.	O
Oh thank you so much, appreciate it if you'd like to follow my Instagram, you can.	O
Uh, the link is down below just at Cody Bear.	O
That's where I'm most active online.	O
Uhm, Yeah, right now.	O
This sketch is very very rough.	O
Early stages.	O
It doesn't look like much, but the last illustration that we did on stream was this Cinderella peace and this is pretty much what it will.	O
You can expect the beast piece to look like.	O
Um?	O
At the end I use a lot of like a cran textures in my work, so yeah, this is kind of the look that it will probably turn out.	O
Obviously will be with different colors and stuff like that, but.	O
Yeah, I usually keep my sketching pretty simple.	O
Michael Roos Welcome to the street.	O
How are you?	O
OK.	O
What else?	O
What else we got going on here?	O
What can we add?	O
Oh right, I was going to do the.	O
A little hearth.	O
A little a little wood Holder.	O
I don't know what those are called.	O
'cause I think this whole piece is technically the hearth, right?	O
And then the little little wood rack in the fireplace.	O
So that, like a little more squaddie feet.	O
And.	O
Then Add a little piece that out here.	O
And some great that have some point ease on them.	O
I'm going to space them out a little bit more, actually or like.	O
Then there's like a curve.	O

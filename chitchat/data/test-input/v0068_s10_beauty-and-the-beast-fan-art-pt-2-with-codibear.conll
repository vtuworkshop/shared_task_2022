If that comes up.	O
OK.	O
Not need to draw the whole thing, I can just go ahead and copy.	O
Actually copy and paste the whole thing.	O
Full peace and erase that.	O
An copy and paste this to the other side.	O
Wanna flip it horizontally?	O
And then whoop right on the other side.	O
Then Then it's.	O
And then I can just connect these.	O
And let's see, um, probably draw two more.	O
One right there.	O
And here.	O
OK.	O
Cool so busy.	O
Really lovely pictures.	O
Thank you, appreciate it.	O
I like friends, a friends house fire too.	O
I do too.	O
Um again.	O
Like sometimes I think that something is going to go one way and then my lines just happened to turn out a certain way that day.	O
So I just roll with it so we'll see how the fire goes as we start to sketch it.	O
Uh, OK, and as we did in the Cinderella one, I'm leaving the characters to the last moment.	O
In the sketch I did that on purpose because, um, sometimes I'm like, I'm really slow when it comes to drawing anatomy.	O
I'm not that great at it, so if I forced myself to do the rest of the sketch first, if I have difficulty with anatomy than I am less likely to give up on the image because I've already put so much work into the sketch.	O
So sometimes when I start with the characters and it doesn't workout, I give up immediately, but.	O
If I put work into the image, I just kind of push through it.	O
A lot of the time.	O
So that's why I have yet to draw the characters in.	O
And we did the same thing with Cinderella two.	O
We pretty much through the whole image first.	O
And then we we plopped her in.	O
OK.	O
Uh, OK.	O
I'm I've also been kind of avoiding the.	O
The statue, ladies.	O
On the fireplace, but I think we're going to go ahead and do that next.	O
Or maybe it will do the fire next to the fire next.	O
That's easy.	O
OK.	O
I'm going to locate the saloon.	O
I'm gonna open up both.	O
The both of those image that images but I just showed you guys just so I can.	O
Get a gauge on how I drew the fire last time.	O
Uhm, OK, let me just go ahead and do it on this letter.	O
Um, let's see.	O
And with fire you also want to make sure that they're kind of all.	O
Different sizes and shapes.	O
Um, because you don't want it to look too uniform, right?	O
Um, like?	O
Yeah, no, I don't want that.	O
Go more like this.	O
So a lot of the time I'll kind of go with this triangular shape with.	O
One big one in the middle.	O
And then kind of one that's medium size on the side and then one that smaller on the side.	O
Kind of how?	O

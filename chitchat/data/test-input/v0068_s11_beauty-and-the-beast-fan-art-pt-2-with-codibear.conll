I'll usually do that.	O
You want to make sure that like if you're doing this kind of shape, you want to make sure that the sides aren't even either.	O
Because again, it will probably end up looking a little bit too uniform.	O
And we can also do some little.	O
Little wispy pieces coming off.	O
So in the movie, you actually can't see the logs in the scene.	O
Believe it or not, um.	O
It only shows the fire.	O
However, I think I am going to draw the logs in.	O
'cause it will look more natural.	O
And again, it's just one of those things, like in terms of Animation.	O
They don't always.	O
You're not always going to draw every single detail in every single scene.	O
For one that would take forever and two.	O
It also would detract from the.	O
The focal point of the scene so they don't always Add all of the details in in the background, so that's probably why they didn't add in the logs because it wasn't really necessary.	O
The fire is what would necessary in that scene.	O
The logs were not, but I'm going to add an alarm.	O
Is that rain and Thunder in the background?	O
It's so funny I get like at least one or two people per stream that asks me that yeah, I use uhm for every stream since we can't.	O
We can't play copyrighted music on stream.	O
And I personally just really like listening to ASM are on Beanz backgrounds like nature sounds and cafe sounds and thunderstorm sounds and stuff like that.	O
So if you watch my streams you'll hear a lot of that.	O
I just personally feel like it helps me focus on my art better than listening to music.	O
So yeah.	O
Even your following instead.	O
Thank you so much, I am less than 100.	O
Follows away from 5K by the way guys, when I hit 5K on Instagram I plan on doing a draw this in your style.	O
I don't know if you guys have ever participated in one of those, but basically it's a hashtag event on Instagram where an artist will Draw Something like draw little scene and.	O
Will ask their community who draw that same image, but in their style.	O
So I'm really excited to do that because I haven't hosted one of my own yet.	O
I have participated in a couple of other artists doing theirs, but I haven't done my own and I think that that would be a fun project to do.	O
And if you guys would want to be involved in that.	O
I did it once, was rubbish out it.	O
Hey it's not a competition, it's just fun.	O
I don't know what I'm going to draw for it yet though, haven't decided.	O
And it had the chance to figure it out.	O
It won't be like a full scene like this or anything, it'll just be like a probably a character doing something.	O
It won't be super crazy detailed.	O
Oh, also, let's go ahead.	O

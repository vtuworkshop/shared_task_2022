And so like I said, I'm probably going to be doing a dark background for this, and let's open up the cafe scene because let's open up the.	O
Photo shop file of that.	O
Open.	O
That's a big jump.	O
Because I think I want to use the same.	O
Background color that I did for this scene.	O
OK, it was this one.	O
I want to make sure I get the right one.	O
'cause I had the lighting turned out really nice on the scene so.	O
OK.	O
The background color is going to be like that.	O
And then over top of that, we're going to do my just to give you guys an idea we're going to do my thumb.	O
Overlay lighting layers.	O
So if you guys are new here, what I like to do sometimes for darker images is I will take this kind of like big fluffy cloudy type brush and I will take a more like baby yellow light yellow color.	O
Even make it a little lighter, and then I'm going to turn the UM layer to overlay.	O
Not the brush, but the layer to overlay, and then if you draw.	O
Very lightly.	O
It will give a pretty cool glow effects.	O
And you can always layer it as well.	O
So if we make.	O
The brush a little smaller.	O
And just kind of layer the gradient here.	O
This kind of build upon it for those, for those of you people that wear makeup, kinda like when you're applying blush.	O
You don't want to apply too much at one time, but you just kind of build layers.	O
That's going to be something like that.	O
I'll probably redo it when when the time comes, but I just wanted to give you guys an idea of what it will look like.	O
Uhm yeah, and I did the same thing with that image that you just saw so.	O
As you can see, like beer and here.	O
And along the edge here.	O
That's where I added that glowy light effect, and it works pretty well.	O
I I found I actually, I'm pretty sure I found that out on accident.	O
I think it was like my layer just accidentally was on an overlay and I was like, Oh man, it looks really good.	O
But I haven't used it in a really long time, but ever since I started dreaming on be hands just like a couple months ago, I started using it again and I'm so thankful that I did because it looks really good.	O
I like it.	O
OK anyway.	O
Um, I'm going to go ahead and just leave this light for now, just so I can see what I'm doing.	O
Um, OK, we've put it off long enough people.	O
We gotta do the columns.	O
The pastor I've been going wrong.	O
OK.	O
Um, let's see where should I draw this?	O
Originally?	O
What layer?	O
Here we go layer hunting again.	O
As always.	O
Here we go.	O
Let's go back to my sketch brush.	O
David, thank you.	O
Anyone's working on anything digitally, please save your work.	O
So they got their elbows down.	O

The area wouldn't look lived in, it wouldn't have natural detail like that.	O
I the the example that I gave last time was.	O
Video games, specifically my husband and I have been playing the Last of Us and it's an apocalyptic game, so there's all kinds of trash and all kinds of little things here and there that just like fill up the world that you don't even notice when you're walking by um.	O
But if it wasn't there, you would notice because the world will look would look empty.	O
Um, uh, somebody?	O
Oh it was actually mentioned on the Adobe Live Adobe live stream yesterday.	O
Funny enough, the host Alexis said good design is invisible.	O
Bad design is noticeable, which I feel like is relevant to this conversation too, because again, like you didn't even notice it because it looks natural.	O
That's good design.	O
OK.	O
Next Oh, next we so I haven't put any much detail on the statue ladies, but.	O
I do want to draw this little earn up here.	O
Oh, and I also need to draw in.	O
See let's bring up our thumbnail sketch again here.	O
Um?	O
Hello photo shop.	O
I don't know why it does this sometimes.	O
On my stream.	O
It's only when I try to move a layer only when I try to move a layer, everything else is fine, but sometimes photo shops like no, that's way too much.	O
And it has to like, think about moving the layer.	O
For a really long time.	O
There we go.	O
Um, so here's the thumbnail again.	O
With these big fat head, I do need to draw in this little photo.	O
This little photo frame here on the wall.	O
This is also true in real life.	O
You walk past things without even noticing them, and it's also you know, like.	O
On a day-to-day basis, like art is everywhere, you don't even realize how much art you walk past on a daily basis, like, think about the grocery store.	O
Every single box, every single item.	O
In a grocery store has artwork on it.	O
Somebody designed that box?	O
Somebody designed that packaging and people.	O
Most people don't even think about that.	O
You know, because we're just like we're just so used to it.	O
We're so used to having artwork on everything.	O
And I mean I.	O
I mean, I'm guilty of that.	O
When I was younger, I didn't think about that kind of stuff either.	O
And then it dawned on me like wow.	O
Somebody, somebody, somewhere designed all of these things?	O
But we are so used to seeing it that we don't even notice it.	O
Hum, OK, that looks that looks better.	O
I still really wish that I would note that I knew.	O
That I could know what is above the fireplace.	O
It kind of feels a little weird having the.	O
Um?	O
Wallpaper behind the fireplace because I feel like at least it would probably have.	O
Like a piece of someone eraser, it would probably have a piece like coming up.	O
Like this?	O
Um, like to extends like in the front of the chimney, and there's probably I could imagine that there's probably.	O
Some kind of large painting above there or something like that, but I think what I'm going to going to make the executive decision.	O
Erase.	O
The wallpaper.	O
I almost want to watch the whole movie just to see if I can just to see if I can find any kind of like other scene that has this fireplace in it, but I don't think there is.	O

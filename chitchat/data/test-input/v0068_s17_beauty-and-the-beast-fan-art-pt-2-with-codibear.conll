You're getting so good at this.	O
What if it's possible that going up behind the fireplace is the same texture background as the lower down sort of chimney breast?	O
Yeah, that's kind of what I was planning on doing just.	O
So like this is kind of, I guess it's like a just painted stucco or something like that.	O
It's just white, so I'll probably do that same color up at the top.	O
And you know what?	O
Now that I think about it, a lot of this off section is actually going to be in darkness because all of the light is going to be down here around the fireplace in the characters, so probably not even going to see all that much detail up at the top, so it's probably going to be fine, but right now just everything is a lit so.	O
And.	O
I keep thinking of all the details, but really, in all reality we probably won't even see all that much up there.	O
The concept art.	O
There's a huge broken mirror with a very ornate frame.	O
What looks like to freeze supporting a Royal coat of arms and a big gold chain?	O
Where do you see that Steven link it?	O
Link it in chat if you have like a Google link or something, I'm curious to see what you're looking at.	O
Uh, OK.	O
So oh, they earn.	O
Hum.	O
Let's do that on a separate layer.	O
Let's I'm just going to do part of it.	O
I have like part.	O
Oh gosh, you know what guys I just realized I only have two more minutes in my stream left, um?	O
I completely lost track of time.	O
I'm so sorry about that.	O
Uhm, I just got like.	O
So caught up and.	O
And in doing this I'm actually now that we're at a place where, like there's like it actually looks like a room.	O
I'm getting a little bit more excited about it.	O
Hum.	O
It's actually kind of coming together now.	O
Oh OK, I wanna look at this really quick here.	O
OK, so this concept art Steven, I'm I'm pretty sure this is for the live action movie.	O
This is a much different room.	O
I don't know for sure, but this concept art like I haven't seen the live action.	O
But all of this very swirly curly gold filigree design makes me think of the live action and Fraser because that was very similar to the live action design for Lumiere.	O
So I don't think that this is actually what the animation would have looked like.	O
But that is really cool that some really cool concept art.	O
But yeah, anyway, um made some pretty good progress on this.	O
Uh, next stream, we will do the.	O
Photo frame on the wall and we will probably start drawing in beast and Belle, so that's exciting.	O
Thank you guys so much for watching.	O
Appreciate it.	O
Hey Jennifer, I'm actually just about to end the stream on.	O
So sorry you're popping it in the last second.	O
And yes, I'm going to save a saved, I promise.	O
I know you said it before, but what brush do you use for sketching?	O
I'm still trying to find one that sees me I use uhm with one of Kyle Websters brushes.	O
It's called happy HB.	O
Here it is.	O
It's in Kyle strolling box in the Mega Pack Mega Pack.	O
Happy HB and then I just use the color that I use is kind of like an olive color here I'll just.	O

Good morning, Steve.	O
But Um, if you want to be on the safe mode, simply click on eyedropper tool and pick color from your reference image.	O
Just like that.	O
I will switch back to my watercolor brush in.	O
I will start applying first brushstroke.	O
Actually, I'll love on.	O
This.	O
Brush so, but what I will do I will bring down a passing um size of my brush just like that.	O
God this is watercolor painting.	O
You can go outside of your arm sketch layer.	O
You can and leave.	O
A few are pixels not painted.	O
It's up to you.	O
So this is my first uh, layer of red color for my watermelon, just like that.	O
What I will do I will bring down a pasetti of my layer.	O
Just lightly Ann.	O
Hi Nadia.	O
An idle switch to another watercolor brush.	O
To do so, I will create in you empty out there in I will switch to another watercolor brush.	O
Let's see if I will like this of watercolor brush.	O
If you are not sure if you are like this particular brush in your.	O
Specifically, in your occurrence of painting, simply apply.	O
If you brush strokes are using your sketch layer, so I will select my sketch layer in.	O
I will add if you brush strokes.	O
Actually I like it.	O
I will switch back to my alere I just created with you Anne.	O
I will start working on my watermelon are you can apply short brushstrokes in release your hand if you will do that you will have different.	O
A list of your paint because we are talking about a watercolor painting in.	O
When you are a releasing your hand and starting working on another brush strokes your brush strokes will be over a lapping and this is a beauty of watercolor painting so everything else is up to you.	O
I will bring size of my brush down because I'm coming and going.	O
To apply if you brush strokes closed to ages of my are.	O
Sketch just like that.	O
And a look at these guys because we are working with watercolor brushes, watercolour over the color brushes create will create kind of texture for us.	O
Depends of which watercolor brushes you use.	O
You will have different texture so spend sometimes if you never abort based watercolor brushes in Photoshop.	O
Spent some time to discover your favorite brushes, your favorite texture in everything alike as this I like this base layer.	O
what I will do?	O
Will use same color with darker shade.	O
I opened my color picker an.	O
A panel.	O
Anne, I will use a darker shade of same color just like this.	O
If you're not comfort about using same alert, you can create in you all are actually creating in you, therefore each.	O
In each step of your painting will give you more flexibility.	O
I will show you why I will create a new empty layer.	O
I will increase the size of my brush and I will add a few or brush strokes of a darker color to my watermelon just to like that.	O
And now you can see that we have kind of three dimensional look of our watermelon and this is what I was looking for.	O
And again you can switch between.	O
Bigger in a smaller size of your brush at anytime like I'm doing right now.	O
Remember guys, I mentioned in you a layer.	O
Ah, Hello Caroline.	O
Why, uh, I prefer to use separate all layers.	O
Be cause.	O
If I will decide right now that this darker shade of our red color is too harsh for me, I will bring their own opacity of my layer just like that.	O
Look at this, I don't need to apply.	O
Undo undo, undo or the OR start everything from.	O
From the beginning, I simply cannot adjust a positive.	O
My earlier I can change blend mode or I simply clicking delete my alert.	O
Now I will create a new empty layer.	O
I will use lighter shade of the same red color in.	O

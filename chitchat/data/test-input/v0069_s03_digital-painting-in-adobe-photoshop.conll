I will add a few splashes of highlights to my watermelon slice, just like that.	O
In a look at this.	O
I know, I know Kevin.	O
I just don't want to stop my stream.	O
I apologize for that.	O
I don't know why.	O
I have this a poor quality right now, but I promise I will record same video at today or tomorrow and I will post on my YouTube.	O
I'm so sorry so um.	O
If you like, you can use a uhm.	O
Almost a white, a color to add a few splashes to your our watermelon.	O
Adjust alike as this.	O
I will finish this thing faster than I intended just because of the quality of my stream.	O
Now I will switch to green color.	O
You can use any shade of green color.	O
Everything is up to you.	O
I will use something maybe like this, yes, and using.	O
Thank you, thank you so much and I will create a new empty laran using smaller size of my brush I will.	O
Add if you brush strokes.	O
Just like that in Indian guides we are talking about watercolor painting and don't be afraid to obtain outside of your catch.	O
Um shape each perfectly fine again.	O
If you are working on separate layer, you can simply erase it or you can delete it or a guys it's watercolor painting.	O
I love lose a painting.	O
When I'm working with watercolors now, I will switch to a light shade of yellow color just like that and I will add a few splashes of yellow colors to my watermelon, just like that.	O
A look at this.	O
Anna, maybe I will use.	O
White color to add a few splashes are white colored too as the skin of our my watermelons slides just like this.	O
Look at this.	O
If I will hide my sketch layer.	O
Actually it will help.	O
So at this point I don't need my sketch layer anymore, I am.	O
Uh, this layer of will be hidden if I don't need to bring visibility back, I can do it at anytime, but I will do right now.	O
I will create an UN to layer on top of my olive.	O
I will switch to another brush.	O
Let's see other switch to more appointed watercolor brush.	O
Why?	O
Because I would like to start working on our border Mount seat.	O
To do so I switched to smaller size of.	O
More pointed watercolor brush.	O
I will switch to black colored or guys or I prefer to use darker shade of blue color.	O
I don't like using a poor black color and using as his brush.	O

Look at these guys.	O
How easy is it?	O
Just if you see it.	O

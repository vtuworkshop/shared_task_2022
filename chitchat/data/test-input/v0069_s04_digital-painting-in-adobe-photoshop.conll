If you never painted in Photoshop, just follow me.	O
Just started working with some other color brushes right now in a door for the shop.	O
So guys, what else I would like to add if you light splashes of color around my motor Mount skin so I will create a new empty layer always, you know, ma'am, I will switch to a white color.	O
An eye view, uh, just like that.	O
and I will specify.	O
Just transition between a watermelon and watermelon skin just like that.	O
Guys, if you have any questions please just ask.	O
I will be more than happy answers to any of your equations.	O
And we're almost done.	O
What I will do I will switch to lighter shade of green color.	O
Again guys, you can use any shade of Green a color.	O
Everything is up to you and I will add a few splashes of color around here just like that.	O
And because I'm using tablet, I'm using a Wakeham tablet.	O
I have pressure sensitivity, pressure sensitivity, a very helpful.	O
And one more step.	O
I'm Rob um.	O
I'm not a big fan of fan of changing a pasetti of my brush.	O
97% in my painting workflow I never changing opacity of my brush because if you will change our passage of your brush you will have overlapping effect.	O
So each brush stroke will overlap in other brush if it what you wanted, that's perfect.	O
Usually I'm bringing down a pasetti of am I a layer?	O
Some are using us a few splashes of our white a color.	O
I will add a few final steps to my watermelon just like that.	O
Now let's talk about our background.	O
Uhm, I will highlight my uh, regional background player with white color on it.	O
I will create a new empty layer.	O
I will switch to an in other watercolor brush.	O
Again guys, you don't have to use a one or brush in your entire painting in your entire document you can switch between different types of brushes.	O
Thank you Rob.	O
Now I will start working on um, shadow under, uh, my watermelon first shadow.	O
There will be a light.	O
Shade of Gray color I will bring us size of my brush down in I will add a few splashes of shadow just like that now are up and this is what I'm talking about hiring them.	O
Thank you Robin.	O
This is what I was talking about when I said I never changing it.	O
Mostly never changing.	O
Opacity of my brush I will creating you empty layer in you and tell her I will use darker shade of.	O
Blue color, you can use darker shade of purple color, any color.	O
Why I'm using?	O
Darker shade of purple or a blue car for my eye shadow instead of arm pura black color because I prefer to use cold colors for a mile shadows and I'm not a big fan of a poor blackers beatifically in impressionist painting.	O
An inner watercolors.	O
So I will use darker shade of.	O
Blue color in I will add few brushstrokes under my watermelon now Rob.	O
This shadow it's too harsh for me because I will need to apply stored our layer of shadow.	O
So this this second layer is too harsh for me.	O
Instead of changing opacity of my layer and paint after I will bring down.	O
Instead of changing opposite of my brush and paint always all over oppositive my brush I created in you empty layer and now I will bring down a pasetti of my lair and I don't have any overlapping.	O
In fact effect and this is what I was looking for.	O
Now I will create a new empty layer.	O
I will bring size of my brush down in I will add.	O

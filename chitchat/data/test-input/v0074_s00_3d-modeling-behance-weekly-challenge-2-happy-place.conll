Sheratons another streamer here on Behance should go check out the profilebehance.net Ford Slash.	O
Sheraton election do some really cool 2D stuff and.	O
Jordans got this sci-fi character that she's been working on which is coming out real cool.	O
Real quick, I'm going to run you through my references.	O
What I'm looking for in each of them and how we're going to approach doing this.	O
Looking at the this initial fireplace, I really like the stone detail here.	O
I don't want anything too crazy, so as opposed to keeping the top stone as well, we're actually going to go instead for a big piece of.	O
Would.	O
I forget the name for this kind of wood.	O
Right, you know?	O
Am I doing?	O
I'm doing alright, I gotta.	O
I'm feeling a little bit of the old artist block.	O
I gotta be honest but this isn't weed.	O
By the way, this is dried Moss.	O
I needed it for reference for something, I promise.	O
Little bit of a block today, but hopefully work through that off stream actually worked on some materials and alchemists.	O
I got the The Hearthwood done here.	O
How much we're going to use as a cross beam of the top?	O

Come also got a bark done for our actual fire firewood here.	O
Got a bit of A.	O
There's other materials go just a quick stone.	O
I think.	O
I'll leave a simple something like this.	O
I'd love to work on that on stream and show you guys that, but for whatever reason, every time I work in that program while I'm streaming my microphone quality just goes out the window.	O
Yeah, trying to keep the.	O

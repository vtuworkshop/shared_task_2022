Something a little quick, then.	O
A little bit of blocking out here.	O
We got the.	O
In column pillars they aren't done yet.	O
I just wanted to get their basic shape in just to see how they look.	O
I want to have all sorts of.	O
Details, Little Kinks and chips if I can.	O
And then we kind of certain blackout that.	O
The bigger part with their.	O
I think we're going to do.	O
Now maybe just quickly.	O
Block out the rest of the fireplace here.	O
Just sort of basic size and shape and right now I'm not completely decided as to.	O
How much of this I'm going to live up to the material.	O
Think probably most of it, so we might honestly just keep a big.	O
Big square here.	O
How about we will do though is we're gonna go ahead and reverse our faces just so that box is facing it.	O
Works like that.	O
And honestly, that's not too bad.	O
All right?	O
Yeah, probably gonna be a little more laxer St.	O
They will try to get enough work done though.	O
Yeah, next I think I kind of just.	O
Just to do something.	O
Kind of quick and easy, and I think I'm going to workout just a piece of firewood.	O
It's kind of getting ahead of myself.	O
I've been jumping around with this all day, working, working on materials and modeling or should just do one and finish it, but.	O
But I said a little bit out of it.	O
My workflow might be a little funny.	O
That you forgive me for that.	O
We're not worried about sites right now, just.	O
Sorry about that.	O
I think we're going to do is we're just going to double this.	O
Play extreme at.	O
Chunks that might be a little bit too.	O
2 uniform though.	O
Let's go the route of cutting up a cylinder instead.	O
Will make sure I get a.	O
He had a vision here I still have.	O
Perfect.	O
Words what's up with them?	O
Now what we can do is we can just go ahead and delete like 3 extra sections here.	O
We got ourselves to start to a piece of wood.	O
Looking good.	O
Yeah I did that round clips.	O
Now I'm sorry.	O
Yeah, and perception.	O
And.	O
I'm thinking I'm thinking here.	O
Red real quick.	O
We're going to actually delete this.	O
Just because I want to.	O
It's just not gonna work, is it?	O
Hold on, we're going to go all the way back, because cylinders cylinders be hard sometimes.	O

Could be honest.	O
We're going to do this at the front back.	O
Yeah, we're going to go ahead and grab bar tops here and do it tonight like that.	O
That would be bad.	O
Nice.	O
Reading like a support group here just so we can multicut along this face cleanly.	O
It's kind of annoying.	O
Smoke must be done, must not be done.	O
What must be done?	O
You know it's kinda hot.	O
Just gonna use that as an excuse.	O
Too hot speak.	O
Going down here.	O
And I think we decided.	O
Two was decent amount there.	O
She still the same.	O
And rectory were five minutes ago, just great.	O
Just this time with an extra cut.	O
Let's have a little bit of fun with this.	O
See I kinda want to lay it on its side.	O
Like So should be alright.	O
Let's see all right?	O
Few things I'm kind of kind of had a little rich here.	O
And that will be our bark.	O
And.	O
No, it's not that thick.	O
I don't really think I want to.	O

Just to see.	O
Like maybe just a little bit.	O
You just a little bit.	O
No, I don't think so.	O
Maybe, maybe not along these faces, but on the sides here.	O
Let me know you guys think it needs it.	O
Like Do it.	O
And we're going to leave the cut in there anyways.	O
'cause that will just help us.	O
Help us assigner materials when I get to that point that will make it a little bit easier for us, so we're going to do now is going to add just a whole bunch of cats.	O
Going to start I don't know deforming this bad boy in a few different ways.	O
She got pretty even geometry.	O
Lumidee I've been playing that right how you doing?	O
So we're going to sell that out and.	O
Hey Sam, how's it going?	O
And we're going to hit this with a lattice box.	O
Would you do bro?	O
Right now I am.	O
What about 3D modeling for this weeks challenge on their hands?	O
What does everyone do?	O

Everyone say what you do be?	O
Yeah, making little fireplace here and at the moment working on some logs.	O
Speak in front.	O
I shouldn't create this lattice blocks and this is just going to make it.	O
Fair bit easier for us to manipulate the shape of this would here.	O
So rather than moving around, the Verts are self, we can kind of move around this little control box and it will move everything inside just the way it needs to be so I can give it a little bit more of a natural look.	O
It's Amy fast.	O
Let us.	O
That is not true.	O
I am pretty slow when it comes to my work.	O
I gotta be honest.	O
Slow in there.	O
And mostly abandoned is my motto.	O
You should have them in order.	O
That's gotta be more than half of project as I started I just do not finish.	O
It's rough sometimes.	O
We probably could have used an extra.	O
Lattice point here.	O
Just take a look at the.	O
It's not fancy yet.	O
I get it.	O
Don't worry about it.	O
This campaign is terrible.	O
It's horrible.	O
But right now I said, what if we did like a low Poly thing and I remember it?	O
When materials are all hyper realistic so.	O
I say hyper realistic.	O
That's implying that they're good, but they're necessary, but just done in a realistic style.	O
It should say, although we could.	O
You know, now I'm playing with the idea of like a little low Poly fireplace, but.	O
I don't know how much of that is me wanting to do something stylized versus me not wanting to make this little log look good, so.	O
I don't know.	O
We're going to do everything here, though I think we're going to.	O
Make a few changes before we lattice this.	O
Deleting everything manually like some sort of mad lad, let's just get rid of her box, get back to it was.	O
To have should be.	O
This part.	O
Is Prince greatest problems?	O
I gotta be honest.	O
You like quads here.	O
This is not a quad.	O
I mean there tries.	O
They aren't bad, but we're going to get a lot of pinching in this corner.	O
The way it's set up correctly.	O
That's not ideal.	O
So we're going to try and solve this.	O
These things are just kind of like a little puzzle.	O
Figuring out here topography.	O
I for one, have never been great at puzzles.	O
I don't know the solution here.	O
I gotta be honest.	O
You see, there's like.	O
To see how this is going to help, How do I?	O
How do I do this?	O
This is the solution.	O
Have super water that will come to us then.	O
Speak.	O
OK, sit up straight.	O
Yep.	O
In about this we don't want.	O
You can we already got.	O
He got some problems.	O
Big Brown Stew Kind of a flat top here.	O
We don't want this.	O
We have such a point, so I'm going to try.	O
That we experimented in here, OK?	O
The problem I have with a lot of.	O
Tutorials or things?	O
You might see you and watching like 3D modeling or I'm sure pretty much any discipline far it is.	O
The people doing this tutorials typically have done the project they're doing before, and they're just going through it a second time with you.	O
So you don't often get to see a lot of problem solving.	O
It's obviously not always the case, but I feel like most of the time she watched these people under like instantly know exactly what function is to happen next, and they never hit CTRL Zeke so they know exactly what to do, and it's just it's not really like that.	O

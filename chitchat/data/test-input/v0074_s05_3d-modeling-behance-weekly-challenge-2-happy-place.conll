Let's look at our.	O
It's almost like there's a gap going on if we tried that instead, 'cause it's not sticking out any further, is it?	O
It's just.	O
And it might separate fine when we get the material on, but I just feel like there needs to be something sets it apart from.	O
The rest of the model here.	O
It's true that part.	O
It might have a decaf with cream to push the bridge there.	O
Proficiency Test told you.	O
Mixed accent.	O
Don't know, don't care, that's the spear tag What if instead of meddling we heard about Nick Stern and we do?	O
Who are these bad voice?	O
So it feels like it's kind of extruded.	O
And it's just so uniform.	O
Sorted out Thank you.	O
I hate this song.	O
This is so repetitive.	O
I gotta get some new Neptune today.	O
Extrude and add termites.	O
God support would.	O
I really want to show you the materials we have for this, but.	O
You know?	O
When will you guys be able to hear me so I can't use the software?	O
No.	O
And if we do one of these instead already screwed up daily.	O
Yeah.	O
Turn it off, said he did little translate.	O
See the problem is I'm going into this with the mindset of.	O
Into a lot of hard surface modeling and.	O
Things that would be machine made if they're real.	O
So they're all very uniform, which is not foul.	O
Thanks be in nature, so we're going to have to do our best to.	O
Sort that out.	O
I think we're on to something here though to be honest.	O
Got high hopes.	O
To find our function.	O
No no no.	O
Show me this year.	O
Script run doing it the nearest want.	O
I just wanted to push it in a little bit more.	O
How do you stuff is going on today?	O
Don't show the textures yet.	O
I'm avoiding it.	O
best I can, but as much as I want to because there's a lot of fun and I want to do more of it, but.	O
You know or something up?	O
Search Internet one day.	O
Sure, I don't everyone what we got already.	O
Alright, you know what?	O
I think this is the way to go.	O
So it looks like Greek to me, but I dig it.	O
That's a nice thing if you ever if you ever get into 3D modeling and someone like walks by like man.	O
I need to impress some people.	O
It's so easy 'cause all you have to do is.	O
She to find out what happened to your model.	O
There you go, you just press a button and go into wireframe mode and they're like, Oh, fancy.	O
Just take it to the people going I guess.	O
We see that wire frame just.	O
Mr.	O
Crazy.	O
Excellent naming scheme here.	O
From the groups I got the fireplace and then the not fireplace.	O
So we got, you know, if we got a decent decent start for what is a piece of wood.	O
I think we can make this work.	O
Is me basically saying I think it's time to.	O
Kind of the lattice hacker mode engaged exactly.	O
It's like goes to go straight to like 80s.	O
Terrible 80s movie really thought of.	O

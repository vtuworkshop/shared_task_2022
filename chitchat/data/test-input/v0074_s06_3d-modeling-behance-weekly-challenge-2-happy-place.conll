Show me cheap wire frame early 3D models with a substitute for good special effects.	O
I say he's probably like early 90s.	O
Cough cough lawnmower man cough cough.	O
See.	O
Hi.	O
That wire frame, though I gotta see how Mika, a good model and it's.	O
Things mindlessly.	O
Right, so I'm procrastinating.	O
Is going to save before you forget that.	O
Social learning.	O
We go back.	O
The form of the lattice.	O
Mr.	O
Their decision seriously have few more things.	O
Are you?	O
You don't want too many, otherwise it's just.	O
It's too many it do anything.	O
That wire frame I'm swooning.	O
Who are law so fancy?	O
I'll see here.	O
We go to lattice points.	O
Now we can clean it.	O
Hennessy, we're looking at this piece of wood shake here, which is a nice piece of wood.	O
Let's get to it.	O
I'm going to kind of match that.	O
I'm going to temper some expectations right now.	O
This isn't going to look fantastic.	O
We're not going to go in and sculpt all the beautiful.	O
Chip detail and all that.	O
We just kinda weak.	O
OK gotta go quick, we gotta we can I top of that time.	O
Add a little bit of artist block so.	O
We're going to do.	O
We can do.	O
Looking at this, actually I'm going to want a few more.	O
Divisions of whatever the hell this axis is going to be.	O
Which we need to explore resizing every tweet.	O
So excited.	O
You Thank you.	O
Last week she look.	O
That many alright.	O
Nice piece of what shape to it?	O
Well.	O
He talking about.	O
It's a great piece of would like it kind of like lives to the little bit good form.	O
Print color as well.	O
I'm going to leave it there pretty challenge.	O
My immature just good stuff.	O
I think it would probably take you on.	O
Actually grab.	O
Press.	O
This might be too much work with here.	O
So so it doesn't help them stop kind of sitting funny.	O
I'd rather the well.	O
Spend.	O
It's kind of sort this out.	O
You don't need to be like we're not looking for.	O
Precision or anything?	O
Here we're just trying to give it a little bit more of an organic looks so.	O
You don't have to match it perfectly.	O
Just want to give it a little bit of noise.	O
Now, if you.	O
Just doing this project for realsies like for real for real.	O
Turn on, probably take it into a little bit of sculpting like I'm just thinking how easy or be in Z brush just to.	O
You don't look that damn standard, you know.	O
Keep it nice.	O
Flat edges here and there.	O
Come to myself, trying not to.	O

That said, I'm going to jump right into what I typically do is work on a social media promo for the same band.	O
The Black ties essentially implementing effects animation into each of the film clips that are featured in one of their promos.	O
So let's get started.	O
Just give me 1 second here.	O
OK, so for anybody that's not familiar with my process or is not familiar with any of the live streams that I do.	O
If this is your first time tuning in, thank you, um, I'm putting together a one minute social media promo featuring the black ties in a cover that they did of one of their songs.	O
Whether it be an original or a cover of a classic rock song.	O
In this case it's Hallelujah.	O
I love her so and each of the clips.	O
Most of the time when I do social media promos there more film based like the one that you just saw for the Happy Birthday Ringo video.	O
But in this case I wanted to add effects animation elements to each of the clips.	O
So for the purposes of these live streams, so I'm going to show you the progress I've made so far with this clip and we'll go from there.	O
Good burger.	O
Nobody.	O
So.	O
Baby.	O
So recently I've been working on going back to older clips and seeing what I can do to revise them further and simultaneously.	O
I've also been prepping new clips, you know, adding new track mattson motion tracking so I can implement any color corrections in animation to be composited into the footage wherever it is.	O
If it's on the instruments, if it's behind the musicians, depending on what the focus of the shot is and.	O
Let me take a quick look at the timeline because I'm trying to decide what clip to go with next.	O
I'm thinking that maybe I should do a pickup of one of the earlier clips to start with.	O
I hope you guys can hear me now.	O
The microphone was a little bit tilted the other way, so, uh.	O
Looks like my levels are fine.	O
I could see them.	O
OK, so.	O
That's one of the ones I worked on the last time.	O
Uh.	O
I wonder if that one needs something 'cause I was looking at that I've been looking at that clip, wondering if maybe there was some way to bring out the drums a little bit more.	O
It looks like they're composited out.	O
Perhaps see if I can immerse them, make you activate them in a sense.	O
Using color and animation.	O
So what number is that?	O
#14 OK, so I'm going to jump right in here.	O
Uh, that's one of the new clips I've been tracked.	O
Metting.	O
That's Brian.	O
Say hello to Brian.	O
OK, so #14.	O
Yeah, this is the one.	O
I'm just thinking that something needs to happen with the drum kit.	O
I think at the time I was thinking that the focus should be on the Animations coming forth from the drum kit, but as I'm looking at it now, there needs to be some sort of.	O
Anticipation before those first come forth.	O
So I'm going to take a real quick look at how this is arranged and then go from there.	O
By the way, those little graphics you saw at the beginning in the end of the Happy Birthday video, uh, those were I put those in myself.	O
I thought it would be fun to make the yellow submarine a candle, so I actually filmed the candle, composited the flame in.	O

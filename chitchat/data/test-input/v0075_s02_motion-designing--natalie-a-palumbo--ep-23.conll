It was fun.	O
Oh, Kelvin Martinez, thank you for following me.	O
OK, so.	O
That's the drum kit right there.	O
That's at least the Alpha Channel for the drum kit.	O
Now, if I could find the motion track it's parented to that one perfect great, great.	O
OK, so we know where are drunk, it is.	O
I'm going to duplicate it.	O
And I'm going to take a quick set of water, hold on a second.	O
I think I jetted out there, you guys?	O
I got this thermostat Adobe Max.	O
It was a.	O
It was a little free beat all the top talents.	O
Oh Scatty Joseph, thank you for following me.	O
Anyway, I use it all the time I just love it.	O
I've got the got the Adobe logo invented on the Thermas and it's just really pretty.	O
OK.	O
So, uhm, I'm already looks like I'm still.	O
OK, that's duplicated, that's parented to 25 K Perfect.	O
I want to ensure that the processing is I want to ensure that the process is non destructive.	O
When I do make revisions to something, so that's why we're duplicating the layers and making sure that the nulls are parented and attached to the right layers, and otherwise if if you make adjustments to the base layer and then you decide that it's a huge mistake.	O
It could be problematic unless you know how to get it back or you saved your previous version.	O
In other words, always have a back up.	O
I find that's the best style.	O
The best way to go about working on projects is to ensure you have a back up plan.	O
Oh, I just got my first comment in the chat.	O
Scotty, Joseph Wrights welcome.	O
Well, thank you for tuning in and thank you for the follow.	O
OK, so I'm going to pre compose this.	O
We're gonna call this drum Alpha.	O
Just keep it simple.	O
All right?	O
So I'm going to solo it out.	O
At least I'm going to try to.	O
There we go.	O
That's what supposed to appear.	O
OK, good.	O
I'm going to remove the Hue and saturation because I'm pondering.	O
I'm pondering playing with the actual color values of the footage in order to bring out animation elements 'cause there's another clip I worked on where you can really see the burst coming off of the drum kit, so I wanted to have the same energy.	O
Is that one?	O
You know vary it up of course, but same energy.	O
We want all the animations to be different but cohesive.	O
You know the color motif maintains a consistency, but the Animations Varian, where they appear varies.	O
Let's see.	O
What kind of animation element I keep saying like?	O
Line burst from the center, but I want to listen to the timing of the audio before I decide when it should come in.	O
So give me 1 second.	O
Of course, now that I'm playing with it, it's, uh, it's got to be re rendered 'cause of the dynamic link?	O
But I actually do love the dynamic link because you can make adjustments in after effects and it will maintain its timing in the Premier timeline.	O

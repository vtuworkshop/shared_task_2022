Which is really helpful, especially if you're trying to time with music.	O
It's more precise if you can do it that way.	O
I find it's a lot easier.	O
OK.	O
So it looks like.	O
If I'm going based on the audio here.	O
I love this song.	O
It's one of my favourites it some.	O
Originally by Ray Charles and The Beatles, did a cover.	O
Of is real to reel back when they were teenagers and it was a wrong recording, but you could tell they were pitch perfect the whole time they were singing it.	O
I mean, this was.	O
You know, back in the early days and they were just practicing with each other, it was just.	O
Incredible.	O
But I always love that song and their cover is fantastic.	O
By the way, if you want to see the live stream featuring the little birthday video that we did, it's on the black ties Facebook page, which is the link is in the description below.	O
If you want to take a look at that, I would highly recommend it.	O
If you're a fan of 50, sixty 70s classic rock, they are fantastic musicians and I love working with them so.	O
Alright, so it looks like.	O
2 seconds or two frames in it looks like.	O
'cause it's the 30th of a second, so two 30th of a second in and then.	O
1 second and one frame, so two and then 101.	O
Easy to remember.	O
OK.	O
So.	O
2.	O
Wonder how I can mark that?	O
Tell you what I can go to the null.	O
Well, it's already got points here.	O
I'm going to go and just make another null.	O
I know there's a way to make markers in after effects, but, uh.	O
To this day, I'm not sure how you're supposed to do it.	O
Hang out, it's like maybe I can find it out.	O
You know what?	O
I'm not going to keep you guys waiting though.	O
I'll figure it out some other time.	O
It's funny my rescue kitten Jeremy figured out how to do it and he was just running across the keys.	O
I don't even know how he did it.	O
And 101 perfect.	O
So we've got our timing.	O
At least we got markers here so we can rely on that.	O
At least visually, that works for me.	O
I'm sure there's a better way, but.	O
Invisible drummer.	O
OK, so.	O
Go ahead, do something here.	O
OK, let's see.	O
Let's say the center is that symbol over there.	O
Oh, uh, looks like there's another message in this chat from Milagro Dia Lopez.	O
That name looks really familiar.	O
I'm pretty sure that they were in a previous live stream, uh, and they just said hi, Natalie, Hawaii.	O
Thank you for tuning in.	O
Uh, let me know if I'm pronouncing your name correctly, by the way.	O
And that goes for anybody whose name I mentioned.	O
If I mention your name at all during the broadcast, let me know if I'm pronouncing it correctly out of respect to anybody that's tuning in.	O
But again, thank you.	O
Alright, so I'm going to take the.	O
Actual position of it.	O
I'm going to put it right over the this anchor point here, so I'll have an easier time moving it.	O
Long story short.	O

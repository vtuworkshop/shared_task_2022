I've worked for this program along time and I've got the scars to prove it.	O
Alright, so.	O
I'm gonna solo this out because I want to try creating an animation effect with it.	O
So let's see.	O
So I want to move it there.	O
Want to move it there?	O
'cause then the anger point moves with us.	O
It just makes things a lot easier if you do it that way.	O
The one thing I do want to do is I want to see that symbol.	O
Let's make it 15 seconds.	O
I'm going to move it out.	O
To the edge.	O
But the other thing I'm going to do.	O
I'm also going to do this.	O
No, not that.	O
Wrong percentage.	O
But that's OK, it's irreversible.	O
Or no, it's reversible.	O
Irreversible is when it's not fixable.	O
That's when you don't have an undo button.	O
OK.	O
I'm going to speed it up just a little bit.	O
So it really feels like a burst.	O
I'm also going to do this.	O
You know what?	O
Instead of having it get larger as it goes across.	O
I'm going to have it start large and diminish, so really feels like a symbol.	O
Or at the very least, very heavy drum beat.	O
I need to feel like a boom.	O
Oh, uh, milagros right?	O
No worries haha.	O
Yes, I was in another live a few weeks ago.	O
Thank you for remembering me.	O
I really like you work.	O
Hope to see more of you know.	O
Well, thank you, um, just to let you know and anybody else it's tuning in.	O
I regularly live stream.	O
Tuesdays and Thursdays starting at 9:00 PM eastern Standard Time.	O
6:00 PM Pacific Time and based on those time zones, you might be able to decipher when when it shows up in your time zone.	O
'cause I know that you know this is an international platform and people are coming from everywhere and that's the amazing thing about the hands.	O
So if you're able to tune in fantastic, you know I would love to see you.	O
In the upcoming ones, but if you can't, don't worry, these will be archived on my channel, so you can look at them afterwards if you're not able to for any reason.	O
If you have to do work, or if you have to finish a project, it's OK.	O
But no, that's really sweet of you.	O
Thank you so much for saying that.	O
I like, Uh, I like seeing people in Susie Astic about watching my creative process for the social media promos that just warms my heart so.	O
An Chris Perry writes high from Auckland, New Zealand.	O
Now I do remember he was in a prior live stream.	O
It's good to see you again.	O
Thank you for tuning in Chris.	O
OK.	O
And then we're going to have to finish on the other end.	O
Alright boom.	O
OK.	O
So.	O
First of all, I'm going to change the color.	O

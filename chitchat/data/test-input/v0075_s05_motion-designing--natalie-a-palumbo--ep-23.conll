I might actually.	O
Alter the color as it's moving across, like have a great from a lighter tone to a darker tone.	O
Maybe I could at least try it.	O
Alright, let's see.	O
I'm going to take it from A.	O
A light tone.	O
Two more Gray tones, so it takes on.	O
Like a blue overall, like an overall glue tone afterwards, 'cause we're going to.	O
We're going to do some color correction to this so it matches the overall motif.	O
So let me take a look here.	O
Sorry, said only.	O
Right adjustment that I need.	O
Boom OK.	O
And then echo.	O
I'm going to see if this works.	O
And then said that 20.	O
Oh well, I wasn't expecting that, but that's kind of cool.	O
I could work that could definitely work.	O
There's some things I would want to do to it though.	O
Oh Milagros right so oh, and I love your Adobe thermas my my thermas and I thank you.	O
I can't help but think back on when I was over at Adobe Max in Los Angeles and how wonderful that was up to anybody that's watching.	O
If you're able to go to any of the events, if they do resume.	O
Go, you will have a fantastic time.	O
You know I love feeling energized and ready to work again and the day that I got back I was filming the black ties for, UM, documentary segment that I was working on which features them.	O
So I was interviewing them, asking them questions and.	O
You know it was just wonderful the whole thing, but I just left feeling like I just wanted to create everything and you want to feel that way when you come back from something like that so.	O
Checking out the different modes here.	O
Uh, let's see.	O
Perhaps a little more delay on it might be good.	O
Boom I think it needs to be a little thinner at the end, like it really needs to taper off as if you're it's really diminishing over there.	O
'cause right now I can still sort of see it.	O
No, don't want to do that.	O
Boom We don't want it to be that close to if you don't want that to be.	O
It's so inward that it doesn't touch the edge 'cause we wanted to go over the drums.	O
Yeah, more like that, more like that.	O
You know more even, but clearly defining where the source is coming from.	O
So.	O
See ad.	O
Now that I think about it, maybe the colour should be a little darker, so when they do mix you can really see.	O
Be intertwining the brighter colors in between.	O
Well.	O
Perhaps the decay had everything to do with it.	O
Now I don't know if it should be that graded it out, but.	O
That is a little more graceful, but maybe too much.	O
I'm picturing the animation being masked inside of the drum kit, kind of bursting.	O

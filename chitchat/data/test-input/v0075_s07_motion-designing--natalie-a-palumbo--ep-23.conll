180 Mrs should be a 180.	O
So where did it go?	O
You know what I'm doing this all wrong.	O
There is an adjustment for this.	O
I think what ended up happening was literally the the shape was rotated and not necessarily the size of the comp, so the block didn't end up on the other side.	O
I'm more used to working with solids than I am with shapes, 'cause typically I work with more mass than I do with shapes in.	O
After effects, but I do do it sometimes and in this case I I've been doing it a lot more because of certain animation verse that involves shapes in the you know, in the first place.	O
Alright, so.	O
Now I'm going to move it over just a little bit, so it's really.	O
Boom Seamlessly from the middle.	O
All right and then.	O
We're going to take this.	O
And.	O
Now, we can't.	O
We're going to take it in and apply it to another.	O
Going to parent it to annul, so we're not.	O
We're not eliminating any keyframes on the position of that layer.	O
So.	O
I see no.	O
Going to parents and all and then.	O
Maybe I should, just you know what it's because of the mirror effects that it's doing that.	O
OK, so rather than do that I'm going to.	O
This is tricky 'cause.	O
How old is this comp?	O
OK, so it's 1080.	O
Wanna bump it up to double the size?	O
That way I can grab the whole shape.	O
Oh Well, that's simple enough.	O
I could just take this.	O
Stick it in a pre cough.	O
Or not.	O
Now.	O
I made a huge mistake.	O
Alright, so.	O
I ended up recomposing the null and not the actual safe layer.	O
Alright drum first.	O
Thank you.	O
Alright, so.	O
It should, yeah, that's what we want.	O
Right now that we've done that, we can, uh, put the precompact too.	O
Back to 1920.	O
And when I come to find is.	O
She wanted to emanate from that center there.	O
Boom It's actually gotta stretch further across the canvas, so here's what I'm going to do.	O
I'm going to save it.	O
And I'm going to add a new viewer.	O

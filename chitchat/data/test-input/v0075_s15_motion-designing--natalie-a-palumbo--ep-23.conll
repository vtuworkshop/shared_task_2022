Well, it's rendering.	O
I know honey, but I have to broadcast.	O
He's a little Munchkin.	O
He was named after the character in yellow submarine, the nowhere man.	O
Uh.	O
In that film, and he's just like the character he's got that exuberant energies, playful and very chatty's, uh.	O
I'm not sure if you guys can hear it on your end, but he is chatting up the storm with Maine.	O
Speaking of yellow submarine, I think it's a good time, good time to mention, um, the dress I designed and what I'm wearing for this episode.	O
So I like to show off for anybody that's not familiar.	O
I like to show off dresses that I have designed in the past.	O
So this one I actually designed based off of the clouds in Pepper Land and it's a little wraparound dress for the frill at the bottom.	O
It's got the cloud texture and the submarine on the skirt and dumb.	O
It was one of my favorite parts of the film because it's really like the texture is really the Sea of holes, but it turns into the sun in the clouds and it's just gorgeous.	O
And um.	O
I ended up wearing this to go see Ringo Starr at Wolf Trap in Virginia and that was a fantastic experience.	O
We were so close to the stage and I had my hands over my head.	O
I was filming the stage and I wanted to make sure that I was really capturing the musicians well and I got footage of this.	O
Ringo, Sami 'cause we were pretty close to the stage where a couple rows back he saw me holding my camera up like this my phone.	O
Any minds it back to me and I didn't know it was going to do that.	O
I didn't know he could see me, but that's rolled me to bits and, uh, so I thought it was apropos because it's his 80th birthday.	O
I thought I should wear this because I went to go see him.	O
You know, in address I designed.	O
And it was a wonderful, wonderful time.	O
A splendid time with guaranteed for all.	O
OK anyway.	O
Yes.	O
So I'm just going to do highlights only.	O
We do kind of like that.	O
It's shining up the.	O
Yeah, the instruments quite a bit.	O
Little bit of am a little bit of ambient glow.	O
But I wonder if.	O
Oh, that little bit of highlight.	O
That little bit of emphasis.	O
Looks really nice.	O
It brings out the texture of that dramatist.	O
I don't know it just.	O
That read write to me 'cause you really see the sign on the symbols we want that was going to make sure it looks good.	O
I like it.	O
I think the animation verse to.	O
Might be a little too bright now, but that can easily be adjusted before it gets to the glow.	O
'cause I I do not want to mess with the shine on the symbols.	O
That looks great, although one thing I could do.	O
If I'm going to do it this way.	O
Have two separate gloves.	O
One on just the drums and one on just the symbols.	O
For that matter, I should have done that in the beginning, but.	O
This whole process.	O
Although if I remember correctly, this was underneath an Alpha channel, so.	O
I'm gonna.	O
Do one thing here.	O
Alright, so where is 18 its motion?	O
It's parented to the motion tracking all Witches Layer 18.	O
OK, so.	O
Precomposed that Drum trails alright.	O
Or simply yet.	O

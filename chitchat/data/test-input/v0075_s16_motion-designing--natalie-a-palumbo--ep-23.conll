Rather than do that.	O
I'm not sure what happened here.	O
It's bizarre.	O
It's actually showing up the way it was supposed to initially when I started.	O
Remember when I wanted to have it only on the top side of the symbol.	O
Strangely enough, it's working now that is a precomposed.	O
It's bizarre, but.	O
I don't know, so I keep going in that direction.	O
Or do I do something else?	O
But what's strange is it shows up here.	O
That that reads right to Maine.	O
That looks nice.	O
Yes, OK, that works for Maine, 'cause it really.	O
It feels vibrant.	O
You see the ambient glow but it doesn't eliminate the texture at all.	O
Let me just make sure that it looks good when it goes over.	O
I like the ending part where the blue kind of goes over.	O
Everything is like a wave of blue.	O
Even on the drumsticks, which is really, really nice, it's a nice touch.	O
I don't know I I kind of like this.	O
'cause it kinda feels like the burst is exploding and.	O
Um, dispersing over all the other other instruments, including I believe that's Benz guitar.	O
'cause Anthony is the drummer.	O
I think Ben was standing next to him so.	O
What happened here?	O
OK.	O
Something is not Alpha channel doubt.	O
That's got an Alpha channel.	O
It's probably yes, probably this.	O
Or is it?	O
No, it's not.	O
Then what is, oh, you know what it's?	O
I think it's so loadout, or was it?	O
Wait a minute.	O
Alright, so.	O
What is causing that effect?	O
It's obviously that layer whatever is going on here.	O
Oh, a milaeger right?	O
It works well, thank you.	O
Yeah, this is more of an experimental revision 'cause I wanted to see what I could do to activate the drum kit.	O
Using that high energy.	O
Of those drum beats.	O
'cause it really.	O
I mean you really hear them in that section, so I wanted to really play with that timing.	O
But thank you.	O
I just gotta make sure what is going on here now.	O
Why is there no Alpha channel here?	O
I know what it is.	O
It's a very simple thing.	O
If the pre multiply the glow.	O
All right?	O
That's one multiplied, so that should be.	O
That should be a yeah, that's.	O
The other one wasn't.	O
It was displaced over.	O
That's why it's not working.	O
Next end not generate extend there we go much better.	O
Now we have our Alpha channel.	O
And now.	O
Now we can see Anthony.	O
Now there's another.	O
There's another drum kit somewhere in here that I have to turn off.	O
Not drumsticks.	O
I like the drumsticks those those drumsticks had a really nice blue trail to them, so I want to keep that.	O
Um, let's see.	O
I think I have a fix.	O
'cause this is an additional effect that goes over.	O
One thing I'm going to have to do is turn off the drumsticks though.	O
Or Alternatively.	O

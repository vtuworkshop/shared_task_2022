At least I can find out.	O
Alright, so.	O
Don't wanna change the timing.	O
Now that seemed to fix it.	O
But the good news is it's underneath everything.	O
I'm just going to stretch that out.	O
OK.	O
The only trick is we have the issue of those colors swipes, but that's as easy as readjusting the layers.	O
As long as I can find them and.	O
Play some accordingly.	O
OK prism prism.	O
What is emerging here?	O
I wonder if I can.	O
Turn off the other film instances, the initial.	O
Drum sequences So the only one appearing is.	O
The ones that were pre composed.	O
That way it's consistent.	O
We have the effects we want.	O
Now it's great, actually looks way better than what I was expecting.	O
Alright, let me take one quick look at this.	O
Yes, that feels much better now.	O
I think that the actual burst itself could be a lot brighter now.	O
I tend to keep things level in case it over processes with the footage, but in this case I think it needs to actually go out further perhaps.	O
Although I'm not sure I do like the balance of it, I can at least play with it and see what I can find, but I do like the direction that it's moving in.	O
'cause he had to sort of diminish it here.	O
Oh, uh, Gabriel Rodriguez, thank you for following me.	O
I wondered if, uh, duplicating the Alpha burst would.	O
Take more of an impact.	O
I like it.	O
I think there needs to be more space between those bars that come in though.	O
So I'm going to go through and see what I can do with the drum beats.	O
And if I don't like it, I can always put it back.	O
That's the beauty of something like this.	O
Oh, I kinda like that follow through.	O
Let me see that again.	O
Hold on a minute.	O
I don't know.	O
Maybe brought in just a little bit more, but I do like it.	O
You can see the spaces in between now.	O
Let me take a look.	O
Because I did love the initial movement, so I don't want to necessarily take that out of the equation.	O
You know what?	O
If they are just a little bit thinner.	O
Perhaps?	O
Well, not that then.	O
No.	O
Now it looks a little more level.	O
Let me look at it.	O

I like that.	O
You can see the spaces, but it has that same movement.	O
It's a nice pattern that emerges.	O
Yeah, let's go with it.	O
I think that the initial impact could last a little longer before it separates.	O
So I'm going to go back and adjust that.	O
OK, so it goes out there.	O
So what we can do is that can be brought in.	O
More like this.	O
Oh so, uh.	O
Gabriel Rodriguez writes hours getting cool.	O
Well, thank you and thank you for tuning in.	O
Alright, so.	O
I think a little bit more.	O
And go straight to the animation here.	O
I'm going to bring that in.	O
Yes, his any three really see the impact point on the symbol.	O
Of that animation bursting forth.	O
'cause otherwise, if you don't vary the speed, it's just going to look like lines or emerging, and there's no variation, no sense of impact.	O
So that's what I was looking for.	O
All right?	O
I'm looking at it in conjunction with the prismatic swipes that come in.	O
I'm thinking.	O
Does that look balanced or does one need to diminish for the other or vice versa?	O
But if I do, what do I keep most vibrant?	O
do I keep the swipes most vibrant or do I just keep both vibrant?	O
I mean, it plays well with the animation of them bursting forth and put the chromatic aberration in the footage, and it's got a nice overall theme going.	O
I'm just I'm taking a look.	O
I'm taking it all in, looking at the revisions made an wondering.	O
How can it be pushed further?	O
Well, for one, the Blues could be matched, so why don't we start there?	O
I think I have an easy way to go about doing that, 'cause I already know what I did too.	O
The drum trails.	O
If I go here.	O
If I go to any of the prism effects.	O
Well, this will be easy.	O
Now, where is that blue?	O
Here's the blue, uhm?	O
I'm going to make that a white.	O
I don't know if it's going to Register here, but we'll see.	O
It might mess with the RGB, I'm not sure.	O
But if it does then I'll find a different way.	O
Oh, looks like it didn't.	O
I want to see it in action though.	O
Now I might be able to do some overall adjustments over top of this to really match those Blues.	O

Let me know what you're studying Anile Best.	O
I'll give you a better a more detailed answer based on that.	O
So.	O
But I'm glad you're interested in learning the process.	O
That's wonderful.	O
Alright, so.	O
I didn't want to diminish the texture behind him, but I certainly wanted to.	O
Bring him out.	O
And diminish the backdrop.	O
Oh mainly web and social media.	O
OK well.	O
The first of all, you can easily work with social.	O
You can make social media, graphics and promo materials easily with the Adobe suite UM in between the design programs and the filmmaking programs and motion graphics, which is what I'm working in now.	O
I tend to use all of those for any of the projects I'm working on.	O
It's not limited, so I would recommend.	O
Specifically, if you're going to look it up.	O
I believe it's turned into.	O
There was a website.	O
It used to be called Linda Common.	O
They had really.	O
They had wonderful courses on how to go about using certain programs that do's and don'ts.	O
The right way to go about preparing a project you know and what you want to avoid.	O
and I believe it's turned into LinkedIn learning, but I know that there are other tutorials out there that you can look up about.	O
Learning the interface.	O
Learning how to use it for certain things like social media, 'cause there are different setups for different processes.	O
What a filmmaker would use for their project setup might be vastly different than what somebody would use for social media, so I would start based on that and just look up any videos based on somebody that's worked in the industry that works in social media.	O
Or better yet, if you are able to network with somebody that is working in.	O
In an area that you're interested in.	O
You know, see if they have time to answer a couple of questions about what the process is like.	O
Any guidance they can give you know things like that and any resources that they can.	O
Um direct you towards.	O
I hope that that answers your question.	O
A little bit more.	O
Thoroughly than what I said before, but that's my.	O
That's the best advice that I can give to you and I do wish you the best of luck.	O
That's a wonderful field to go into.	O
There's a lot of opportunities there.	O
So good luck to you.	O
Oh Alright, so I think.	O
Yes.	O
I felt like that backdrop needed to be diminished in order to bring him out an right now it feels way more balance than it did previously because your eye ends up going to the back wall before I made the adjustment, the back wall was just as bright as Anthony and the problem is your ions of going to the brightest parts of.	O
Of the scene, and in this case it was taking away from him.	O
And becoming more important than the person the focus was on.	O
So in that case I ended up compositing it and bringing the brightness down so it matched the curtains behind, but it maintains the texture so it keeps its natural appearance.	O
I do notice one thing I want to fix, it's a small thing, but I am going to.	O
I do like this adjustment.	O
I'm happy with how this is looking.	O
I'm glad I went back to revise this one because now he's brought out of the scene.	O
He's not diminished by anything.	O
And the drum kit is also activated, which is a wonderful adjustment.	O
To include, it activates the scene basically.	O
Oh well, he's just followed up and said thank you very much.	O
Very useful though.	O
I'm glad you feel that way.	O
I'm glad and feel free to ask me any questions if you're just starting out in a field you know I might be able to point you towards some resources that might better assist you.	O
So you know.	O
You're gonna be alright.	O
Alright, so I saw one thing.	O

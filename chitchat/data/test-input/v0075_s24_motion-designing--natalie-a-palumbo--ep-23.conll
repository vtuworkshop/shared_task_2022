It's just little fair see that.	O
The backdrop of the later part of the backdrop is peaking through his arm, so I'm going to Adam ask for that, but.	O
Just a little bitty mask.	O
It's like a blink and you'll miss it kind of thing, but.	O
Sometimes the process of masking can take much longer than anticipated.	O
But that really depends on the complexity of what you're masking out too.	O
Like let's say this, uh.	O
Let's say I was just starting out and I was trying to mask out a hand and it was moving really fast.	O
You have to have masks for each individual joint probably.	O
You know, let alone finger.	O
So it can get pretty complex and you have to allow for that time, especially if you're going to show compositing affects this way using track Maps.	O
I don't mind I.	O
I love the process.	O
You know I could do this all day.	O
But I like to sell something at the end for you guys to see.	O
Now what's going on here?	O
Oh, that's his hand.	O
We don't want to.	O
We do not want to put exposure on his hand.	O
Well, a darkened exposure anyway.	O
Oh, I see one frame.	O
Another blink and you'll miss it, but it's good to catch them.	O
Just as long as I don't mess with his hand.	O
OK.	O
I think I think I fixed it.	O
I want to make sure.	O
I'm going to check my work.	O
Nice, OK, so that gap that I was talking about now matches the backdrop behind him, so it's consistent.	O
It's fluid.	O
He's represented.	O
Well, he's the emphasis of the scene.	O
And.	O
I'm so glad I went back to this one because I thought it could be polished much further.	O
I did love the effect but I felt like there was something missing and that was it because it reads completely differently now.	O
'cause he's the focal point.	O
Which is really nice.	O
OK, now I think that this one is good to go and with that I think I'm going to go ahead and let you guys know about my next broadcasting date.	O
Let me just pull up my calendar.	O
OK, here it is.	O
And.	O
So my next life streaming date is going to be on the 9th starting at 9:00 PM eastern Standard Time, 6:00 PM Pacific Time.	O
If you wrote in the chat at all tonight, thank you so much.	O
If you follow during the broadcast.	O
Thank you, um, if you ask thoughtful questions.	O
Thank you so much.	O
And um, special thanks to the black ties for allowing me to show my creative process.	O
You guys are amazing to work with.	O
If any of you are interested in 50, sixty 70s classic rock, I would definitely take a look at their Facebook page.	O
You'll see a lot of my film based promos there, and some of the other social media stuff that I've done for them.	O

Hey guys.	O
How is everyone?	O
Hope you guys can see me, can you hear me well?	O
So the mic is working well.	O
Nice to see you guys after um one week right?	O
So on holiday with my family so that's the reason why I couldn't go live last week and I'm grateful to see you guys again this week.	O
And yeah, super super excited to show you guys what I have for today.	O
So I was just thinking, right?	O
Uhm, I think it would be nice to have, like different variations of photo manipulations, right?	O
If you look back at my previous streams, I've done like science fiction like out experience.	O
I've done like on the land or efficiency are higher now.	O
We agree fication yes.	O
I had amazing weekend allocation so yeah, thanks for joining once again.	O
So yeah, I was just saying that I think it would be nice to have like a different types of like a photo manipulation.	O
And for today, I think it would be nice to try out something different like we tried the land type of photo manipulation that was done on the land side and we also have done the outer space an this time around.	O
I think it would be nice to just.	O
Create something underwater, right?	O
As you can see from the title itself, it says treasure.	O
So what is this treasure about what's happening?	O
What are the props like?	O
What is the scene?	O
Looks like an stuff like that.	O
You get to see it in a few minutes.	O
So without further ado, let's get started.	O
Right now, let me just switch to Photoshop 123.	O
OK, perfect as you can see I am using the wider panel once again right?	O
I used to use square type but for this time around I only show more stuff and I think a wider panel or converse works better.	O
Let's see.	O
So everybody who's online hello hi, so we're going to start our manipulation.	O
By creating the composition, of course it's very important to just do all the composition.	O
The rough winds just place all the images and and then you work on the colour balance carried out and stuff like that.	O
OK, so let's get started.	O
So of course first thing first, it was always start with the background and then.	O
Come to the foreground.	O
So for this I have.	O
This image.	O
So is the image of a C.	O
Right underneath the ocean.	O
So I am going to use.	O
This image as a background so I have a couple of ideas in mind.	O
An in this manipulation you get to see what is it about.	O
And I have the character.	O
A diver.	O
So let's just zoom in and see they go right and I'm going to position it.	O
Here.	O
Let me just lower down the oppositely, so the icon and know where I want him to be.	O
That works for now.	O
I'm fine with that one and.	O
I think it would be nice to have a bunch of fishes.	O
Right, I can just switch this image here.	O
And all this position it there.	O
Cool, how's everybody?	O
Next, I am going to, um, bringing more props I have with me.	O
This one of my favorite creature underwater, creature, jellyfish, and just so so beautiful.	O
Of course they're dangerous too.	O
Out place down here.	O
So imagine having a huge.	O
Jellyfish around you, but what is it about?	O
You get to know very soon and I would like to duplicate that.	O
Siri go hi, I said good thanks for joining.	O
From Sweden.	O
And I would like to come.	O
Enlarge this Bit more.	O
His position in there, as you can see I am reusing assets, right?	O
For example, you can see the jellyfish.	O
So there are some fast you can see, So what you can do is you can always duplicate it and move it around so that people wouldn't know that it's actually a same as exame stock photo.	O
Perfect on next.	O
I am going to bring in some bubbles.	O
OK, so for this bubble I am going to just reduce the size and position it here for now.	O

And I also have.	O
Another bubble.	O
Which I'm going to just put this in it over here.	O
OK, that's kind of like my composition, right?	O
So I have the guy, so as you can see from the title, you say treasure.	O
So what this is treasure about.	O
Well, I actually have the second main character.	O
I'll position it right above the sea layer.	O
This this.	O
So octopus is the creature underwater, but what do I mean by?	O
Treasure you'll know later on of the eyes that anything right.	O
So for now.	O
Let's just lower down the opposite E&C decomposition.	O
Always load on your positive so that you know where the things are before you start cutting it and stuff like that.	O
It's always good to know.	O
How it's gonna look like, right?	O
For that's perfect and I'm going to just reduce the opposite of this.	O
OK, and the Fishers I am going to also reduce the Opacity.	O
Perfect and I'm going to just.	O
Bringing the octopus.	O
I'm going to switch to horizontal.	O
Reason is because there's like a cut short cut off line here.	O
I think it would be nice to just flip it.	O
OK, I'm going to flip it and I'm going to enlarge it slightly.	O
So the focus is more towards the face area and logic a bit more, not so much.	O
Lego that might work.	O
Perfect.	O
OK, let's.	O
Move the diver up perfect.	O
OK, now we can start editing stuff.	O
So first thing first I would like to start off with the dye verb.	O
Let's hide the rest of the stock images diver make it 100% zoom in.	O
Of course, the easier way to cut it came out from the background will be pressing on W as we all know from the previous streams.	O
Maybe select unselect subject.	O
Let's see what happens.	O
Perfectly is selected, but of course the tank is not selected.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to switch to L.	O
I'm going to.	O
Highlight.	O
Or select this.	O
Thank.	O
Great.	O
I'm going to select this.	O
OK, to be more over here.	O
Oops, I don't need that, but it's OK, I'll just adjust it later.	O
Perfect that's selected uhm?	O
An I am good.	O
I think or hold on 2nd this area I don't want it to get selected.	O
Perfect is an.	O
Need to be selected.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to press shift.	O
So what's happening now is that I'm trying to.	O
Select this diver from this image so that I can use it for my photo manipulation.	O
Prefer everything else looks OK and then you can go ahead and press on Muskie.	O
OK, so you can see what's the problem here, right?	O
So there's still a white outline around him, So what you can do is you can always go to select and Mars again.	O
And as you can see, only contrast level.	O
You can just increase it.	O
And there's also a feather that you can play with, right?	O
But for this I am not going to use that.	O
Or you can use the shift edge.	O
Can you see what happens here?	O
If I want more of these edges, I can even use this or I can reduce it.	O
It's similar we have.	O
I done the filter and the minimum and maximum.	O
Perfect, just click OK.	O
There you go.	O
There's a diver, and as you can see the color is off.	O
But let's not worry about that now.	O
Let's just do the blending mode first.	O
For example, there's a jellyfish.	O
Of course, with the black background I want in a 1D octopus to blend with the background.	O
So of course you switch to screen.	O
Switch the screen enlarger.	O
Change the angle like this.	O
OK, nice as you can see this.	O
So let's zoom in and see this right.	O
You can see there's like a line around it.	O
I am going to change that.	O
So what I'm going to do is I am going to remove it.	O
How press on CTRL L?	O
Once you press CTRL L you get this precept like this pop up its levels.	O
I want you to just drag this light and have a look at the line.	O

It will disappear.	O
Can you see that?	O
Right?	O
So I'm going to do that.	O
Click OK for now I'm just going to leave the jellyfish over there.	O
I'm not going to touch it.	O
I'm going to go to the second jellyfish image down here and I'm going to do the same.	O
I'm going to increase.	O
The opposite yanne change the blending mode normal to screen and you can see the same thing.	O
We still have this white line around it.	O
Press on CTRL L.	O
Move the slider.	O
And you get to see the Fish.	O
And of course, if you feel like.	O
Decreasing levels just making the image looks very contrast.	O
See what you can do is you can always recall musket, so you just need to press musket press on B for brush.	O
And you can just erase it like this.	O
Let's do that one more time.	O
Increase the flow.	O
Then I'm working on the ground.	O
Philly jellyfish is not working.	O
Reason is because.	O
I am not pressing the right thing.	O
OK, cool, so now I'm just press on the.	O
To get the color palette like annoyed as switched to be.	O
Prince super weird.	O
Control.	O
Uh-huh OK, what I'm going to do is I'm going to convert this quickly to small object.	O
And see what happens here.	O
Uh-huh, I know it's a problem.	O
Can you see up here?	O
The mood is.	O
Switch to screen.	O
I want you to change the normal.	O
There's a reason why I couldn't musket.	O
Ha ha.	O
Things happen perfect.	O
That works right?	O
So I have this composition such in money Hawaii.	O
Thanks for joining life.	O
I have eight people watching online.	O
Hello to everyone.	O
Next I'm going to work on the bubbles.	O
Increase the opposite E.	O
Let's change normal to screen and less in larger.	O
So of course, the reason why I'm placing the bubbles here is because.	O
The octopus is releasing it, right?	O
So we just leave it there and press on CTRL L.	O
I do that perfect.	O
I remove the background already is bit too much like as in it's too obvious.	O
I want to just reduce the opposite E.	O
OK, that works next.	O
I am going to bring in the fish.	O
OK, this is the fish I'm going to do the blending mode.	O
Let's make normal to uhm screen.	O
Colour Dutch works as well, but let's just fix with screen.	O
Make sure you opposite day is 100.	O
Right, and I want you to do a bit of masking for this.	O
Musket and then change your brush to something big.	O
And just do.	O
A bit of brushing.	O
Let's lower on the opposite.	O
He not so intense.	O
OK.	O
It's perfect.	O
I don't need this big fish are so I am going to.	O
Erase them.	O
It's OK if it behaves like a soft spot.	O
Around the fish.	O
OK, we'll just do like this.	O
OK, perfect.	O
She's listening.	O
What's the difference between the blending mode in the layer and then the one you just changed just now?	O
And I'm so.	O
OK, so for the screen here, right when I press on this brushes life example when I switch to here and you can see up here there's normal so I'm doing too.	O
I'm changing the function of the brush on the converse.	O
So it's for the brush.	O
So for the normal it can be for the picture, so that's a different.	O
Right, it's not the same thing.	O
Like for example, I can change doctrine or whatever it will work on the brushes.	O
Layer is usually for the blending mode of that particular layer onto the background.	O
I verify answer you right, but that's how it works.	O
OK, going to change.	O
So what I'm going to do next is I am going to slowly what he called do the adjustments.	O
For example.	O
So I have a few things in mind I want to.	O

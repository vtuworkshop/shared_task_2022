So rather than have a traditional way of him breathing, and I thought it would be nice to have, like a very classic looking glass like around glass around him so that it looks a bit of like like more modern type of like a diver.	O
I'm not so traditional so I'm going to do that and I'm going to also change color right after I fix the color lighting for him.	O
So going to press on diver, there you go and I'm going to.	O
Just.	O
Go down here adjustment lay I'll I'm going to choose on color balance.	O
So as you can see, right?	O
Uhm.	O
Cute picture you press on the masking underneath.	O
OK.	O
So the Hue and saturation of the whole image is not actually The thing is, right?	O
I am looking at my life stream.	O
The color is not really the same so I will make this work.	O
And I'm going to change the color balance of this diagram.	O
They go, I'm going to increase the scion.	O
OK.	O
I going to desaturate him also, so let's go down there and.	O
Make him slightly darker.	O
OK, let's desaturate him.	O
Meaning not so colorful.	O
For free Phillips OK, next I am going to fix few things.	O
Life example, the lighting right like I said in my previous streams it's very important to know where your life comes from.	O
How do you adjust it accordingly?	O
I think a bunch of you guys asked me to ask.	O
Same question like how do you manage the lighting?	O
Always find out from the aura image for example in this image you know the sun Ray, right?	O
That hits the ocean and the sea is coming from the top.	O
So we need to adjust the.	O
Dive accordingly, so I'm going to Alice.	O
Just group him very quickly like this.	O
Let's call him.	O
Diver and in here I'm going to create a new layer on top of him, let's call it.	O
Shadow So let's zoom in, change your brush to something.	O
Small.	O
OK, I'm going to choose a black color.	O
Another color and I'm going to just reduce my flow.	O
And I'm going to do a manual painting.	O
Right, so when I do this, I'm actually painting just and then it came right.	O
Left example, not the top pipe, but the lower part.	O
Just a bit.	O
Because we all know the light is coming from the top path, right?	O
So I'm going to.	O
Just make everything underneath slightly darker and you go like this.	O
Perfect.	O
The water tank.	O
Oxygen tank, sorry.	O
Here perfect.	O
Around his face.	O
His arm.	O
Perfect OK.	O
They go.	O
It works.	O
OK.	O
Next over here.	O
OK.	O
It works.	O
So now if if you see right, I've adjusted the shadow this way so that when you fix, likely in such way or the shadow surgery you.	O
The image is more 3D ish for example.	O
Let me just show in the layer of the shader.	O
Just look at it.	O
Can you see the difference?	O
Yeah, so it's very, very important to do that.	O
Right in order to fix the lighting, you need to make sure that you fix the shadow.	O
Again, photo manipulation is all about that.	O
Once you fix the light and shadow, your photo manipulation will look good.	O
So before we move on, I think it would be nice to quickly apply can look up now itself rather than the at the end, so that I know how the colors look like.	O
So just go down here, look for color, look up.	O
And let's see if it works.	O
Um?	O
I really like this color, so I'm going to reduce the oppositely slightly.	O
Right, so they doesn't look so blue ish.	O
It doesn't give me the fantasy kind of till color always works or we call it.	O
In this case I'm using the tension green, so there's also other colors that you can use, like horror blue.	O
So horrible I think it's more intense.	O
The color this also from stock.	O
Fall colors.	O
Edgy Amber, it's one of my favorite, but I'm not going to use it for this one right?	O
And I'm going to quickly go back and stick with the.	O

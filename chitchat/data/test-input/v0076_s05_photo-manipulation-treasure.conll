Tension green like I really like this.	O
Right, let's do this.	O
Perfect and I have.	O
Jellyfish over here.	O
Next, we're going to go in and fix few things, like for example.	O
Like I say earlier, I'm going to remove.	O
Um?	O
The traditional way of sucking the oxygen and stuff like that.	O
I'm going to switch that so in order to do that, I'm going to zoom in.	O
I need to do a little bit of masking, so let's go to the divert an let's change the before brush.	O
I will change to my favorite browser just the tool oil base because I like the sharp edges on this brush and I'm going to remove this.	O
Very quickly the thing that has let's sticking in this mode.	O
OK, I'm going to do that.	O
Don't worry, he can still breathe because I have a solution for that.	O
OK.	O
So what I'm going to do is I am going to right above the layer mask I'm going to draw like a what you call like a shield to protect his neck before applying the.	O
What do you call the glass that I said earlier, right?	O
Like a ground glass?	O
So let's do this.	O
So for that I am going to quickly.	O
Create some sort of like a shape.	O
Thank you as you can see, right?	O
I'm using the Polygonal Lasso.	O
To create a ship.	O
So I need this.	O
They go perfect and I'm going to change to bucket.	O
And apply the color.	O
Cool so I have like a black base there.	O
The color doesn't match with the contrast of the image.	O
You don't have to worry where you get quickly.	O
Do is.	O
You can always go to color overlay.	O
Here what you can do is you can color pic from the image.	O
Ann What he can do is.	O
You can increase the as you can see here, right?	O
I'm increasing the opposite E.	O
Lego.	O
Right, I will now duplicate it, 'cause I think we need to have it like a slightly thicker.	O
That works I have.	O
Let's call this shield.	O
Chill and I'm going to adjust few things.	O
I'm going to.	O
Brush a bit more there.	O
OK, that's perfect and I'm going to put on the shield and how to create the shield manual way so I'm not going to bring in any of these packages.	O
What I'm going to do is I want to zoom in.	O
I'm going to choose the elliptical marquee tool.	O
Right, and I'm going to press on my shift.	O
See what happens.	O
I will get a perfect.	O
Um?	O
Elliptical and I'm going to.	O
That's not the right size.	O
I'm going to sleep.	O
I'm going to make it a little bigger.	O
Yeah, around there, right?	O
So with this what I'm going to do is I'm going to shade it.	O
You can always press on it and move things around if you want to.	O
So for this I'm going to place it right over.	O
There.	O
Yeah, that's perfect and I'm going to color it.	O
Let's call this glass.	O
OK, let's switch your brush.	O
Do something soft.	O
OK, color to white.	O
Reduce the flow.	O
Because I don't want it to be too not too, I don't need to be too intense.	O
And now what you do is you just color it.	O
Um, more like yeah brush it.	O
So when you do that, you will actually get.	O
A perfect elliptical glass.	O
We will do more adjustments to it in a bit.	O
Let me just show you let me just press CTRL this so that you can see can you see that there's like like a glass around it?	O
Perfect and I'm going to zoom in.	O
Um, an apply motioning.	O
As you can see, the light is coming from the top pipe, right?	O
So I'm going to apply.	O
Here.	O
More intense white color around here.	O
OK.	O
Around there you add more shavings onto the class, and we're going to reduce the amount here.	O
So let's change to E, which is the eraser, and let's choose a soft brush, sorry.	O
Um solve brush legal and reduce the amount here.	O
OK cool, let's see how it looks like.	O

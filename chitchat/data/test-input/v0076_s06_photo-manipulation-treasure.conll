Can you see that this is done manually?	O
Bright light comes from the top and you can always change the way you call them.	O
The amount of our intensity.	O
What you can do is you can always replicate the glass.	O
Right the layer so that it's more intense.	O
That looks good.	O
Ann I think will be nice to actually have another layer on top and have that a bit of that.	O
I don't see like, uhm like Aglow, not blow.	O
That's not the right word.	O
Hum.	O
Like a light.	O
OK, I'm going to reduce the flow.	O
And I'm going to just.	O
And it here, right?	O
So there's more 3D issue.	O
Will do more adjustment to it in a bit.	O
Let's go in here and erase.	O
Or load on the opposite because I don't need to be too much.	O
OK, and I'm going to erase.	O
It a little.	O
OK, let's erase it.	O
This.	O
Let's move it around.	O
Right this.	O
And you can move movie here or there.	O
I think here is perfect.	O
Cool, right?	O
and I think it would be nice if you look at this.	O
All this science fiction movies where they actually at the glow.	O
Around the night so that they can see again.	O
I can do that or what can I can do is I can actually use his hand.	O
You can see he's like holding something so maybe I can do that right again, I don't know.	O
Let's just create the light first.	O
So here I'm going to do I call it shade and I'm going to add on the light right above the shield layer, let's call it light.	O
Oops.	O
OK.	O
OK for that also a menu away.	O
I want you to zoom in.	O
An increase the flow.	O
Make your brush really tiny.	O
Anne at lights.	O
Like this?	O
Around his neck.	O
And reduce of course.	O
The boat in Sharer they go, so that's.	O
This like light around his neck and I want to add a bit of blow or create a new layer called.	O
Glow.	O
Make my rush slightly bigger, but this time the flow I want you to reduce it because I'd only be too intense.	O
OK, so you can see how it's going right now, right?	O
It's a manual way.	O
Perfect, let's do here.	O
Here.	O
Sure.	O
Here.	O
Shoe.	O
OK, that works.	O
So that it doesn't look flat Lego that's blowing right now.	O
And of course, if you think actually if it's really real that he's having this LED lights around his neck, I think would be nice to reflect it on his face as well.	O
So I'm going down here to the divers layer.	O
Create a new layer called light.	O
For this I am going to change my normal mode blending mode to screen.	O
So that it's really bright light, so I'm going to go in, zoom in an I will just.	O
Increase my brush.	O
And I will.	O
Can you see that?	O
Now he's going around.	O
His neck was like a globe.	O
Perfect and I would like to.	O
I'd like to have the light reflected on his.	O
Outfit as well, so I'm going to just do that.	O
Um, reduce my flow, not so much.	O
Like this?	O
OK.	O
And a beat.	O
Here.	O
Ponies arm OK, that works.	O
Right, we just created a manual way.	O
Of having a shield.	O
Who are you guys enjoying the tutorial so far?	O
Cool um?	O
Next, hello to everybody who's watching online.	O
Seven of you guys?	O
How are you guys doing?	O
Next, I am going to.	O

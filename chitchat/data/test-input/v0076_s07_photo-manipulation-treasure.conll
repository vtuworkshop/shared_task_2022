Fix few things.	O
For example, as you can see, right?	O
The hand positioning of him.	O
Let's look at the original image.	O
Let me see if I can bring in the origin image.	O
Lego.	O
So as you can see on the original image.	O
Right, he's.	O
As if he's holding something, I'm not sure what, but we can utilize it in a way that he's holding actual light or something, so it's also a manual way of doing things.	O
So let's see if I can do that.	O
Next, I am going to create that that thing that is holding.	O
At first I thought it would be nice to have like a like a sphere, but I.	O
There's a reason behind it, but I think in this case our thing would be nice to have that light flashing.	O
Towards the flashing towards the octopus.	O
Assuming here.	O
Let's go back to the diverse alere.	O
Let's create a touch.	O
Again, it will be a manual way.	O
Again.	O
I need to imagine how to touch looks like.	O
So I think it would be nice to have like a handle.	O
So in this tutorial you play a lot of.	O
Like a drawing thing, like a minimum way of creating things.	O
I think we haven't done so much like this in our previous abstruse, so I'm going to create the handle.	O
Like this?	O
Right, and I'm going to just drop a color, which is of course the black for now.	O
Cool.	O
And I'm going to.	O
Change my brush to some eraser.	O
To a shot 1.	O
And I'm going to create the handle by doing this right?	O
CS holding the handle.	O
I'm going to erase that.	O
This part of the hand.	O
Says it is holding something.	O
OK, and I'm going to do a manual way of.	O
Creating the butcher.	O
The big touch.	O
So I'm going to do this.	O
I'm going to do that.	O
Like this again, I'm just imagining I don't know how they thought she was like, right?	O
So we're going to do that menu fixing.	O
OK.	O
Something like this?	O
Perfect, let's sharpen the lines.	O
So I'm using for Nicola Lasso to shut the.	O
The parts that I don't want.	O
Right, so that it looks more legit.	O
Lego is holding that light I think would be nice to have a bit of shading, so let's create a new masking on top of the touch call.	O
Um shading Change to brush.	O
And I'm going to change your something soft.	O
They go.	O
And I'm going to just apply a bit of light.	O
Not sure if you guys can see.	O
So there you go.	O
Something like this?	O
So there's a bit of like a dent.	O
OK, next I'm going to create the light.	O
Right?	O
Let's create knew layer, let's call it.	O
Light again, I'm so let's on back the octopus.	O
OK, so it has to.	O
The thing is it has to light up this area.	O
There's a reason behind it so I am going to.	O
Blend the octopus before I fix the light so I know exactly where the light is going to be.	O
OK, we have few I kind of like color Dodge.	O
OK, why don't we go right now is I'm trying to blend the octopus.	O
With the background.	O
Some finding the right blending mode that works.	O
Again, I can choose the screen.	O
The problem here is that the color doesn't look right because the octopus picture texture is really unique.	O
I really like the UM.	O
Hello Dutch, I'm going to just leave it there and will fix few lightings very soon, but for now I am going to.	O
Fix the edges of the press, press on CTRL L.	O
Reduce.	O
The line they go.	O
Going.	O
OK, perfect now what are you going to do is?	O

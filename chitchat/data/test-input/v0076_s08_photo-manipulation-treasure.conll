Perfect actually.	O
The light can go up here so I am going to the light area.	O
Write a light layer tongue slip all the time today.	O
Not sure why, so now I am going to draw.	O
Where the light supposed to be, right?	O
A waste of life.	O
Something like this?	O
This area here.	O
OK, and I'm going to go back down here.	O
And press and it's like the old here.	O
And.	O
I am going to move the light right at the back of the touch.	O
OK.	O
Now it's time to create the shading, So what you can do is.	O
Um?	O
Aluminum away, you can put a gradient if you want to.	O
You can do normal brushing.	O
Let's try Witcher works right again.	O
I don't know.	O
I'm going to change the light to something slightly yellowish.	O
And I'm going to increase my brush to something big.	O
Uh, my flow is fine I think, and I'll just brush it like this.	O
Right up.	O
Networks control D dislike.	O
OK, as you can see the of course the light is not right, right?	O
For example is very short time to make.	O
A bit of adjustment to it.	O
What you can do is you can go to filter blur, Gaussian, blur.	O
So when you do that, you get this sort of like lighting.	O
And of course, it's not perfect yet.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to do a bit of tilting.	O
Adjustment distort the light.	O
2nd Press on going directly before I do that, let me just convert this to a small object.	O
OK, let's distort it.	O
For example, I'm going to do this.	O
Let's zoom in to see that.	O
So I'm gonna narrow the light more.	O
OK, that works.	O
Let's move the light.	O
There.	O
Azuma in see perfect.	O
Um?	O
What you can do is you can always add more shadings to it right?	O
For example, what I'm going to do now is that above the light I'll create a new layer in our musket.	O
And I'll call it a bright light.	O
Right, what I'm going to do is change to my brush.	O
And change to something little brighter than that.	O
Color is like that previously reduce.	O
The brush an I am going to.	O
Brush on top of the light.	O
Perfectly, everything looks OK.	O
Something is not right again.	O
This is cool.	O
Let me deselect.	O
Release this clip.	O
So what I'm going to do is.	O
I'm going to duplicate the light.	O
Right, they go and I'm going to change the color using the color overlay.	O
For something more right.	O
They go.	O
For some reason, color.	O
It's not changing.	O
I'm not sure why.	O
Let's try that one more time or just do a manual fixing.	O
Lego let me just create this.	O
Area.	O
Of Light.	O
Lego and what I'm going to do this time is.	O
I am going to do a bit of shading.	O
How's everybody doing?	O
And dropping the color with more intense color, they go.	O
That's what I want finally.	O
OK, slightly more brighter and of course you need to.	O
Change the equation blow.	O
That's called this bright light.	O
OK, and I need to do a bit of masking there.	O
So this is zoom in.	O
An cleanup.	O
This error.	O
So that is not so.	O

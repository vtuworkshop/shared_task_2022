Right now it's outside the touch so I'm going to do that.	O
Same with the light.	O
I'm going to brush.	O
Of a bit here and here.	O
OK, I'm going to make the other part of the area to be slightly darker so that.	O
Um, their focus is in the middle, right?	O
For example, the glue, the glue and everything is perfect, but.	O
We can always enlarge it.	O
As well as convoluted Smart Object Control T.	O
And let's use the walk tool to remove the light mode towards the.	O
This area here.	O
They go like that and we can always use the tool.	O
To enlarge it.	O
Let's light control T move the light down.	O
Perfect.	O
Thanks for the light.	O
OK.	O
Well, it's a bit.	O
Upwards.	O
OK, perfect.	O
This is what I wanted.	O
OK, and this year this area here of the first.	O
So what happened mine is that I think would be nice to have like A.	O
So what happened is that this guy is a diver.	O
He supposed to dive in with his friend.	O
His friend couldn't make it so.	O
He was just exploring and he found his huge octopus.	O
But The thing is, this part of the area here.	O
It's actually in gold color.	O
So this is actually a good part of the octopus, and he's just wondering if we can get something out of it and stuff like that.	O
That's why the name of the first of inflation is called treasure.	O
So I want to color it but let me see if I fix the lighting.	O
OK, I'm going to reduce the amount of the opposite E.	O
Things to write.	O
OK.	O
And I'm also going to adjust the color look up.	O
Two more intense till.	O
Green, OK, there you go, that works.	O
Um, I'm going to do some modification for the October's, So what I'm going to do is.	O
Masking first, let's go to the octopus and I need to color.	O
Let's calorie.	O
Above, here's this layer.	O
I'm going to Cal, call it go reasons because I'm going to color this part of this area in goal.	O
So let's change to brush.	O
How's everybody doing?	O
Are you guys good?	O
Goal again, I don't know which color works this go my work OK, I change to normal to color.	O
So they go.	O
That's the goal that I'm looking for.	O
So I'm going to brush this area here.	O
So that is gold.	O
So How do I did that?	O
I change the blending mode color here, normal 2 color so when you do that, whichever color that you selected will blend on top of the subject.	O
Right, so I'm going to do this.	O
Perfect and I'm going to erase.	O
Few areas of the.	O
Go 'cause it blends so much to the other side.	O
OK, that works.	O
So I'm just erasing the edges.	O
All.	O
The octopus, they go right?	O
And if you find the color is a bit too intense oh, and also the reason why I place the goal right above the color look up so that I do want it to merge with the color.	O
For example if I bring it down.	O
Something just off with the color blending, so I'm going to position it up and I'm going to change according to my preference, so I'm going to choose.	O
Now I could click convert it small object 1st and I'll just use color balance.	O
To adjust.	O
The goal.	O
They go.	O
This.	O
To be yellowish.	O
Very strong colour, OK and reduce the opposite.	O
If you file find it too intense.	O
Perfect that works.	O
An as you all know.	O

Because octopuses really in this case it's really huge.	O
So what I'm going to do is I am going to mask the list leaks out and bring in more legs of the verticals denticles.	O
Is that right?	O
OK, let's go to the octopus.	O
Let's close the diverse layer.	O
Of the 1st, I'm going to do masking less.	O
Person masking changed your brush to something big.	O
And let's erase this part of the octopus.	O
How you guys doing?	O
OK cool, I am going to bring in the lakes.	O
So let me see they go let's my.	O
Files.	O
Let's look for the Lake.	O
OK, I found it.	O
I'm going to bring it in here.	O
There you go.	O
It's really huge.	O
I'm going to press on W and press unselect subject.	O
Just to select all the white errors.	O
This still a bit more here I'm going to.	O
Let's see how it looks like.	O
No, not right.	O
I also want to select this area here so.	O
OK, this select this area.	O
It looks OK.	O
Let's try masking it.	O
OK cool, I'm finding it.	O
So now I am going to.	O
Do some compositions.	O
How's everybody doing?	O
OK and larger.	O
At one year, of course, we will change the color balance and stuff like that, and it's a bit of white paint around it, so I am going to go to the filter.	O
Other and press on minimum.	O
So when when I do that it removes all the white areas white lines?	O
And I am going to change the colors of this denticles.	O
So and also want to create more of like a depth of field.	O
So yeah, those people watching online high.	O
If you find this video useful, give me a thumbs up.	O
Let's go ahead and change the colors of the testicles.	O
Press on control B.	O
For the.	O
Color balance.	O
Adjustment.	O
Legal.	O
I'm going to change according to the colors of the atmosphere.	O
OK, more of the science.	O
A bit of green.	O
OK, now I'm going to duplicate the layer.	O
I'm going to do a blending mode where I want to darken it.	O
Like this and reduce it slightly like this.	O
And Uhm, I have something in my OK.	O
Let's control G group it.	O
Let's call this.	O
What he calls got tentacles.	O
OK.	O
And I'm going to create more of decomposition.	O
So what I'm going to do is I am going to duplicate it.	O
And I'm going to make it off horizontal so that I can reuse this assets.	O
For example, what I'm going to do is I will place it.	O
One over here.	O
And make it vertical as well so that it doesn't look so repetitive.	O
They go as if it's like.	O
By the above and down part of the area and stuff like that.	O
And I am going to also.	O
Change something on this.	O
For example, here I'm going to group it all together and I want to create this depth of field.	O
In order to do that, I'll just blow it up.	O
Gaussian blur.	O
Right, you can see like as if it's like it's so huge that the focus is.	O
What was the diver and the octopus?	O
Not so much of the Lake, right?	O
And I'm going to come.	O
Oh yeah, I better save it first.	O
Treasure perfect.	O
Let's uhm enlarge it a bit more.	O
Like this?	O
OK, I need to do a bit of color balance.	O
I can always go down here and choose color overlay.	O
Reduce the color.	O

Like this?	O
But of course I color pick from.	O
Here.	O
So in this live stream, we're learning something new.	O
Right?	O
OK.	O
As in We are trying to use more of the color overlay.	O
Last time, if you remember, I create a new layer and drop a color.	O
So yeah, there's always at many ways of creating stuff.	O
So I'm happy with.	O
This.	O
OK.	O
Um, let's remove the one on top and just use this one by duplicating.	O
And.	O
I'm going to move this down.	O
Like this?	O
Enlarge it hello to those of you watching online.	O
How's everybody doing?	O
That's repeating, let's try it this way.	O
Looks good, OK cool.	O
Let's also play with some light above this denticles.	O
I want you to create a new layer called light.	O
But this one make sure you must get.	O
Change your brush something huge.	O
Color pick from.	O
This image itself and I want you to just color the top part of the authentic rals because obviously the light is coming from top right.	O
So this is what I'm doing right now.	O
I'm going to just color.	O
At the areas.	O
Where the light might hit.	O
OK, I'm also going to create a new player called shading.	O
And I'm going to change to something duck.	O
And I'm going to brush here.	O
The reason why I'm doing this is because.	O
So that the focus is more towards the octopus.	O
But still you play with.	O
This.	O
Cool.	O
With the lighting.	O
So yeah, like I said before, right?	O
It's very important to play with light and shadow because.	O
That what makes the whole.	O
Manipulation looks real.	O
So this fish is bothering me.	O
I am going to switch the area.	O
Fish is you have to go this side 'cause I think you're disturbing the focus of the octopus so I can bring in the Fisher, but I move it at the back of everything.	O
Like that?	O
And I'm going to enlarge it.	O
As if the fish is all like oh what does diverge doing?	O
OK.	O
Perfect.	O
And I'm going to blur out this.	O
Jellyfish So what I'm going to do is I am going to use the.	O
Version do they go?	O
Implicit.	O
And a site.	O
Maybe here?	O
Cool.	O
I will utilize one more of this.	O
Actually I do have another jellyfish.	O
Let me see if I can bring it in.	O
I have one more one more OK I have.	O
Yes I have one.	O
Perfect.	O
This.	O
So I'm going to change the screen.	O
And I'm going to place it somewhere.	O
Sure.	O
And I don't know where to put.	O
I can put down here by 1 two.	O
Any suggestions?	O
Those people watching online?	O
Any questions so far?	O
OK, going to reduce the size to settings too big.	O
Let's put it at the back of the denticles.	O
OK, let's change.	O
The lighting of this.	O
Flip it vertical OK.	O
Press on L.	O
Control L to remove the.	O
White vertical lines.	O
Perfect.	O
I'm going to do some masking onto the jellyfish.	O
They go.	O

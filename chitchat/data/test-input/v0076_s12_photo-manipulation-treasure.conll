So I don't need this.	O
I don't need this jellyfish.	O
OK, the bottom one works, even this works.	O
OK, I'm going to just.	O
But it sure OK cool.	O
And rotate it slightly.	O
OK.	O
It's perfect.	O
Well, OK.	O
Everything looking good so far.	O
I'm going to make the tentacles a little bit more darker.	O
And how I'm going to do is that I'm going to go down here and press on Saturn.	O
So when you do that, see what happens?	O
Can you see this area here?	O
Let me just show in height.	O
Can you see?	O
Right, so I'm going to apply that a bit.	O
And I'm going to enlarge.	O
Sent equals I feel like it can be large.	O
And I place it.	O
Let's see if that works, and of course the light in shading's have to be in large as well, so I'm going to enlarge them and place it.	O
There.	O
Cool, now everything looks.	O
As like 1 picture.	O
I'm going to change the octopus colors because something is not right 'cause you can see that here the tint is here is different, so let's see if I can fix it by pressing on control B.	O
And.	O
I'm going to increase the sin.	O
And increase the magenta.	O
What was the green?	O
This without it you can see it in the difference.	O
Yeah no, it's more like a.	O
Mine looks better.	O
Perfect and hear what you can do is you can always create a new layer.	O
Let's call this shading what I'm going to do this here is that.	O
I'm going to color it.	O
Let's change my version something big.	O
Hum.	O
I'm going to, yeah, and I'm going to change the blending too soft light.	O
So I'm going to just brush.	O
This area slightly darker so that the focus, like I said previously, right?	O
So the focus more towards the octopus.	O
So by clicking all the shadings then.	O
The focus is there.	O
If I don't have all these lighting show in height.	O
Everything looks like a one flat piece.	O
This fish I can reduce the light a bit more.	O
How's everybody doing?	O
Is the check working how you guys?	O
Everybody seems very quiet.	O
Is it because you guys enjoying my life stream?	O
Hopefully.	O
Hello Sergio, Hello Shushan.	O
Hi, such meaning.	O
I'm going to increase the fish.	O
With more.	O
Legal and I'm going to reduce the opposite of the fish.	O
They go.	O
Perfect and let's get the.	O
Lego I'm going to move the bubbles.	O
She like this perfect.	O
I have another bubble.	O
Where is it voice here?	O
Perfect I'm going to place this somewhere.	O
Here.	O
But I'm going to drag it at the back of the tentacles.	O
They go and I have to do some blending.	O
Let's change normal oppositely to screen.	O
And let's just control press control L4.	O
Levels move the slider here.	O
Musket changed to B and remove.	O
This part of the.	O
She shouldn't say I really loves attention green this yeah me too.	O
You know I didn't plan like for example.	O
I kind of do a research last night, but this color was not there in my mind.	O
Not the tension.	O
Green works perfectly.	O
It gives this sophisticated look, I think.	O
And I would like to blur the bubbles.	O
So that's not so sure.	O
Yes, that works, or maybe not too much.	O

So yeah, it's called color.	O
Look up in order to get this or all you have to do is you go down here to the adjustment layer, look for color, look up and up.	O
Here you can choose the different settings.	O
Right, for example, there's attention green and stuff like that are no, no, the whole direction know the whole light, like the direction of the light of the whole image.	O
Uh, I don't know if I'm getting.	O
Your question are you talking about this light?	O
Oh, even the light year down here I have to manage manually created it.	O
For example, I need to create all the shadings.	O
Like for example, can you see the octopus layer?	O
Can you see that?	O
So that the focus more towards the middle part of the.	O
Manipulation.	O
The guys saying hi from Peru.	O
Hi Hello from Malaysia.	O
Like the direction of the light of the whole image is the Sun Ray.	O
Is something that I get from the image itself?	O
Example you can see.	O
This.	O
Right, the background image is actually one.	O
Let me show you so.	O
Yeah, so let me see if I can quickly show you.	O
So that if you're talking about the light, the light is already there in the stock image.	O
I hope I got.	O
The question right so yeah.	O
We can actually create the life you want it all I see thank you.	O
So yes, it's already flipped is a photo manipulation.	O
So yeah, so all my streams is about photo manipulation.	O
Yeah, it's all manipulated.	O
Thanks for joining my stream.	O
So I have 20 people watching online.	O
Hello everybody so this is what we've been working on the whole day today an I would like to add more of the.	O
Yeah, exactly.	O

Yes, so if I press on alternate.	O
Clear you get to see everything like.	O
For example, if I click on this.	O
They go right.	O

Thanks to you, I think you said the same thing in the previous.	O
Is such a useful.	O
Thank you so much.	O
Cool an I am going to.	O
Play bit of the lighting.	O
For example, I think I'm not done with the octopus yet urged sure, I'm going to color pink in color here.	O
Change my brush.	O
And I'm going to color this area here.	O
I gotta change height.	O
This blue thing here so I can use this.	O
And reduce the upper city.	O
Is like a cheap way by it works.	O
Can you see that sometimes the blending mode doesn't really blend the color properly, but you don't have to worry.	O
You can always do the adjustment layer like this.	O
OK.	O
The.	O
She says they unearth.	O
Please keep doing under.	O
Please keep doing behinds.	O
Please keep on doing live streams, even if it's not in the hands.	O
So yes, I learn from the previous life.	O
Perfect.	O
Cool wow I'm I'm actually almost done.	O
This is crazy, but don't worry, I'm going to end in more stuff.	O
OK, um, let's see what else I can do.	O
In any suggestions, I think on at more of the lighting on top of the octopus.	O
Uh, here, let's call this lighting.	O
This is colour.	O
OK, let's groove octopus before we get confused, because there's so many different layers.	O
OK, let's call this octopus.	O
Uh, purpose perfect.	O
We have the fish.	O
OK, we have the jellyfish.	O
Perfect an.	O
Cool.	O
Let's see if I can at most.	O
What is this layer?	O
Four or something?	O
So let's just remove that an.	O

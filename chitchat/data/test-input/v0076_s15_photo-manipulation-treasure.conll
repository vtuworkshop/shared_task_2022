Let me see if I can look for an ornament.	O
In my library.	O
Of.	O
On demand.	O
Let me see if I can find it.	O
Up 'cause I think it would be nice to have like a texture onto this goal I'm looking for.	O
What he called like a pattern that I can use.	O
Let me see, let me see if I can find.	O
Up How are you guys doing?	O
Yeah, I I I am planning to goes live even if it's not on behind.	O
So again I don't know.	O
I really loved.	O
To go, but let's see OK.	O
Oh OK, I found one of my stock image that might work again.	O
I don't know.	O
Let's try.	O
So I'm going to place it here.	O
I don't know if this pattern will work.	O
Let's see I need this part of.	O
The image let's delete the rest.	O
Let's look at the goal.	O
This there.	O
Kill it.	O
Oops, I need to be a smart object first.	O
Always, always do that.	O
Let's call this pattern.	O
Can I don't know if it's going to, I'll just musket.	O
I don't know if you guys can see.	O
Oh no, it doesn't work so.	O
We will just use this kind of blending mode.	O
They go.	O
I don't know which one will work.	O
Oh, this is interesting.	O
OK.	O
So what I'm doing is I'm trying to blend.	O
This ornament OK, let's see if this works right again, I don't know.	O
I'm going to just switch this.	O
But this enlarge it slightly.	O
And I'm going to, of course, musket.	O
Reduce the opposite E.	O
Movie here.	O
And I am going to, um, musket shushan is saying can we go back and change the properties after converting to smart object?	O
Yes you can.	O
So in order to do that.	O
Uh, let me see which one is our.	O
But is it OK?	O
For example, if you look at this right, the tentacles in order to open back the properties?	O
What you do is you just double click on this icon.	O
And you will go back here.	O
Can you see that?	O
All your properties all still there.	O
Once you save.	O
Any edits done within this, just press CTRL S.	O
Save it and it will appear.	O
Yeah.	O
In this image got it.	O
Click on the small little icon.	O
Under lyrics of not this not this area.	O
Click on this monitor icons.	O
Or by uncertainty or question.	O
And I'm going to create.	O
Yeah, now I'm going to erase.	O
This right here.	O
OK, menu fixing.	O
I'm going to erase here.	O
OK, so that it doesn't look like so flat, so now he has a bit of texture.	O
I think it's nice to have this again.	O
I know if you guys watch all this treasure movies, usually you have this ancient looking.	O
Passing around it.	O
OK, she's done.	O
Got it perfect.	O
So what I'm doing is I'm trying.	O
I'm trying to create this shape around it and I think will be nice to just shop in it.	O
As well, so that it's more like in most legal perfect, let's do a bit more.	O
Yeah.	O
That works.	O
Can you guys see that right?	O
So by doing this?	O
Then there's the ship around it.	O
And I think would be nice too also.	O
Here is it a bit more.	O
Over here.	O
Those people watching online hello hi.	O
OK, now we have to ship, right?	O

Wow is that any more elements that you guys want me to add?	O
OK, I need to do a bit of masking.	O
This area doesn't make sense.	O
Kendall and brush this off.	O
OK, cool, OK.	O
You know what I need to do?	O
A bit of shading onto the goal.	O
I'm not happy.	O
It'll go.	O
I'm going to go in here.	O
And I'm going to come.	O
Select this area here.	O
Oh, another tip.	O
Every time I create a shape, for example like this, write an I color.	O
Can you see that?	O
That is, is it has sharp line around it in order to create more like a software line.	O
Here's how you do it, because in this case I am going to create us offline.	O
Um?	O
What I'm doing going to do is I'm going to move this layer up.	O
I call it chilling.	O
Impressed on L.	O
Can you see up here?	O
It's called feather.	O
This feather if I change to let's say 20.	O
And then I go around this uhm goal.	O
Texture and create the shape.	O
It will create a very soft edges.	O
Because in this case I'm going to have a very blurry looking radius edges, so I don't need to brush it off later.	O
See can you see is software now because it's.	O
Few small fish is maybe yes, I'll add that.	O
Change my brush just like this and I want you to look here right?	O
Can you see that?	O
Can you see that now it doesn't have the sharp edges is because I use the.	O
Feather.	O
Yeah.	O
OK, so the Black is too intense.	O
I'm going to just reduce.	O
The opposite teachers like this.	O
Let's see if I can bring the goal.	O
The shape and everything.	O
Go underneath my car, look up or underneath the shade.	O
I don't wanna look good but let me just see.	O
Yeah, I see I don't really like the color.	O
So let's just move it back up.	O
Yeah, cool.	O
Few fishes, maybe Ken.	O
Let me look for some fishes.	O
Uh, in my stock image.	O
I really like this photo manipulation come believe I'm saying this but young.	O
I really like it and I am going to look for some small fissures.	O
Uh.	O
I'm looking for stock images 1 second.	O
Oh before this.	O
I thought I would be nice to use a a fighting fish, but I don't know why I changed my mind.	O
Fighting fish are cool as well.	O
Their colorful, their graceful, but I change my mind to octopus.	O
Um?	O
Still looking for stock images once again.	O
For the part that takes a lot of time, is the soccer major.	O
Sometimes it is hard to find the right one.	O
Yeah, let me see if I can find the DP.	O
So how's everybody?	O
Let me see if I can find the right fish.	O
It did.	O
Small fish are small fissures.	O
I think I found.	O
One OK cool, let me just download this very quickly.	O
Um?	O
Can't seem to download this for some reason.	O
Let me see if I can taste it or learn near.	O
Yeah I found one, but it's too small.	O
But I can actually blur it up 1 second.	O
I don't know why it's so small as goldfishes.	O

I don't mind it.	O
I want it to be slightly blurred so it's OK if it's small image.	O

Blurry.	O
Yeah, like this.	O
OK.	O
Cool, so now I'm going to do a bit of masking.	O
Thanks are due for the suggestion.	O
OK, so that it doesn't look so empty.	O
All the reason why I put it there is because it's a bit empty underneath there, right?	O
So we can also change the levels.	O
There you go perfect.	O
Wow.	O
Yes, that works.	O

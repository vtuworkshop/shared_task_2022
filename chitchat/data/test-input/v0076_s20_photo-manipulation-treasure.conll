Convert to smart object.	O
Change to screen.	O
Because we already utilize it, we already have this light.	O
Here, so it doesn't make sense to add more of this light, but.	O
This so cool.	O
We can actually at this light summer here.	O
Octopus.	O
Let's go back to Lier.	O
Around here is like a Guardian of the goal.	O
Again, I don't know.	O
Cool is sleeping right now.	O
So yeah, I don't know.	O
Is playing with it.	O
Oh, I can actually place at the back of the touch.	O
So there's a bit of glue.	O
That makes more sense, so I'm going to hide it at the back here.	O
Great.	O
So there's like a glow around it again, I don't know.	O
I probably will shrink it this way.	O
Right?	O
So there is a good slowing.	O
OK, I like it.	O
OK.	O
Wow, cool.	O
Do I have any more anymore suggestions?	O
Oh, OK.	O
From my side to directly choose the layer I want I use auto select when suddenly is being choose.	O
I love the layer.	O
OK cool, I got you mean so here is asking.	O
May I ask how is your creative process?	O
How do you come up with the ideas of which manipulation to do?	O
I'm having problem to begin, I'm stuck in the process of constructing the manipulation idea.	O
OK, very good question.	O
I get this question a lot, um?	O
OK, what you?	O
The best way to do this is.	O
By practicing OK.	O
What's the right way to answer?	O
OK, if you.	O
If you see a stock photo right, there are a lot of possibilities for outcome that can be done from that document.	O
For example if like for example, this diver here, the original image of him is just swimming in the in the middle of the sea.	O
You need to utilize your imagination a lot.	O
For example, many things can happen inside the water, right?	O
For example, the diver is there.	O
You can place even life example if not this.	O
If not, octopus are probably will use.	O
All looking ship if I want to write write all I can even put a mountain and have a dog like a hole in the mountain but we didn't see you know what I mean so is as if he's going is about to get into the amount and I think it is all about imagination.	O
It's all about practice of thinking of the different possibilities based on only a single image.	O
For example all this started.	O
Uh, by just two creative process one I look back at my previous streams.	O
If you look at my food stamps.	O
I did science fictions before I've done like on the land, there's a lot of like a trees, leaves and statues and I was thinking OK I need to do underwater.	O
Of course I need to look for what's underneath the water, right?	O
So I went to my stock images and I start browsing to look for the right.	O
Stock image.	O
Um, an underwater creatures that's always there.	O
Like Fishers, this octopus an all these gigantic whales, dolphin shock and everything.	O
and I thought, OK, those are animals.	O
What are the subjects that I can use as a means subjects?	O
So in this case I'm using this diver by placing this diver I can create a lot of stories.	O
For example he is right now holding a touch.	O
I can even change it holding a spear right because of the hand and I can even.	O
Create like a a shot that's coming in front of him.	O
I think it is all about practicing.	O
I if you ask me.	O
I watch a lot of movies, I'm like a mouth and you can see my post that vector, right?	O
It's it's all about thinking right thinking beyond what people can think.	O
For example, see this is my concept right?	O
So I saw a diver.	O
There's a diver and op.	O
Toppers for if I take this diver an I give this talk image to somebody else.	O
I say Hey, you have to do something about it.	O
He will think another different ideas.	O
So it's all about thinking of the many different possibilities.	O

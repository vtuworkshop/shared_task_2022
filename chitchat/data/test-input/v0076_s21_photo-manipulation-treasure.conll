I don't know if I answer your question right, but it's all about practicing.	O
Just think look at the books.	O
I do read a lot of books, visual books, science fiction, movies, just.	O
Just sit there and think all of all the different possibilities that can come up from a single image literacy.	O
For me, I do a lot of research as likely reference, copy ideas and try to manipulate.	O
If you have a lot of reference ideas, you can combine it and sometimes you will come up to your mind.	O
That is what I do exactly.	O
Similarly, that's what I do as well.	O
I usually just sit there and look at stock images and something will hit your mind.	O
You just need to open up your nerves.	O
Right, saying that, give me ideas you know.	O
Again, I don't know how to say, but this is how I do things.	O
So yeah.	O
But I think I talked a lot but anyways.	O
Do I answer you Sergio?	O
It's all about practicing.	O
OK, right now I'm trying to do a bit of adjustment to the oral color based.	O
You know what?	O
My monitor have a.	O
Thank you.	O
My monitor is showing a different color and I'm watching the live stream example.	O
It looks different and, uh, I'm just saying and I saw that use 3D models for your photo manipulations.	O
Where do you get them from?	O
And is it better than the original stock images?	O
3D models.	O
OK, two things, right?	O
First you need to know what do you want to create.	O
The reason why is 3D models is because I couldn't find the right stock image, and sometimes they might look fake.	O
If you want a real person, you need to look for reimage so the 3D models that that I use is from Dusk, 3D.	O
Those are like a flat image that I modify on, but if you want a real image always user image from the stock images.	O
I use Adobe stock to find my documents.	O
OK, I'm going to Desaturate.	O
A bit of the colors.	O
Oh I I am.	O
I supposed to do another thing?	O
I am going to.	O
Create a little shading.	O
All right?	O
Not there above the octopus, yeah here.	O
Let's see if it works so that this you know how underneath the water.	O
This usually duck.	O
Let me see if I can create that one.	O
Change the normal.	O
Let me see.	O
Yeah, something like this, can you see that one, two or let me do that one more time?	O
123 value.	O
Yeah, that works.	O
That's exactly what I wanted.	O
OK, I saw that the focus is more towards the octopus and the diver.	O
Perfect.	O
Cool.	O
Nice.	O
So we have another.	O
10 minutes if you guys have any more questions so good.	O
Thank you so much for asking this question.	O
Yeah, creative process is always an also creative blog.	O
There are times where a lot of designers they just talk, for example.	O
They just in front of the computer and the like blank.	O
Probably they're working on something they don't know how to move on.	O
Here's my advice.	O
Take a graph of coffee or water.	O
Walk around your house or if you have the office, get up from your workstation, walk around an just don't think about the things that you're working on.	O
Don't think about like oh, what was that thing that I was working on?	O
I need to modify or change something.	O
Don't think about it.	O
Just grab your coffee.	O
Just think of anything else rather than the other day working on.	O
Look at the lights.	O
Look at the Leafs.	O
Look at the books or whatever.	O
For at least 5 minutes, come back.	O
See you be fine.	O
Creative blocking always happened to all the creatives.	O
The only way to get up out of it is by just get up from your zone.	O
And just walk around, see things, talk to people, come back you free up your mind and ideas will flow back.	O
Don't sit there and wish your time by by stressing yourself out.	O
Right, that's a very bad thing.	O
You will feel stressed and you cannot deliver your best.	O
So always get up from your your zoom and just move around.	O
And unit is saying how can you handle critics like if you posted sometimes in social media and not?	O
And look at this viewing.	O
Committing oh.	O
Critics is OK, it's good and you cannot stop.	O
This is like for real, you cannot stop critics an from coming in.	O

Cool.	O
Sure, and I'm going to do this.	O
And I'm going to do.	O
That And I'm going to do a beat.	O
Sure.	O
OK cool, let's zoom out so you can see is so strong, right?	O
Let's see a blending mode ever work.	O
Oh, that's cool.	O
OK it can.	O
You can always modify it.	O
Like this small object first, always always do that.	O
And you can always replicate it.	O
Right, there's another way of creating patterns.	O
I just draw using the and you can replicate.	O
It like this.	O
And replicate.	O
Like this?	O
So yeah, like I said, critics will come.	O
You cannot stop it from coming.	O
But you have the control of accepting it.	O
It depends how you accept it.	O
Don't don't take it to heart.	O
People have things to say.	O
Only take criticism that makes sense.	O
So what I'm doing right now is I just draw draw Patton and I'm just replicating it, filling up the space.	O
Within the canvas, so that there's a bit of pattern here.	O
Cool and other ways that you can do is you can also group it.	O
Let's call it.	O
Ann And you can always.	O
Blended.	O
Whichever way that you want, let me see.	O
Join works.	O
Well, this looks cool.	O
Ah.	O
Only so yeah, you can even do this right?	O
So if you zoom out.	O
Either.	O
So many different ways of creating patterns and always remember when you draw patterns.	O
Always use your brush and when you draw, make sure your smoothing is on.	O
Without smoothing let me show you if it's zero.	O
If I draw something, can you see the line is crooked?	O
It's like it's not smooth, right?	O
So make sure you on it.	O
Up here just change it to maybe 34 and now if you draw.	O
It's way smoother.	O
So yeah, let's quick tip.	O
Of drawing so, but I'm going to just switch back to the.	O

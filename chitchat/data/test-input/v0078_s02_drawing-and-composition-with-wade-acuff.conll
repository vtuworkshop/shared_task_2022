Yeah I'll go a little bit on the I'll go I'll push the lighter colors in a little bit but I'm going to crush these darks even more.	O
Crunch everything in.	O
I'm going to stay relatively lose on these anyway, so I'm not like.	O
Not really going for anything, I'm just kind of loosening up like I've mentioned.	O
OK, Cool Daniel.	O
Got all six characters roughed in.	O

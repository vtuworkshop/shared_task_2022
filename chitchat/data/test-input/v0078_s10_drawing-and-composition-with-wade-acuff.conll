And I like to do this just for my own.	O
My own giggles, I guess.	O
I really like making the tips that you're really red.	O
Lately I don't know.	O
That'll probably change at some point, but just for fun and.	O
You know, quick recognition that there's.	O
There's blood in their blood in there.	O
Sounded weird, don't know why it sounded weird, but.	O
But it still feels a little detached for Maine.	O
Not going to spend a whole lot of time making this year though.	O
Spent way too much time on this already.	O
Then I usually go in with like a little you know the ears.	O
Usually I know this might sound gross, kind of oily, or at least the skin texture is slick.	O
So you're going to get some odd reflections in there.	O
And it's reflecting the light in this case.	O
But not so much on the Lobe.	O
If you're looking at your love.	O
It tends to have a little fuzz on it, so it diffuses the light a little bit more.	O
Hum.	O
What else to say about an ear?	O
No, I don't want it to look like it's attached to the neck.	O
I'm gonna bring that little line that comes up.	O
A little bit further.	O
I hope some of this makes sense.	O
Another thing I like to do with female characters, which this started out.	O
It's not quite as female as it once was, I think.	O
But that's fine too.	O
Is, uh.	O
With the jaw area I like to soften.	O
The next between the chin and jaw.	O
Unless I'm going for specifically like Oh, you know they need to be.	O
They need to look like a chiseled jaw for some reason, which does come up from time to time.	O
But the reason being mostly is.	O
Does it have?	O
Men are usually associated with a sharp jawline.	O
And it helps cells, cells it a little bit more I think.	O
But again, it's not always the case.	O
Actually, I'm gonna use this, just straighten out our draw a little bit.	O
I don't want quite as.	O
Highlighted as it is.	O
But it will have, like the little little bit.	O
Probably more in here too.	O
All right?	O
Man, I still want to make sure this looks like it's.	O
OK, I think I think we can live with that.	O
I know there's like obviously there.	O
Sure, this would be all the probably have its own little here.	O
Here in light action going on.	O
Maybe even.	O
Right there.	O
I get it.	O
OK, I get it.	O
I will do this real quick as the last thing.	O
Change this brush.	O
Might get a little bit right there.	O
Something like that.	O
Anyway.	O
I don't know.	O

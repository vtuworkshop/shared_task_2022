So this is what we did for warmups.	O
This guy in this this lady.	O
Will leave it at that.	O
But now we will jump back into our.	O
A party planning here.	O
They actually took a little bit longer than I want to be out about an hour and a half hour and 1520 minutes left.	O
I'm gonna work on the composition of this and then work on cleaning up the drawing a little bit.	O
Will pull this up.	O
I think I still have it.	O
No, it's not in here.	O
Just to kind of recap.	O
Z.	O
Well, let's see.	O
Let's see if I can find this file.	O
Maybe it wasn't here, let's see.	O
Oh yeah, it wasn't here.	O
Yeah, here we go.	O
So just to recap.	O
So we did a bond of ice a bunch.	O
It was a few thumbnails.	O
Let me turn them, see them, turn them on.	O
There we go, did a few thumbnails working this all out.	O
Chose six and five.	O
Decided more on six.	O
You can't really read the number one and two 'cause they're yeah we go.	O
Yeah, so that's where we started with all of this, getting an idea of what we wanted.	O
Uh, I had a few ideas from that point and then we chose those two that took us too.	O
See.	O
Did not label is, so of course.	O
So these are the two that we landed on, changed a few things from this one.	O
And then wound up where we are now.	O
With this drawing.	O
And from their heads, more thoughts.	O
and I definitely have some anatomy stuff that needs to be taken care of.	O
Which is what we're going to do.	O
Tonight.	O
But first I want to work on the composition stuff.	O
And it's going to be.	O
So what I want to do is going to give me a little more room.	O
I'm going to bring everything over slightly again with.	O
This is where we started.	O
But the biggest change?	O
See none of this really matters, drawing Wise, 'cause we're going to redraw it anyway, or at least work on it.	O
So I want to keep trying to find a way to emphasize, try and emphasize the math and how just how large the Loxodon is compared to the rest of the characters.	O
And I want to try having her be hunched over the table.	O
Um?	O
Relatively same pose.	O
But allowing us to really encroach upon how big their space and how big.	O
Add to how big she actually is, and she's not doing it.	O
Intimidating, intimidating way 'cause they're all part of the same party, and you know that kind of stuff and plus it can give a little bit of a little bit more information to.	O
This guy's line of action right here is going to be more or less.	O
This.	O
Once we like, I wanted to look like he's kind of being pushed out of the way.	O
Um?	O
And this guy is the other ad sort of added bonus.	O
I think we can bring him in.	O
A little closer.	O
Again, will probably draw these, but just for my own.	O
So he gets brought into the Group A little bit more.	O
And I think that's going to help.	O

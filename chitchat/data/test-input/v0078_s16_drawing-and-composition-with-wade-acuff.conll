Candles and you know all kinds of stuff.	O
Maybe a Lantern?	O
I don't know, I don't know.	O
This guy has a.	O
'cause the braided.	O
Mohawk Get into the actual ends and outs of that in a later time.	O
That's not right.	O
Oh yeah, that was the thing I was going to work on me.	O
I don't want to add a table like ending weirdly right here.	O
It doesn't need to do that now.	O
It can just be extended.	O
We can have more papers on it or whatever we want.	O
Coming off doesn't even.	O
Long as I'm not making a tangent here, it doesn't really matter.	O
Oh yeah, that was the old finger.	O
Not the new finger.	O
New and improved looks at on finger.	O
Uh, yeah, and this guys anime face bothers me a lot.	O
A lot of work to do on this, but I'm going to do a, uh, think the plan is to do a mock up.	O
Hum.	O
Very scale.	O
Are you know, lighting sort of mock up.	O
So I can mess around with that before diving too deep.	O
Yeah, I think it was gonna have this guy leaning in a little bit more too, but I don't know that we need it.	O
So we finally got the real.	O
The real news.	O
The news of the summer for me and Sarah.	O
And I already planned on not going.	O
But, uh, uh.	O
Dragon con officially announced that they were canceling.	O
I mean, it's kind of obvious at this point, but.	O
They wouldn't release that info.	O
Mainly we think because they have a lot of contracts to settle and they wanted to make sure they work those out before they cancelled.	O
So that they weren't probably weren't responsible for any dead money.	O
Um?	O
In rolling over contracts to next year and that sort of thing.	O
Hopefully hopefully next year.	O
But yeah.	O
So if anybody didn't know there was going to drag con.	O
This happened yesterday, by the way.	O
Now you know it's official.	O
They took forever man they were.	O
They were holding out.	O
But we already have rooms for next year.	O

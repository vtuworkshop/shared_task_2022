Which seems to be the main problem.	O
It is flat in the background out to what I might do is.	O
Do something like this.	O
So that they're going back at an angle.	O
Obviously not.	O
I mean the bar and everything would have to be made.	O
To fit that, but.	O
'cause that's pretty flat.	O
I don't know if I like that.	O
Let's see if we did it this way.	O
Have everyone coming out at them a little bit.	O
That's not bad.	O
Then we could have room for like.	O
Little reflected beer bottles and stuff in the back.	O
Bring our heroes back to the forefront.	O
Yes.	O
Uh, it's a It's about that time, guys.	O
Will just recap what we did today.	O
We kind of did a little bit of it.	O
Went too long on our warmups.	O
Oh well, I could show you this.	O
You've probably already seen it, but these are characters actually.	O
You've got the T fling.	O
Who is?	O
Gentleman right here.	O
And then you have.	O
Our dwarven Bard Guy turned white look like him now, but he's going to have a beard and all that stuff.	O
That's This guy.	O
He doesn't have a beard 'cause originally he was over here.	O
And then we have.	O
River or go to the.	O
The cleric, which is terrible.	O
That this guy he is now over here.	O
And then our loxodon which I wanted to do more of a rough rough up paint.	O
Got it.	O
There we go, so we got that one done.	O
Um?	O
And then so those are these characters.	O
This is, of course, the luxilon.	O
I like the change of her leaning in.	O
Now, I really, I really think that helps the nude quite a bit honestly.	O
There's a lot to work out still, but.	O
I think this might be her other pauldron that's what that's called shoulder armor.	O
Yeah it is.	O
That is what it's called.	O
So yeah anyway, what we did tonight we we of course cleaned on the cleaned up this quite a bit.	O
We started with.	O
A couple of sketches, drawings whatever you want to call 'em paintings.	O
Real rough color paintings that were fun.	O
I'm getting in the mood for doing this kind of stuff a little bit more.	O
Usually start to warm up.	O
User is more than just a drawing, but like jumping into color and uh.	O
It's fun and then we cleaned up our party painting and that's about it.	O
Uhm yeah, so thanks everybody for hanging out.	O
If you want to know when I go live, follow me on Twitter at wait acuff.	O
It's on Twitter and Instagram is just at what you see down at the bottom right there.	O
I will be streaming again this Thursday.	O

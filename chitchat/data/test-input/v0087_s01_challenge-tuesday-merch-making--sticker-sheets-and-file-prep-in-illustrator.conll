Alright, I think I've got everything down here, alright.	O
So what I'm working on today is I've done some sticker streams before actually just one, and my process is I first start out with the right over here.	O
I kind of started actually is take you through the whole process.	O
From absolute zero, I start out with a kind of an idea list and the first idea list is honestly one that I don't always go to.	O
It just gets the ideas going.	O
So I had originally started out with kind of emotive stickers, just happy, sad, and I've done two sets with a similar theme before, so I was just like I don't really.	O
I'm not really on board with come with this idea quite yet, and then I was like, well, the cats name.	O
Is coconut an you know she's kind of named after food.	O
So what if I did a food, an emotion combination and so that's where my next set of idea brainstorming came from.	O
I started looking and kind of jotting down some different things that I could combine coconut with and so that's where the food list came in right here and then after I.	O
It's a little bit loud.	O
There we go.	O
Let me know if the music is overwhelming or if it's just um, levels issue with my sound isn't coming through all all of us.	O
Do some tweaking on my side.	O
But next step after I have my.	O
Kind of ideas a little bit more formed as I'll start rough sketching and you can see some of my rough sketches over here.	O
They're very, it's basically just to capture, oppose and an idea from words to a drawing.	O
So like for example here I went through a couple different ideas for bread, I.	O
I originally wanted to have her facing away, but then also I put what's the fun in that.	O
So um, I turned her around and that's actually one of the more simple ones, but it turned out really cute and I had a popcorn I had a I had an Apple and again these ideas changed a little bit as I went from my rough sketch to the final liner, coconut changed completely.	O
It was like a thing over her head.	O
But now it's kind of like she's peeking out from underneath the coconut, and I just felt it worked better because I had a lot of other designs which I thought was a cop out just to put the fruit on her.	O
I'd like just like a hat on her head, so I wanted to give a little bit more variety.	O
So there's that, and then you know here this emotion changed a little bit.	O
This one stayed the same.	O
I really enjoyed this one.	O
I changed the eye.	O
Can see this one.	O
Here is what will become spaghetti.	O
And here are the final sets.	O
I've got chips.	O
Here's the coconut that changed a lot.	O
There is the lime and this one, you know.	O
From the song lime in the coconut.	O
She doesn't like it.	O
It's too.	O
It's too tart for her and I really love the idea of.	O
Her personality is very.	O
Rambunctious so I figured she could be a T Rex Pizza and I also did a sort of a T Rex in the ice cream up here.	O
Gotta have a burger.	O
I tried to mix it too.	O
I tried to make savory and sweet.	O
I didn't want it to be all suites.	O
So I mean, I've got, you know some things that are just pure vegetable and fruit.	O
And that corn over here.	O
I've got a plate of pasta.	O
I really like this one.	O
I kind of this is a little bit of an abstract idea because the cat in question loves to consume my house plants.	O
So I wanted her to be like a lettuce Queen or at least clean.	O

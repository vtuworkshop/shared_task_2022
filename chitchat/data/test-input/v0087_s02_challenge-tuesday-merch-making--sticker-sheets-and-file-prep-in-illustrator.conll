And so I gave her a kind of a, you know, Royal ruffle and a Cape and she's kind of examining her relief of choice.	O
Um and let us eat as if she's saying to everybody we can.	O
We can now partake of our dinner.	O
And then up here, this one changed a little bit.	O
I wanted her to be instead of kind of standing in, reaching towards the reaching towards the worm, I wanted to be sitting kind of playfully bagging up at him.	O
So there's that one.	O
And then I wanted her to be eating.	O
Now I have a couple of him where she's eating the chips.	O
I really like that one.	O
In the app spaghetti place.	O
Dancing with her marshmallow friends.	O
And so yeah, so these two are kind of special because these were done in comics.	O
A little bit ago they were.	O
This was part of a Halloween like Pumpkin Spice Ball Contest comic and then this one was a another content.	O
Well, actually this is from the both the same comic.	O
I take that back.	O
Same comic.	O
It was like a contest of like a costume contest type deal.	O
And so I went.	O
I really love these designs, especially hurt peeking out from the pumpkin like she carved it just to get in it.	O
And she has her little footers down here.	O
This one I really liked how she's struggling with the The Latte Cup and it's kind of bending and folding around her.	O
So those are already done, and I've already kind of picked some colors.	O
I'll have to go through and pick a few more colors so I'll do that now.	O
And what I'm going to be doing mostly today is coloring.	O
I'll be coloring these guys and then I'll be arranging them into the final sticker sheets.	O
Which I can show an example.	O
Of my desktop is really a mess right now.	O
Let's see how to sticker sheet flips.	O
Let's just open us very good example.	O
So on this one.	O
There's going to be 2 matching sets, and I like doing them into matching sets.	O
I've got because I can't fit all of the.	O
Really, Comcast really come on here.	O
I have like a 0 transfer right now.	O
I don't know what my connection was doing and so sorry.	O
That looks like I'm back.	O
For whatever reason, that happens, uhm, so making two matching sets, I've got 16 notes, so I like to split the main eight and eight into the sticker sheet, and then I've done some little like mini support stickers just to add a little extra something, so you're getting more than eight stickers.	O
These are the large main ones, and I can actually show you the final.	O
How they came out.	O
This is the final on both of these.	O
Um?	O
This is designed on a 4 by 6 space.	O
And if you can't, I don't know if the lights going to hit it right.	O
I don't think you can see the kids cuts very well.	O
No.	O
Trying to almost you can see that little kiss cut down there almost.	O
Um?	O
But very nicely done, really nicely.	O
We can peel on.	O
Mystical poster stickers, but that's what I designed it around.	O
I feel like it's a good size, especially like if you're thinking like I am.	O
I'm organizing stuff to make a monthly sticker club.	O
Thinking about fulfillment 4 by sixes postcard size.	O
It'll fit in the standard envelope like a 5 by 7, and those are a stamp to Mail and if you want to put any extras in there, like extra stickers or a little mini printer postcards, it's still going to fit underneath the minimum weight, at least in the domestic US to ship that out.	O

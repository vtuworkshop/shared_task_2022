So thinking ahead is also.	O
A good thing to do when you're designing stickers and designing.	O
Products to sell?	O
You'll want to think about, OK, you know.	O
Packaging for this because you can't just stick it in an envelope and send it away.	O
It might get damaged.	O
Know how would you like to be a member of a sticker called paid?	O
You know your fee and then get damaged stickers in the Mail.	O
So it's something that you want to think about an always keep in the back of your mind.	O
Fulfilling things in the.	O
Well, it's same thing with shipping Prince.	O
And doing that, you always want to keep an eye out.	O
And.	O
Make sure you're sending products out that your product.	O
Um?	O
I'm just going through here and.	O
I wanna I want this to be less green, so I'm going to push it a little bit towards goals.	O
Writer.	O
Get a variety of colors on here.	O
Just so I can pick from and I know that they are always going to be right.	O
I want some Blues in here too because I wanna make Caesar.	O
It's an ice cream silliness.	O
Foolish greens.	O
Colors.	O
Do you like those?	O
Let's grab that.	O
I've got a reasonable range.	O
Is.	O
My yellows are a little on the green side.	O
And thinking about, uhm, the items I have to color.	O
So I've got burgers.	O
I've got apples, I've got popcorn.	O
I've got a donut, so I need a variety of different colors here.	O
So it's just kind of poached him.	O
Alright, I think that's good enough for now.	O
So what I just did, you can't see because my cameras blocking it, so I'm going to drag this out here and I just kind of composed a bunch of little pallets that I can pick from.	O
I will go in and adjust a lot of these colors, but it's just to get an idea of the colors I need and if I find one I really like, I'm going to add an adjusted a little bit.	O
I'm going to add it to my permanent palette so I can go back and keep.	O
Those colors consistent throughout each of the characters, like for example her orange.	O
That is something that I think is right here at the top.	O
It's right here and then I have her body color right here so these two are going to be very consistent throughout the entire series and then her tail color is probably this one right here.	O
Maybe a little bit darker.	O
But so I have those ready to go and ready to.	O
To just color picking and go.	O
So let's get started.	O
And first of all, it's safe 'cause I don't know what I did too.	O
To make that file not to.	O
And it's safe so they don't think I do.	O
All right?	O
So let's start with this guy.	O
And just proceed through.	O
All right, and let's pick up her range.	O
The main add tools I'm using here to color are the pencil tool and the blob brush.	O

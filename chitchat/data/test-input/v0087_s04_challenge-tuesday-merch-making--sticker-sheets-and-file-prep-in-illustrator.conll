So if I create a fill that goes in an area and let's say I miss like this corner, I'll select that piece and I'll take the blob Russian, I'll just color in where it missed.	O
I find that's a lot easier to do also.	O
Often just color pic from things that I already have on the canvas.	O
Damn.	O
And I do want these to be grouped like the color kind of separate from the liner, so I'm in a group this at this stage right now go into the group and I still have my things separate, but I still have my line art together, so that's something that you want to keep track of.	O
Always, when you're doing kind of mine, my messy style of illustrator trying.	O
This character is very rambunctious.	O
She is based off a real cat and that real cat may come on stream, but they've been staying away from.	O
Add a stream lately.	O
I just wanted to get her tooth knocked out there, so I went and again, here's another way that you can really quick go up and down in your groupings with any isolation event.	O
You'll get a list of what group you're in up here, and you can step back a couple directions if you need to.	O
If you don't want to necessarily leave the entire group.	O
Ann But I find that keeping the color and everything all together is just a lot easier on me in the in the future, especially when I'm making.	O
Making files like these that are for print.	O
Um?	O
So here's an example of a tiny little space that I notice you can see it down here.	O
I've got my blob brush and then I'm just drawing in here to fix that little bit.	O
Um?	O
Yeah, something good.	O
And then you know if I want to come, I probably should have.	O
You know what?	O
I'm just going to extend this.	O
I'm going to cheat a little bit and extend this color flips this colored piece over here.	O
Because I already know it's underneath.	O
And then now selected there we go wait a minute.	O
Why isn't my?	O
Merge only with selection.	O
Why are emerging?	O
Why are you acting this way?	O
That one worked.	O
Yeah.	O
So what I did is I just extended this shape since it was so close and it's going to be covered by the liner in anyway.	O
Oh shoot.	O
I did I copied it from my old file an I did not add it to my old file.	O
Thank you for the reminder, Chris.	O
At that.	O
Thanks.	O
I'm guessing it.	O
That's.	O
And we add this line to my file.	O
So I don't forget it again in the future.	O
There we go save.	O
Alright, we're good.	O
Uhm, I hope that update did that update.	O
Is it showing now?	O
We changes have been saved alright.	O
Hi.	O
Where is that OK?	O
Now it's working.	O
OK, good.	O
And let's see I want to.	O
She's got an ice cream cone which is going to have a little bit of just picking the color.	O
This isn't going to be the final.	O
Um?	O

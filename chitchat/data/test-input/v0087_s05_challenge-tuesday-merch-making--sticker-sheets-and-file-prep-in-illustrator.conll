Someone add a little bit of the gradient.	O
An actually I want to explore my um.	O
This year So let's go to the gradient.	O
Let's take this in a really.	O
Come on.	O
Always does this to me.	O
I don't want this to be that big.	O
There we go.	O
And then I'm going to add maybe this kind of.	O
Waffle cone color and make it a little bit more saturated.	O
Kind of like a more Golden.	O
I am happy paper one.	O
I am happy paper Indiana.	O
Actually, I'm also the person in the costume.	O
If you're ever well for conventions ever come back and you see happy paper in costume that is new.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go over here and I'm just going to color my sprinkles.	O
I want a nice even distribution of colors, so I'm just going to pick some random sprinkles.	O
And make sure they've got some cute colors.	O
There may be a nice green in here.	O
Maybe actually more of A.	O
There that's better.	O
And I need a yellow and maybe a purple.	O
Nice, that's true green.	O
I'm a little bit.	O
I don't like it when they yellow us is on the dinner side, so I'm pushing it over here.	O
I like that better.	O
Oh, thank you so much, canal.	O
Yeah, see I know no donut, no donut time on the screen on this year.	O
Keeping an eye on my screen up here so I can check colors and saturation as well.	O
Make sure everything is accurate.	O
The second thing is gonna be a deep purple.	O
Yeah, I like that.	O
Alright, so I've got a rando here.	O
I think I can stand to make this guy up blue.	O
Here we go.	O
Thanks.	O
No.	O
That is true, though.	O
Donut Science is a real thing, because if you have an improperly sprinkled donut, your donut experience is not going to be optimal, so I maintain all of my donut claims.	O
On the proper amount of sprinkles.	O
Let's see I kinda want this to be.	O
I don't want it to Orange, but I don't want it to match her body, so maybe this will be a chocolate ice cream.	O
And in the same vein, if I have a shape that's overshot its area, I'll go in, select the shape and just use the blob brush to erase edges, and I'm cleaning up a little bit.	O
I don't know what's going on if my connection today, it's very frustrating.	O
I'm sorry if you're seeing a lot of lag right now, um.	O
Hopefully that's going to clear up just like it did.	O
And get me general in this shape, because it's going to be on the bottom layer.	O
And I know we have to clean up that area little bit.	O
Go.	O
All right?	O
So I'm going to come in here and take some shading.	O
Echo here transform.	O
Music is perfect, all good.	O
I messed with the levels 'cause I was watching a movie last night, so.	O
Uh.	O
And it was an older movie and.	O
All of my sound had to go up so.	O
Factory.	O
Alright, I need to extend this a little bit 'cause he missed.	O

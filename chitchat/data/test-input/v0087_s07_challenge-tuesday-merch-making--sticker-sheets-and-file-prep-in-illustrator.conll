And I need to make her little.	O
Right?	O
And she's got sharp little things.	O
Not an overlay though.	O
Normal 100% so they can stand out a little bit and little sharp little things.	O
He was apart.	O
Alright, so I think that's good for this sticker.	O
I'm going to proceed on always save.	O
And I'm going to proceed on to the next one.	O
I might come in and do little tweaks later to just kind of.	O
Like I may I colored this one along time ago.	O
I may make tweaks to it to make it all more of a cohesive set.	O
Same thing with this one.	O
I might change up the colors a little bit.	O
So let's go on to the burger.	O
I kinda like this one.	O
That's not how you can have your burger anymore, 'cause I need it.	O
Actually I'm in the middle of it.	O
Coco logic isn't the best logic.	O
But it works for her.	O
A little bit alignment.	O
And maybe.	O
Let's see, I've got an extra lines here is kind of making an unpleasantly moist air announcement.	O
They did that to get texture to the actual broker over here over here too.	O
and I I'm thinking those are going to be.	O
Tomatoes.	O
So I've got a couple of different colors.	O
I'll be working with here, but again, as with the other one, I'm going to draw in a few of those color.	O
Areas so I can come.	O
Really.	O
I just Taxi boy.	O
He might join us, who knows?	O
He's scratching their his scratching post right now, so.	O
Would be appropriate.	O
He joined us when I was drawing his sticker set.	O
Which would be and I had to sign those, yet they're going to be Indiana Jones themed.	O
So I took the Jones.	O
Alright, so I've gotten those two shapes done.	O
I'm going to go ahead and group this.	O
And then get into my group.	O
I still have my line art on its own line and I can continue coloring.	O
I'm gonna do some bright crisp lettuce.	O
No.	O
And I'll do a little bit of detailing to give that.	O
How to solo mark hiring.	O
Shining here.	O
All right?	O
I'm just laying in the flat colors right now.	O
Go in animalistic some tomatoes under here.	O
Red And then we need our Golden cheese.	O
God.	O
And then my burger color.	O
Spot here that needs a little help.	O
There we go.	O
Another spot blue OK?	O
OK.	O
Clean up a little bit of use.	O
I usually come back from doing my daily painting.	O
I'm not going to come in and care much about.	O
Spots like this 'cause it's just a day late and end.	O
It's not for any unless it is for something special.	O
Then of course I will be, but this is for a printed items so I want to make sure my color fills are nice and.	O
Nice and tight and they don't have any.	O
You're missing out.	O

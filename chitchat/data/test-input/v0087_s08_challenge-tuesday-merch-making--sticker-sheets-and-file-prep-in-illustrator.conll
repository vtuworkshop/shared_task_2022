Send that to the back.	O
And let's bring this up here.	O
To the back.	O
And no, I'm gonna pick my burger color, which I think I can make the same as the.	O
The.	O
The cone.	O
And I'm going to hit the sesame seeds with a different color.	O
I actually might make well, this seems like a pretty pleasant burger color.	O
Um?	O
Maybe more of a pretzel roll.	O
Alright, let's go in here and here we go.	O
To the back over here.	O
Enjoy these last two bits.	O
And send them to the back and then select all of these guys an edit my gradient throughout.	O
Just bring it down a little bit like that.	O
I think what I'm going to do is I want this to be a little lighter, so I'm going to come in here.	O
Select this color and bring it up a little bit.	O
A little bit on the lighter side.	O
And colour checking.	O
Also who I like that.	O
Actually I brought it right back to where it was, didn't I?	O
Right, so this has this over here.	O
Alright, I need to also this guy up here nor Anne.	O
Now let's grab her tone colour and fill in her little tongue.	O
She often sleeps with her tongue out.	O
Kinda funny.	O
Ask a minion.	O
So this morning should be black and.	O
I'm learning.	O
I've caught it on a card on the camera couple times.	O
Oh, thank you Cortana.	O
I'm glad you like it.	O
I'm rejoice streaming.	O
How I do things?	O
Push this a little towards blue and saturated.	O
And that come in here 'cause I wanna really pretty rich.	O
Offset this brightness.	O
Oh Nice little not not what I was thinking I'm smoking, let's make it.	O
How much fat?	O
And then I'll just catch his parents eat down.	O
That's a race.	O
It where it's falling on my bun video.	O
Clean this up a little tiny.	O
And let's just draw a little shaping here.	O
And I'll come through.	O
And Olson knows back.	O
Little bit later.	O
Then I might erase the entire thing if I decide I don't like it.	O
I'm just thinking about the places where.	O
Nevertheless, is holding over a little bit.	O
Or it's kind of dipping in?	O
I think that's great, and then I'll take this color.	O
Back And then take this color and I know push it a little bit towards yellow a little bit more saturated and a little bit brighter.	O
Let's see how that looks kind of on the tips where the light is going to hit.	O
See you all that much I need to make it brighter.	O
Maybe bring it up and bring it up with a little bit more.	O
That seems to be a little bit better.	O

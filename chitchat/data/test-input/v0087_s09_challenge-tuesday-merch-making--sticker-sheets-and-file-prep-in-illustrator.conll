Let's add that to my doc.	O
Just make it a little bit transparent here.	O
Good, let's get my sesame seed squared away.	O
No.	O
I'm gonna do it.	O
That shading color and let's do a little bit of something.	O
Something over here.	O
Maybe not that dark, maybe just dismiss later there we go.	O
So she's right behind here.	O
And this, uh, I don't necessarily need to color this.	O
Because this is underneath the.	O
Underneath here Let us, so it's going to be not as saturated and bright are Ed, but I still want it to appear as like.	O
This is a red.	O
This is a tomato.	O
So now we just drop it down a little bit like its own.	O
Like it has a little shadow on it and if I want a tiny bit of shine, I'll come back with the original an just pop it in right there.	O
And let's see, let's do some little bit of shadow work over here.	O
Because we've got this whole thing was kind of.	O
Pizza.	O
Settings.	O
Little bit.	O
I know.	O
Something something on this one.	O
And I do want my sesame seeds to look like there sitting on top of the Bun Sun.	O
Gonna hit the.	O
Mrs here without really I said stop.	O
That's about point size I need.	O
We hit them also very little touch his shadow.	O
Supposed to get him.	O
Little.	O
Better personality thing.	O
I'm always keeping in mind when my light is coming from.	O
Nothing.	O
Look like they're little maggots sitting on top of my burger.	O
Maybe I'll think about that a little bit.	O
A little bit more.	O
All right, but I do know I can do is hit Miss being here with their shadows in her ears.	O
And I can come in here since her mouth is kind of curling over her tongue in a little shadow here.	O
And this is the corner of her mouth.	O
There's gonna be a little shadow there too.	O
And since her head is over her her chest right here.	O
This is going to have some shadow.	O
Yeah, little bit darker.	O
'cause I like can't exactly reach there as well as it can and other places.	O
I'm a little bit over here too.	O
Maybe a touch here.	O
Going here and do this.	O
Just just choose.	O
A little bit of line texture.	O
Color I really want to.	O
Better, I think on my screen it's far more saturated than we are seeing on himself on.	O

If I can.	O
Use the space to make a sticker.	O
I'd really like to do it, so I'll that's the next part.	O
Is arranging them on the page, which will be similar to this.	O
This is my final page and cut file for the flu stickers that you can see right here.	O
Um?	O
If you look over here on my layers palette, I have a cut lines layer.	O
I had a sticker art layer and I have a background layer.	O
Uhm I think probably the only thing that's really important that you have separate out is the cut lines.	O
Unless of course your printer wants you to set something up differently.	O
Always check their guidelines, always make sure your files are matching to their their art sections.	O
But yeah, so these cut lines.	O
I went out and I actually I simplify them a little bit, maybe a bagel maybe I've got a donut here, so it'll probably be the same, you know.	O
It'll be a little bagel.	O
Um?	O
Well, see, I'm going to make a list of the things that I need to put on there.	O
But here my little support ones here and since the flu summer always hanging the forest around mushrooms, I did a couple of mushrooms sets in some leaves and those added a, you know, a nice amount of stickers and then I did 2 little extra flutes that are the same on each sticker sheet so I might do an extra little Coco remote of her doing something.	O
Exasperated or I'm excited?	O
Something I can put, you know, as a little extra in there, but that's how the final thing will be.	O
This red line is my bleed for the PayPal page.	O
Again, this is something you want to check.	O
It's usually 8 inch around, so half inch blade or sorry quarter inch bleed all the way around, 1/8 on each side.	O
And you can set those up so you get your guidelines.	O
That's when the print out of the page prints.	O
If it moves a little bit, it won't be.	O
The artwork will be cutoff.	O
You will have a white line or anything even extend out.	O
To do that please.	O
Uhm, but yeah, so that's how it will end up and it'll be a same format.	O
I'll have the title appear, volume, volume 2.	O
Um?	O
You know, before the cocoa sticks.	O
So yeah, let me save one more time and I think that'll be it for me today.	O
If you would like to find me on other social media, I do stream on Twitch as well.	O
I stream on Behance Tuesdays and Thursdays and on Monday, Wednesday, Friday I'm on Twitch.	O
Let me Wednesday, Friday, streams or later in the evening they start around 4:00 to 5:00 somewhere around there.	O
It's not a set because if I'm doing a lot of work it'll be later in the evening or 5.	O
You know, have some scheduling thing or get it done earlier, so that's a general area.	O
But as far as we can see goes on live at 11:00 AM Tuesday and Thursday for three hours.	O
So if you want to join me again, I'll be back on Thursday and I'll be doing lots of comics stuff.	O
I do post comics twice a week now on Tuesdays and Thursdays Fridays, so the Friday comic I actually make live on stream so you can watch all those with it together if you like.	O
Come on the left hand side of my screen on my socials.	O
That's where I post my daily page on Instagram and Twitter, and comics glove everywhere.	O
So I try to keep the content a little different at each on each social media thing.	O
Facebook is a little more curated.	O
Twitter and Instagram get all the dailies.	O
And of course the website gets updated first with the comics, so thank you so much for joining me.	O
I hope you have a great rest of your Tuesday.	O
Remember to stretch.	O
Take your breaks.	O
Hydrate and make awesome art.	O
That Santana thank you so much for joining.	O
Have a good rest of your day.	O
I'll see you guys next time.	O

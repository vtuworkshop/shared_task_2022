So it's really cool that you know they really encouraged us to.	O
And when I say us I mean like everybody in the community that mean he.	O
Andrew Ha Creado who's the one who has been behind cancel con created on Adobe live.	O
All of these assets and then ended up sending them to you.	O
So.	O
If if I know I can see that My Internet is going a little bit slow, so I'm trying to mention.	O
Mention that quickly.	O
To try to see if.	O
Um?	O
So anyway, so just trying to like clean that up a second 'cause I notice that the Internet is like really bad and I really apologize for that.	O
It's not very good at all.	O
OK, so anyway, so I wanted to create something, so let's go ahead and get going.	O
So the first thing I want to make sure that this is papercraft, and so recently if you guys have been following along what I've been doing now is.	O
I've been modeling everything in 3D and so in the 3D program that I specifically uses blender.	O
So the first thing that we're going to do is we're going to add a circle.	O
And we're going to go ahead into the side view, right?	O
'cause blender or 3D you have orthographic, or you have user perspective.	O
This is orthographic.	O
It's bit more flat and I need to go into edit mode.	O
I'm going to go ahead and fill that circle and then I'm going to extrude along the Z axis, which is the blue.	O
All right, and so now if I go into top mode, you can kind of see.	O
That it's filled for sure, and then I'm going to like go to the side and will see like.	O
OK, that's how deep it is Alright?	O
Well, we got our circle that's really easy.	O
OK, so now I'm going to go back into object mode.	O
I'm going to go ahead and get a cube.	O
And the cube is underneath it.	O
Actually, I just do another circle.	O
Cube Cube Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and move that along the Y access.	O
And we're going to go into 7.	O
OK, cool and we're going to go ahead into edit mode.	O
Alright, so the first thing is that this whole thing is actually pretty big.	O
It doesn't need to be this big, so I'm going to go ahead and make it a little bit smaller.	O
Again, going to move it down to the Y Axis Alright, and I want to.	O
Select this face right here.	O
And we're going to grow that along the X, so that's me hitting G.	O
Alright, and we're going to go ahead and do that on this side too.	O
All right, very nice, and you can still see.	O
That, and I'm going to go ahead and actually just so like we're not looking at anything.	O
Weird here alright?	O
So I'm going to select a.	O
Alright, so I think if I do this 90 degrees, yeah, that's what I wanted.	O
Alright cool, so now let's go ahead and get our.	O
Move tool, so we're just going to move it down here.	O
And then here.	O
All right, and it definitely needs to move up so we can see what we're doing now.	O
You guys definitely can see that this is super sick, right?	O
We need it to be way center.	O
That's just one of our problems, so I'm going to go ahead and select this space and move inward a bit, let's see.	O
Yeah, that looks good all right.	O
And then we're going to go ahead and move this.	O
And we're going to go ahead and move it that way.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and select the whole entire thing.	O
Alright, and I'm going to zoom in.	O
I'm going to like look at these tick marks so we have those one that's this green one right?	O
So that is why.	O
So, the way that I remember them is that I think X for stop and so that's red and wife are green which is go which is green.	O
OK so so anyway so I want to pull this up.	O
Kind of right here at this line.	O
Now if I'm having trouble seeing I can kind of move change everything until like wires.	O
And so at this point, Hey, Good Morning, Mom.	O
Um, my mom always comes into my life stream and I love it, OK?	O
So right now we're going to.	O
I'm just kind of using the grid here to kind of make it even OK, so that is where we're at.	O

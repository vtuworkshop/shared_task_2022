I can definitely see that there's a lot more space here on this vertical, so I'm going to go ahead.	O
I'm going to select the whole thing and we're going to scale along the Y axis.	O
Uh, not, maybe not that much.	O
Maybe like that sounds good.	O
OK yeah, that looks good.	O
Alright, so now that is done, you can kind of see that's the wire frame of it all.	O
Alright, I would say that I don't know like The thing is, is that we're turning something in from a 2D2 or 3D, so there are some.	O
Licenses we get to take with it.	O
You know, we like is it flush is it?	O
Is it poking through the whole thing?	O
We don't necessarily know, uhm?	O
Because right now, if we want to look at it from X Ray view, you can see that there's definitely it's not going all the way to the bottom right, but I don't think it really needs to for this.	O
So we're just going to go ahead and call it a day.	O
Actually, no, let's go ahead and do it.	O
OK, so let's go ahead.	O
We're going to.	O
We're going to pull that and we're just going to.	O
I'm going to zoom in so I can see them doing.	O
I'm just going to pull that face down all the way to the bottom.	O
There you go.	O
Alright, sweet, so there we go.	O
Let's change this from wire frame to solid so we can see that.	O
Let's get rid of the X Ray view.	O
Alright, so there we go.	O
So maybe.	O
We would want this space to be a little bit taller, OK?	O
Wants to be A baller.	O
Sorry, all of a sudden I started think of kilo.	O
Alright, so now that we have that done, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back into object frame, going to shift D coupes.	O
There you go and I moved it, but it got moved.	O
Kind of wonky, but that's alright.	O
So what we're going to do is we're going to go back into wireframe mode.	O
7.	O
So we can.	O
So we can move it all right?	O
But what I need to do is I need to control a an.	O
I need to apply.	O
All these transformations.	O
OK cool, alright?	O
So we're going to go ahead.	O
An one is definitely higher than the other.	O
Find a good bit.	O
So I would say OK, so we have that.	O
So now I think we're going to do is I'm going to select both of those things.	O
And we're going to.	O
We're going to move it all that way, just a tiny bit.	O
Hum.	O
Alright, maybe we need to move him back down just to just to her just to her.	O
OK.	O
Alright, so now that's what we have going on.	O
I would say this whole thing needs to go back.	O
I will go one.	O
When zoom in, it doesn't need to be below the line, it just needs to be on it.	O
Alright, cool.	O
All right, so the next thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and now that I understand that might be hard to see.	O
Hopefully that right there made a little bit better and believe it or not, we're actually almost done.	O
With.	O
This.	O
Alright, I kind of like the idea of one being higher than the other.	O
So I'm going to go ahead and do that.	O
Actually.	O
And somehow undid it.	O
Alright, let's do this again.	O
Alright, so there we go.	O
Alright, cool and so now it's time to.	O
Make the right.	O
Make the piece that goes across it.	O
Now I'm going to go ahead.	O
And actually duplicate this so shift D.	O
And we're just going to go ahead and move it.	O
That's fine.	O
Alright, let's rotate it 90 degrees.	O
I did that absolutely wrong.	O
Let's see, let's do it this way, 90 degrees.	O
Nope, that was wrong too.	O
Alright, let's do it this way.	O
90 degrees.	O
Yes, I did it right.	O
Only took a second.	O
But I got there.	O
Alright, and all we need to do now is figure out this.	O
Band here and we need to add that point.	O
Dissect some things right because like right now, if I end up I'm going to tab.	O

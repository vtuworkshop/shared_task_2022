I have a selected right cool.	O
And we're going to go ahead and move this all.	O
And we are going to.	O
Scale in general.	O
Alright, let's scale it some more.	O
Actually, I guess we're going to move it.	O
All right, and let's scale it a wee bit moa.	O
All right, and then we need to do this little wire frame thing so we can kind of see make sure that this is in the Middle, 'cause That's kind of a big deal, right?	O
All right, and this is 1234.	O
So it's not actually all for, it's more like 2 1/4.	O
So what I need to do is I need to select holy granola.	O
Which one did I need to select this tough one?	O
So I need to select this face right here.	O
Nope, not that one.	O
This face yes.	O
And I need to move it out.	O
To make sure that it's even.	O
All right, and you guys are probably wondering how are we going to get this curved edge?	O
Because you can see that there definitely is a curved edge right here on this, but.	O
And there's not a curved edge.	O
On on what we have.	O
So what we're going to do?	O
We're going to go back to solid view, and we don't need this.	O
As we are going to subdivide and what subdivision does is that it essentially adds more geometry and more points for us to mess with.	O
Alright, so we did for we're going to do that over here too.	O
1234 cool, alright, and we're going to go ahead and mess with this one first.	O
So again in 3D, whenever you're working with 3D, you have edges, faces and vertices to manipulate, and that's how you.	O
Manipulate them.	O
All right, we're going to go 7.	O
And we're going to just pull those back a little bit.	O
Alright, and now we're going to go back.	O
And we're going to select this edge loop.	O
Actually in each deselect everything.	O
Alright, so like this edge loop come on Boo.	O
And this edge loop.	O
No wrong one.	O
I'm trying not to like twist all the way.	O
Which I don't know why, alright, and now we're going to.	O
Go back a little bit more.	O
There you go and now we got a curve.	O
We're into it now, did this time.	O
Now I can't select this edge loop because if I do notice what happens and ends up selecting everything and the and the reason why it does that is because.	O
Uh, it can.	O
I don't know how to explain it, but it's a connected path.	O
It doesn't end and I am in Gonan in gone is just not a Polygon.	O
All right?	O
So I'm just going to slide it back a little bit.	O
Alright, now I'm going to go back now.	O
This on the other hand, doesn't keep going.	O
There's not an edge on the other side, so I can just select the edge loop.	O
Find simple short key which is really nice.	O
Alrighty, what, what what happened?	O
Alright, select you select you 7 to change my view.	O
Wow, I really.	O
There we go.	O
Alright cool alright.	O
Now let's look at it from the side sweet now technically speaking.	O
I don't need it to be so tall over here on the bottom.	O
All right?	O
So what we're going to do now?	O
Let's see.	O
I should have fixed this to begin with, so I I messed up.	O
So like now if I end up going and doing um Z up.	O
You can see how it ends up.	O
Like it works really well until I get.	O
Here and then.	O
At that point it kind of messes up, so excuse me, So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go into edge select mode and I am going to move.	O
Yet I'm going to select this.	O
And I'm going to move that up that matches there, and I'm going to do the same thing over Chor.	O
Again, I can just use my little hot key.	O
OK, and then from there.	O

Now the next thing that you would do is that you would take those file images.	O
And you would load it into your cricket.	O
Waiting.	O
Waiting.	O
Waiting, so I probably should've had this open for you guys Huh?	O
Alright cool so.	O
What you do then?	O
Is that you load it up now.	O
I have already obviously done this.	O
OK, uhm?	O
So what you do is that you load it up and you have to tell the machine what is scoring and what is cutting.	O
Now if you guys have been with me before, you know that sometimes what I'll do is I'll go into illustrator, Adobe illustrator and kind of clean things up.	O
This was a really small file and so I decided to go ahead and just move forward into the cricket.	O
Now what happens when I clean things up in illustrator is that you guys can see over here on the right hand side this is the shape that's on top right?	O
This is actually a shape right here and then you can see that there's like score, score, score score, score, score score, and so instead of the machine, or like the processing over the software reading of like just maybe 1 continuous scoreline, it's reading.	O
I don't know how many this is.	O
It looks like over 20 OK and this is one piece and if I zoom out.	O
Uh, I have.	O
I have a lot of pieces and so that's a lot of data for this to.	O
For this to process and so and it also takes a long time for it to cut.	O
So instead of just running one scoreline what it will do is that it will literally like put it down to that one.	O
Put it down to the next one, put it down to the next one, and so.	O
Uh, this is a one time use.	O
I was doing other things while all this was happening, so it didn't really bother me that much for it to take a long time.	O
But if there are things that I that I'm doing like.	O
UN stationary, for instance, if you guys don't know one stationary is on, stationary is a is my side hustle where I do 3D paper model kits which is really cool so you guys can find this on Etsy or you can do it here.	O
But as you guys can imagine like I don't want this to take a long time to cut right and so therefore I'm going to go into illustrator and I'm going to clean this out and making sure that.	O
Whenever I cut this, it happens really, really, really quickly.	O
So just you know something that's like really important.	O
Hey Mark, did you see you thank you so much for joining us today?	O
OK, so so after I clean it up in Adobe I didn't are in illustrator.	O
I didn't really have to do that.	O
Here.	O
I go ahead an I cut it out alright so but guess what guys and this expedited process of today.	O
I actually have some of it cut out for us now.	O
I don't know why my overhead thing is not working.	O
Oh, it's not working at all.	O
Ah, so you had me twice.	O
Double vision OK.	O
Alright so let me put this for loading just a second.	O
And get it fixed.	O
Alright, let me get this fixed again.	O
'cause this is just this is just crazy.	O
You guys don't need all this Alright?	O
Oh wow I have it wrong this is insane.	O
Alright let's do this again.	O
Man, it would be so good to have like somebody helping me with all this so I don't have to do this all by myself.	O
Alright cool alright so we've got chaos.	O
Chaos is done alright so I have some of our pieces already cut.	O
I have the white piece and then I also have the black piece all right.	O
So this is actually one of the easier of the two and whenever you guys get this from your crickets or going to have the score marks again because you already designated that this needs to be a score Marca.	O
Why in the world?	O
All right, so let's go ahead and change this.	O
Let's Come on, we can do it yes, alright, cool and I need this badge to go away.	O
Thank you very much.	O
Alright cool So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and do a.	O
Fold here along those score lines.	O
Now it's not as crisp as if you.	O
If you would do it with a back of an exacto knife or anything like that.	O
It wouldn't hear it's.	O
That's way more Chris, but it gets the job done.	O
And there are two different kind of folds here.	O

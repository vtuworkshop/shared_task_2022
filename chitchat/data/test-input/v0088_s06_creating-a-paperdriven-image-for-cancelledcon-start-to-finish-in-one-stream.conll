You guys have.	O
You have mountain folds, which again you're folding away from you and ends up making the peak on the top right, and then you have Valley folds.	O
Which then what happens, is that instead of pulling the paper away from you, you actually are pushing it away from you.	O
You're pulling it towards you, and what ends up happening is at the peak, then is on the bottom.	O
And that specifically to like what you're touching it too.	O
Alright, So what I'm going to do I have my glue.	O
My craft drag again, I love these craft rags because they are course and I can.	O
I can get the glue of.-.	O
Oops.	O
OK, and this is going to be the little bar.	O
That goes in the center.	O
And I love.	O
I really love using the 3D modeling software.	O
This is a new addition within the last two months have been learning 3D modeling, but before that the previous three years that I was doing papercraft and I'm just going to kind of slide this to kind of spread the stuff.	O
Man.	O
I hate Jane, Jane said this is fascinating IVA silhouette.	O
And now I understand how people do 3DS and designs because I can't visual 3D at all exactly exactly and so like for the three weeks.	O
Or yeah, for the three, uhm?	O
I was going to say.	O
Over the three years that I did templates, I would always do it.	O
I would unfold it myself, meaning I would sit in illustrator and figure out the templates myself and it would take forever and I was always really limited with the understanding of what math to do.	O
Like I didn't 'cause it didn't understand math.	O
Um, very well.	O
And so anyway.	O
And that's really clean box.	O
That's really good all right now.	O
Hey Ashley, good to see you owe my goodness.	O
So Ashley and I went to college together, which is really cool and very long time ago.	O
Um, Alright, so you guys just saw that.	O
Would that?	O
Would those were mountain folds right?	O
I pushed it away from me, but now I'm going to be pulling these in towards me and so now we have Valley fold.	O
So those mountain folds and Valley folds, we're going to go ahead and do that again.	O
OK, and so Jane and this is also to everybody else who might be interested in all of this.	O
I do have a discord that I would love to show you guys.	O
Um it is.	O
OK, don't switch.	O
OK, let me go ahead to the screen.	O
All right, so it's this.	O
So if you guys want to join this makers place, this is a discord where we pretty much get to know each other.	O
But if you guys are interested in anything that is.	O
Like tangible, you make anything with your hands or like so woodworking rezan phone clay, polymer clay like you name it, this is the place for you and so here we get to share our projects which are really really fun.	O
These were some like paper creepers that we made.	O
We got some 3D rendering stuff that's going on in here.	O
We can introduce each other of course maker inspiration.	O
So everyday I share something that I end up finding.	O
That is handmade, and I think is absolutely amazing.	O
And then of course like I just like to collect colors and then feedback.	O
So if you have anything that's going on that you want feedback on, I think earlier I wanted feedback on these like two different color palettes.	O
I would love for you guys to join so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to copy this and I'm going to put this in the chat.	O
You guys are more than welcome to come and join us.	O
I would absolutely love to have more more of you guys in there.	O
Alright, so let's go ahead and move back to our crafting stuff done.	O
Sit it on OK, sweet so.	O
So our crafting here we're just going to do the top part of this SVG.	O
OK, hey Sean, thank you so much for showing up for joining me today.	O
OK, and so I'm only going to end up spending a little bit more time on this.	O
We're going to.	O
Finish this part and then I will show you guys actually what the finished product looks like because I know your time is valuable and you want to actually see a project that's finished from top to bottom, which you know hasn't really been the case a lot with me here.	O
OK.	O

So did I just put the wrong one on the wrong one?	O
It's OK.	O
OK, and so we have.	O
I think these are actually the same exact size.	O
Yeah, 'cause the other one would be longer so I only cut it a little bit of this because we have one that's completely done already and so now I'm going to go ahead and we're going to do the edge.	O
OK.	O
I'm going to go ahead and put glue.	O
On this tab.	O
OK.	O
OK, and now that we have this, I'm going to go ahead and do a whole bunch of Mountain folds.	O
So again, just pushing everything away from me.	O
And I just I love the final feel of.	O
Papercraft of, I mean a the tangible asset at the end just looks really cool when you photograph it.	O
In my opinion, like I don't know, I just really like it.	O
I started getting into 3D like I was saying, just like a couple of weeks ago or two months ago now and in started recreating some of my artwork that I did in 3D.	O
But recreating it in.	O
Yeah no, I did in paper, recreating it in 3D an sometimes I liked the 3D better, but most times that just the textures which is so much better.	O
All right, So what I'm doing now is before I glue this whole entire arc.	O
What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to do just one part first and once I glue that one part.	O
And I'm going to kind of push, right?	O
So what I like to do with the glue as I get kind of behind it and then I push it towards the towards the end towards the end.	O
And what that does is that that smears the glue and it doesn't create as much like wetness for the glue.	O
Alright, and now once I have my anchor point at this juncture, I can go ahead and start putting the glue everywhere else.	O
So I'm just going to go ahead and do it.	O
A thin line all around the edge.	O
Now notice that I'm not getting at the very edge because the way that I do this is I'm going to bring this inward and then I'm going to take this and then I'm going to push it out now.	O
I'm sorry if my head gets in the way guys, you guys get to see all my wisdom.	O
But essentially what I'm doing is I'm just pushing it out with my finger and I'm sliding it and it's really it's really difficult to do it when it's not on the table.	O
An again, by doing that I am.	O
I'm a, I'm smearing it, making sure that it doesn't create wrinkles, but at the same time.	O
Making sure that.	O
I don't put too much blue in its Excel on the corner.	O
That's help suck.	O
All right, hey, on a good to see you.	O
Thanks for coming.	O
Alright, so there you go.	O
So we have our edge.	O
Of course I didn't.	O
I didn't do this one but now we have our black little guy in here black bar and it will quite literally just fit really perfectly because again everything was done in 3D.	O
I know exactly that all of these things are going to fit together and so you're probably wondering.	O
Well, Alicia, what does that look like when it's done?	O
Because believe me, you guys don't want to hang out for the hour or so that it's going to take for me to do this.	O
So guess what done done it up.	O
I have it for you.	O
And it's done so this one is like kind of glue together, but I can pop out.	O
This piece because whenever I did.	O
The photo shoot.	O
Yes, spoiler alert.	O
I did do.	O
The photo shoot already and we will be looking at those images really, really soon.	O
But when I did.	O
The photo shoot.	O
I wanted to really kind of speak to the point that this is the second one.	O
So we've done one cancelled con already.	O
We're about to do cancelled con number 2 and so I was thinking.	O
I would be really cool to kind of have it coming out or like you know like I'm putting it in or like whatever.	O
And so anyway, so I just did the photos this morning.	O
And quite honestly, I haven't even looked at them like like my I Oh my gosh, it was so funny.	O
The amount of things that was happening this morning and I had to get my kids to help push the shutter button because I wanted all these different things happening simultaneously.	O
Ah, so anyway, Are you ready to see the photos with me?	O

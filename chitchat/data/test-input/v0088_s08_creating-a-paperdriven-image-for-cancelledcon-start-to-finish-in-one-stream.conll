Because who knows how good they are?	O
This is going to be really interesting.	O
Alright, so I pulled it up.	O
Let's go ahead and get you guys over there right?	O
So you guys are probably wondering what program am I using to review my images.	O
This is called capture one.	O
I probably will be switching actually over to Lightroom.	O
I've been in capture one now for a few years.	O
But yeah, I think that I'm going to be moving over here soon.	O
But anyway, we'll see.	O
We'll see all right.	O
So this is where we started out.	O
This was actually just using the lighting that's in my office.	O
Like for my studio, you can see that in Sri had 22nd shutters it was on my tablet anyway.	O
Started playing with it and that the whole idea from the very get go was like, what if we had light coming through the second one?	O
Like what if it was like OK?	O
This is cancelled con, but the second one is coming in and lights coming out and it's awesome.	O
But you guys can see what ends up happening whenever you blacklight paper normally.	O
When I know that I'm going to be shooting a light through something, I actually end up putting black paper all inside, so I end up double layering it, but I didn't get the idea to do the light until this morning, so that meant that I didn't construct it for this.	O
So I end up having some problems with that and I know that one of the ways in order to counteract that is to actually add another light to the scene in order to kind of light and that disparity up.	O
So there you go, added a light so you still have the fun light that's coming in through, and you can see that it's being illuminated, but at the same time you have this other light that is lessening the shadows there.	O
OK, so now now I got it.	O
I'm like OK, but at the same time when I did this I realized that we have this seem right here, right?	O
'cause you guys just saw me put these two images together so I was thinking like OK what can we do?	O
We can just turn it.	O
There we go and it blends in a little bit more.	O
You can still see the tab a little bit, but honestly I don't think anybody would be like oh that's the tab like I think it looks like it's part of the shadow.	O
OK, now one of the things while while this is good, this is getting where I kind of want it.	O
what I didn't like though is that you could really kind of see that the this red bar, right?	O
I'm like you thinking like, OK, I really like the red.	O
I really like the light shining through.	O
It would be really dope though if that was obscured somehow.	O
How could I obscur that hoe I know?	O
Let's put fog in the middle of it.	O
Sure.	O
Oh man, if I do anything, I do it extreme.	O
I'm going to go ahead and push one because I don't really know what happens after this because all of this stuff I was testing on my own as soon as I started getting my family involved, things got happened.	O
Really, really fast and I didn't get to look at any of the images.	O
So who knows, this might be the best one and you know what?	O
If it is, I'm not too upset.	O
OK, alright so we started adding fog to it.	O
You probably wondering how in the world at least it did you end up adding fog to this photo.	O
So the way that I added fog to the photo is that if you guys have ever had a leak in your house.	O
Uh, and you had, like engineer, come through all.	O
Thank you Sierra.	O
She says dope.	O
Mehmet says photos are really cool and Jane says Haha superb.	O
I really appreciate you guys like in this.	O
So fun.	O
So anyway.	O
So if you guys ever had your air conditioning or leaking or anything like that happening with your air.	O
What I've seen some air conditioning professionals do is that they end up having like a little handheld fogar right?	O
And so I'm like I want to buy one of those handheld fogueres so I can fog up my photos and so I bought one of those.	O
And this is what this is what it is I good morning, Austin.	O
Thank you so much for showing up.	O
OK, so there's definitely different levels of fog that's happening.	O
I have so OK that ones pretty cool because you can see the fall you can see that it's coming out, its trailing and you're kind of going like what the hey, hey?	O
What is all this?	O
I don't know.	O
That's kind of interesting so we'll keep with will keep that up.	O
Oh, that was even cooler.	O
This is going to be really hard guys.	O
Uh, that's pretty cool.	O
OK yeah, so I wanted to introduce my hand that was kind of a bigger thing in this whole thing is that I wanted to say like I'm part of #2 like like so I am.	O

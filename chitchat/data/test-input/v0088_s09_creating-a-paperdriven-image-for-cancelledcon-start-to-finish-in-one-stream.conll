If you guys still are wondering what is creative works let's see.	O
Here or not creative work sorry.	O
What is cancelled con?	O
I think we already kind of talked about this and I think it might be my history which would be a lot easier for me to find.	O
There we go.	O
So if you guys are wondering what is cancelled con, you guys can actually go to cancelcon.com dot webflow dot IO.	O
I know that's really hard, but if you just do cancelled con.com it's it's just going to like time out.	O
So anyway, it is digital conference that is happening between 11th and the 12, so that's quite literally this weekend.	O
And if the donation based on line variety show featuring an electric on line or line up, special guests celebrate the spirit of creativity and community.	O
An if you look hey hey, I'm I'm in there today so not in there today I'm in there on July 11th and BT dubs that's my birthday so I'm excited that I get to speak on something that I really find very important to me right in front of the mystery guest who drama the suspense.	O
So anyway.	O
It's really cool.	O
I'm really excited and I really think that you guys could come out alright cool.	O
So normally what happens is that if I am speaking at a conference or anything like that, I like to create something to say thank you essentially for having me because they didn't have too and I have had a lot of I have a lot of friends who are conference organizers and I just know the hell they go through and so I just wanted to say thank you.	O
Alright so I do like that hand in there.	O
I like the lighting.	O
The only thing is that it be really dope if.	O
If it was a pulled out a little bit more, I felt like that was a little bit too tight.	O
Uh wow, we're really getting Smokey over here like that is just insane but I like it so we're keeping it.	O
Oh, alright, and this is where I start adjusting the light so I get to the point where I'm not really happy about what's happening with the light and then at that juncture when I'm adjusting the light and I remember the smoke started kind of coming off.	O
Alright, so I did.	O
I did.	O
I thought I'd, uh, there you go.	O
I pulled it out but man, my arm does get a little weird because we are at a 32 millimeters.	O
So we started getting really like some distortion over here on the edge.	O
If I crop it into a one by one, maybe it's not going to be that big of a deal, but I do like the interaction of the hand in the lighting of the hand.	O
But I yeah, I definitely also really like the idea of both of these two being kind of lined up.	O
Alright, I like that one.	O
I like that too.	O
And my my battery start failing here.	O
Out and then I end up not liking the light, so of course I end up changing a whole bunch of things.	O
Light light, light.	O
I mean even that kind of cool where it's just the light in the smoke.	O
I think it's a little bit too off brand though.	O
That's kind of neat that this one were, like the smoke is coming up, but it's going above my arm, but I don't like how you can see that I really like it when the smoke is obscuring the center point.	O
There you go that I don't know.	O
I just had to do these so fast.	O
And that was it.	O
Right, so I says it reminds me of a video game cutscene.	O
I mean, I think that I don't know.	O
I just I don't like the hand modeling at all that's happening in some of these.	O
I think that ones OK.	O
Alright, so let's look we I picked 9.	O
Alright guys so right now let's just take a gander.	O
Alright.	O
What say you guys?	O
I would love to hear from you.	O
Should we go one with hand or without hand?	O
So you guys can see over here on the bottom we have some that are with with hands.	O
We have one 2 three that are with hand.	O
Or do we do without hand, so I'm going to just wait here for a second.	O
I'm going to enjoy my tea and I would love to hear from you.	O
Now there are 30 people watching.	O
I know you guys have to have an opinion.	O
Super thankful that you guys are here with me today that you could literally been anywhere else, but you decided to look at Smokey hands.	O
So thank you.	O
So hand no hand.	O

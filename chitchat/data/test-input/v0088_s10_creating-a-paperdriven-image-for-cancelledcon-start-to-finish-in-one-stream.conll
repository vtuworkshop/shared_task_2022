That's quite literally it.	O
That's all I'm doing.	O
That is all we're doing with the meeting with a photo.	O
Alright, Sierras his hand we could have vote with hand.	O
The first hand off to know man carry also says hand and Austin says the first hand.	O
My mom see Roskowski.	O
She also says hand.	O
So there you guys got it.	O
I'm going to wait five more seconds for three.	O
Hey.	O
And the hand gets it all right.	O
Oh, Rock Hill coming in Robert coming in Robert.	O
My son's name is Robert.	O
I already really like you, alright?	O
Uh, an Sean smoke around the wrists.	O
Alright, so we do alright.	O
So man, you guys are so mean a hand.	O
OK it's unanimous we are doing the hand let's do this thing alright oh little.	O
Dang, this looks great.	O
Already all.	O
Thank you so much.	O
Uhm OK so let's go.	O
She said 356 so she said 3.	O
5.	O
6 and then eight.	O
So let's look at all right.	O
So I'm going to go ahead.	O
I'm going to deselect all this.	O
Do select trying to do select.	O
You know, when you kind of forget how to do things like whenever people are watching.	O
OK, cool, so we have this hand.	O
We have his hand and we have no this hand.	O
This hand in this hand.	O
Alright, so these are three hands, OK?	O
Alright, I'm not liking the hand position here.	O
It feels like I don't know.	O
I'm not like in the hand position here.	O
Alright, so really, so let's go ahead and get rid of that one.	O
All right, so it's really between this one and this one.	O
Oh, Fudge Nugget.	O
Tonya.	O
This one yes in this one.	O
Alright, I it, this is really hard.	O
I would have to say 'cause I really like.	O
Alright, let's crop it in.	O
Let's do let's do it a test crop.	O
Alright so we're going to do a one one square ratio.	O
So that would be that square.	O
That would be that square I really like.	O
All right, and so now let's see what does the 1 one look like.	O
I don't know.	O
I would say maybe we move this remove this crop over just a hair.	O
All right?	O
So here's what I'm saying.	O
Alright, so the first one doesn't have that Red Band that annoys you.	O
Yeah, yeah, so here's what I'm thinking already, so now I'm kind of looking at the level of retouching that we have to do so, because that's going to play a huge huge amount of.	O
But at the same time, Alright?	O
So we're going to.	O
We're going to just look at our pros and cons.	O
Alright, so we're shell says the first one doesn't have the red band that annoys you, which is very.	O
That's very correct.	O
I love that this is obscured, but what I don't love about it is that you can see these tabs granted with a really quick heal tool, you would be able to clean it out.	O
But what I like about this is that it's also very, very stylized.	O
You're not getting the whole entire image, you don't need the whole entire image in order to know what to do.	O
So therefore, if you can visually reduce, uh, what you're saying, it makes what you're what the audience reads a lot clear.	O
So I like that a lot.	O
Uh, Andrew surprise, you see what I'm making for you.	O
So guys, Andrew Ha Creado who just signed into the chat.	O
He's the one who's putting of- creative con or not.	O
Yeah cancel Khan and so anyway, this is for you friend.	O
Thank you so much for everything that you're doing.	O
Putting together this conference 'cause I know it is.	O
It has so much work, so much work alright, so let's go and see back what you guys are saying.	O
So Sierra she says the first one my mom says serious kowski coming in lit saying the hand with the smoke around the wrist.	O
I guess that's the bottom line.	O
Robert says.	O
I really like the top hand photo.	O
We got two got 3 for the top hand foot with Jane.	O
Sierra says the first one looks like it's likely it's going in a second look like it's coming out.	O
Sierra, who I think that's going to be clutch man 'cause we really need to look like this is coming in.	O
This is the.	O
2nd Conference it's happening II invent so we really need to look like we're putting this in, um.	O
Cool so and then these look amazing, Andrew said.	O

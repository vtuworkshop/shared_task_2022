Finally made it haha.	O
Hi, Andrew said hit me up with these uh, will run some promoted ad over the next treated they are amazing.	O
Well it will be done quite literally in an hour because that's what we're spending our next hour on.	O
Alright, so there's a lot of heat already going for the first for the top image.	O
There is some retouching things that we're going to have to do.	O
However, we definitely have the tab that we need to clean up.	O
We have these.	O
Inside tabs that are glowing because there is that inner light that's happening and there's some glue, but overall, in the grand scheme of things, the retouching on this project is actually pretty minimal, so I'm really excited that I'll be able to go over some photo shop tools with you.	O
Often said maybe start with number one and then at the end of the conference use #2 going like it's a rap.	O
I love that often.	O
I actually did something very similar.	O
And I don't know if I have it.	O
I did something very similar with creative South.	O
I probably don't even have.	O
Actually if I go to dribble they might be there.	O
So creative South is another conference that happens in April that unfortunately got cancelled.	O
And I like having a a like having two different images when I do something for.	O
This is also so flare, so this might be a horrible way to show you guys.	O
I should have just went to like my local machine 'cause that that would been like way faster, but I had one for creative South.	O
That was so dope.	O
2020 you guys are going to see all my craziness personal.	O
At at three touched.	O
All right?	O
So we had this one which was happening.	O
I was thinking that it could happen like before the conference or it could happen after the conference because it could look like sunset or dawn.	O
And then I had the other one which was day.	O
So then you had the one that happened like during day and this of course is Mike.	O
So anyway, every single time I try to I do a conference graphic.	O
If somebody has me speak or do a workshop, I really love to say thank you by creating something because again.	O
It's a small way to support them because it is a butt ton of work.	O
If you guys have ever done this before, alright cool.	O
So back to our image.	O
We were going to go ahead and we're going to do this one, but instead of having it cropped, I'm going to go ahead an remove the crop because we're going to put the whole entire image, because who knows?	O
Goop snow?	O
Who knows honestly what Andrew is going to do with it?	O
Is at this juncture now we know that we're going to give it to Andrew.	O
Alright, so I want to go ahead an.	O
Just fill this out.	O
Alright.	O
Cool so you know what we haven't even done any coloring or anything to this.	O
Granted, I don't necessarily know if we need too.	O
I like as you can see I have my Outer Banks here.	O
My outer margins.	O
I have that as white because I can use that as a white guide.	O
So whenever I'm adding whenever I'm doing white balance, I already have that right there for me.	O
And I can kind of judge it against it.	O
Now the thing that I can share, though actually I'm just going to go ahead and like redo all that.	O
As I was shooting with daylight and you are not daylight, Yeah Day light bulbs.	O
So it really wasn't that big of a deal, and you know what I really kind of like the the curves that are happening like I don't.	O
Like maybe a little bit darker.	O
That red though does look a little bit orange to me, So what we're going to do is that we're going to select this red kind of in the middle.	O
We don't want to go over here, and we don't go in the dark.	O
Um an.	O
I'm just wondering if we can't do not pink it up.	O
We want to read it up.	O
That's orange.	O
Just just a tiny bit.	O
I just feel like it just needs a little bit of push.	O
Alright, I'm gonna turn it off and on.	O
Yeah, and it doesn't look like I did anything to it, you know?	O
So I'm just going to go ahead and just going to move forward.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and export the variant.	O
Destination choose folder desktop because I'm an Uncouth Savage.	O
Uh, but I at least want to change the name.	O
And reset the counter.	O
OK.	O
Look at who knew that this was going to be the one I picked.	O
I would've had my family keep pushing photos for me.	O
So again, while this is going, don't forget guys that I do have a discord for makers, so if you guys are in love with making stuff or inspired by people who make stuff or.	O

RA maker yourself.	O
We would love you to join the discord.	O
Alright, so the first thing I'm going to do.	O
Is I'm going to duplicate the layer.	O
They don't want to make edits on the original, and I'm going to get my welcome tablet out.	O
Alright, so I need to.	O
We need to Retouch Alright Where is my oh isn't plugged in?	O
Alright, this is what happens.	O
I have quite literally limited USB connections.	O
Alright, so.	O
Alright, so there's mouse one.	O
Oh man, do I have to like?	O
It should work OK.	O
Cool Oh no.	O
All right, so we're going to zoom in and we're going to go ahead and start taking care of some of these unsightly sings.	O
Uh, an my favorite tool.	O
Is the heel tool and I will generally use that more than.	O
A lot of other things so you guys can definitely see the craftmanship over here is like stellar mean.	O
There's absolutely nothing wrong with this, of course.	O
I'm being absolutely for she's facetious.	O
Uh, and I have to make sure that there's no dog hairs 'cause I have a Â£100 Doberman who really likes to share.	O
Share things.	O
Mainly his fur.	O
So all these tiny little specs I'm cleaning, I also think I have some dead pixels happening.	O
Um on my camera, so whenever I see those dead pixels.	O
I definitely want to clean those up and the reason why I really like the so you have this stamp tool and you have the heel tool and the reason why I super love the.	O
He'll tool is because what it's doing is it's saying, oh, you want these pixels.	O
So notice that my cursor changes right?	O
So whenever I hold down option or alt, this like crosshair comes on right, and that's where I'm saying these are.	O
This is the source from where I want you to pick up the pixels alright, and then when it goes to a regular circle, that's where it's going to be actually applying them.	O
And what it does is that it reads the corresponding pixels around it, calculates the average of tonality in texture, and therefore ends up putting it in there.	O
Where if you end up doing a stamp tool.	O
So this is a really good place to do a stamp tool, because, uh.	O
You have a crease and granted I could do a clone tool here or he'll tool here if I really wanted to.	O
I mean, it works like fine for the most part.	O
But when it ends, it always ends up getting kind of Cray Cray.	O
So what I do is I like to do stamp tool.	O
And it will.	O
So whenever I end it.	O
It will be more firm.	O
And so I just I like that I like just how that hits a lot better.	O
Alright, so we need to go ahead and we need to fill this in so I'm going to go ahead and use the lasso tool by hitting Li.	O
Got my lasso and the things I've he run on the upper right hand corner or left hand corner of the program, which you guys probably can't see very well, which I'm I'm real sorry about all that that they have Pathfinder tools, so essentially you can union.	O
You can intersect you can difference your last so you can also feather it as well.	O
And so that's actually going to become really helpful if you end up making a mistake or something like this.	O
So like right here, if I zoom in, you can see that like I created this like line here.	O
That's not necessarily good, right?	O
Like, meaning like I, I didn't really want this upper right white in order to be there, so I'm going to go ahead.	O
I'm going to click subtract.	O
I'm also going to increase my father to one, largely because this is a very.	O
Blurry section.	O
And I'm going to subtract that.	O
And so there we go have decreased it even more so.	O
Now I'm going to do it even more.	O
Very cool and so now.	O
Now it's in there alright cool so I have one or two ways that I can fix this.	O

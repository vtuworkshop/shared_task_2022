I can either try to.	O
I hit S for my sample, I can.	O
Borrow these pixels.	O
And kind of come down.	O
Which seems to be working well and sometimes if it doesn't work well, I end up just digitally painting it.	O
And then adding a texture that recreates the paper grain and the camera noise.	O
It ends up working really, really well.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and do Apple D and you can see that there is definitely a sharp line between where I added the texture in or added the stamp and where I didn't and so that's where the Huell tool really shines, because anytime that I want to anytime where I want to blend and edge.	O
That is where the heel tool just comes in an work so beautifully.	O
So now you guys can see that's gone.	O
Alright so up here I want to just clean this up a little bit.	O
Now I want it to be a little bit harder.	O
Alright, cool.	O
Now we have.	O
I'm going to fix this whole bottom.	O
Actually, let's go ahead and blurred this.	O
Nope.	O
That's blur right there.	O
I'm just going to like just blur this line.	O
Just a tiny hair and we're going to have to definitely clean this bottom out or right quick, but.	O
I want to.	O
Alright, let's go ahead.	O
I'm going to in decrease my hardness 'cause I want that to be super soft and I'm going to kind of reduce my pasetti.	O
So at this point I'm just kind of like.	O
Just trying to blend things together really more than covering him.	O
Alright, and now we need to go ahead and start cleaning up some of these tabs.	O
OK, so this is where again, that clone tool is.	O
I don't know.	O
I always end up moving things on accident.	O
I don't mean to.	O
But it's like I get really happy with my.	O
And with my shortcuts, and I do things that I don't even know I'm doing.	O
Alright, and so quite literally all I'm doing.	O
Is kind of going over the edge.	O
And something that is really neat.	O
If you guys haven't noticed yet.	O
Whenever you're doing a clone tool.	O
It it always keeps the origination point.	O
Where if you do or the heel tool, if you end up doing a stamp.	O
This stamp is in actual approximation to your cursor, so if I say if I move my cursor an inch, my proximation will always stay there, see.	O
So my heel tool that that will always have the same origination point.	O
And what I really like about this is that if there is a texture or something that I really like.	O
On one part of the image I can quite literally just keep it there and keep applying it over and over and over again.	O
Alright, so we have some glue here that we need to to use.	O
Remember, for that I definitely really like my stamp tool, but I did change my settings to be less opaque.	O
So we want that to be solid now, so let's go ahead.	O
And this is papercraft, so frankly.	O
And this is not.	O
OK.	O
It's not perfect, I don't care.	O
'cause that is part of.	O
Part of it honestly.	O
Part of the charm.	O
Alright, and so once we're done.	O
I moved it again.	O
Once we're done, we're going to start coloring this bad boy.	O
'cause the color grading to me needs to definitely be fixed.	O
Alright, so we got this tab.	O
You guys know what I'm going to do.	O
I'm going to do.	O
He'll tool move fudge and I'll get it.	O
Definitely moved.	O
My cursor was like not where I wanted it to go.	O
So I'm going to want to keep small though, 'cause I want to.	O
And now that I see I gotta, I gotta keep within Ness or everything is going to get kind of weird.	O
And so now essentially what I'm doing is I'm just going and kind of around the radius.	O
You can see the movement of my brush by my cursor, but if it's easier to see it you can see it by the crosshairs and across her is just telling me where those pixels are being.	O
Um?	O
Generated from.	O
All right, and so you can still kind of see it.	O

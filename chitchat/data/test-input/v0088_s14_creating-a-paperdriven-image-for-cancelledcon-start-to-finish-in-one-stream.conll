And that's one of the things that is a good trick.	O
Whenever I'm working is like I like to zoom in and zoom out because that really helps me see things that perhaps I've missed.	O
All right, so let's go ahead and toggle.	O
So that's before and that's after.	O
Before Natcher, this would be a really good time to save 'cause we definitely don't want to lose.	O
Definitely don't know.	O
Loses cancelled con PSD.	O
OK, Alright and so because this is going to be kind of tricky, I'm going to go ahead and do some of the easier things.	O
Kind of as of warm up.	O
Alright, so I have this like white sand here.	O
It's largely because I have two children and open sand container.	O
And that's an has gotten everywhere of three children, so Isaiah two children had two children.	O
Yesterday they were playing with this and I guess is probably a better way to go about it.	O
Or say it alright is there?	O
Oh, there's a smudge over here.	O
As much over here.	O
All right?	O
OK, Alright cool so.	O
Let's tackle this.	O
Let's get some tea.	O
What kind of?	O
Figure out how we're going to tackle it.	O
OK, so.	O
I'm going to pin tool.	O
I'm wondering actually, OK?	O
Yeah, I'm going to pin tool.	O
So either.	O
I think what I need to do.	O
Is I need to kind of.	O
Clean that up like I shouldn't have.	O
Cover that up.	O
If this goes Ding, Ding Ding, Ding Ding.	O
Actually what I'll let me take a look at the original.	O
So the original had it going here.	O
Ah, you know what I'm realizing?	O
Actually, I liked.	O
That this was a.	O
Line here.	O
Like that?	O
And so while I added that I ended up 'cause I made that overlap on purpose.	O
And I lost that.	O
Fudge All right?	O
Good news is This is why I always have a second.	O
Alright, So what I'm going to do is that we're going to.	O
Make this selection.	O
Right click selection and we're going to do.	O
One pixel two pixels.	O
Two pixel feather.	O
And we're going to do invert that selection.	O
In a mask.	O
All right, and so now what's happening is that we're seeing the thing from below.	O
In that area, so I'm going to duplicate that layer.	O
And I am going to.	O
So instead of covering this up, I actually need to clean up this edge.	O
Yeah, clean up the edge and I think that that's going to work alright so but I'm going to do this.	O
Probably so.	O
Alright, so I'm going to apply this layer.	O
And I'm going to then merge these two.	O
Alright, so now I'm back to where it was.	O
But this was pretty much So what I did is I saved.	O
I saved all the previous retouching I did, except for this over here, which I will redo.	O
All right?	O
Alright, so that line should go.	O
I would imagine here to here.	O
All right, and you guys can see that.	O
Kinda messed it up a little bit I feel like.	O
It needs to go up and over some.	O
I don't know.	O
We have 45 minutes left.	O
I think we're going to be able to get this image done.	O
Which I'm pretty excited about, so I'm going to go ahead.	O
I need to add.	O
Or do I need to subtract?	O
I'm adding there.	O
Uh.	O
And I'm going to add there.	O

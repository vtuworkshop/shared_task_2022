Alright cool.	O
So now it's added alright sweet so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and clean out.	O
Best soups Ann.	O
I am using my.	O
I stamp tool.	O
And the reason why the reason why I'm doing my stamp tool?	O
Is because remember how I said that the huell tool did approximation?	O
Well, it also wants to not only doesn't want to do approximation.	O
It wants to.	O
Blended in.	O
All right?	O
I am getting.	O
All right, so this is what it is just going to do.	O
I'm going to digitally paint this and call a day, but I'm going to do it on another layer.	O
Anyway, the heel tool if you end up it does approximation, but once the blended in and so therefore it creates kind of like a gradient if you will.	O
Alright, so you guys can see all I'm doing is painting.	O
But I did on different layers 'cause I didn't want it to be destructive.	O
Because we need, we're going to need to add some texture to it.	O
In order for it to blend in.	O
And we're going to definitely need to reduce the flow down specifically over here, so we can like blend in a little bit more.	O
Definitely with digital painting.	O
It's just such a good idea to continually to source.	O
Um?	O
What you're doing, but also.	O
I like just blend it in.	O
And this is where welcome tablet is like a must have, because if you end up trying to do any of this.	O
Without a welcome tablet.	O
Just God bless your hands.	O
All right?	O
Alright, and so let's go ahead and go back to our stamp tool 'cause this edge right here we're going to need to carry over.	O
Oops.	O
We need to do that over here, don't we?	O
And I think I'm going to need to do that next.	O
Yeah, 'cause it's blending into the thing.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and undo that.	O
OK, sweet, so I mean, generally speaking this is looking good.	O
I need to just for a time just want to erase this edge right here.	O
'cause I'm wondering if I.	O
Got something over there all right, but I mean, generally speaking, this looks.	O
This looks good, so I'm just going to blend into edge alright and then I'm going to add this texture to it, which is the paper texture.	O
It's an action that I've already created.	O
And then do it again.	O
All right?	O
No, I didn't need to do it again.	O
Oh, and I didn't do it on the actual thing Fudge.	O
Man.	O
I am struggling.	O
Yeah, all right.	O
And then we need to erase over here.	O
All right?	O
And then now we are going to do select and we're going to merge those two.	O
Right now, with that done, we're going to go ahead and finish with.	O
No, it needs to be up a little bit higher.	O
Alright, this edge is going to be an interesting one to kind of figure out.	O
All right, So what?	O
What is going to happen with this edge?	O
So it definitely goes here.	O
And then does it turn?	O
But if it turns, it overlaps.	O
Does it go here?	O
Or do we need to move that over a little bit more?	O
Let's look at the original.	O
See I still think that.	O
Hum.	O
This is the fun part of like trying to figure out like, well, How do I re touch this to make it look the way that I want it to look?	O

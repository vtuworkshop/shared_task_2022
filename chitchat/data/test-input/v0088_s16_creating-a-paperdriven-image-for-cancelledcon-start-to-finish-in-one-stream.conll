'cause I can?	O
I don't think I like.	O
'cause if I do it there then that means that edge has to be there and the edge of the edges has to be there that impacts than the rest of the thing and that doesn't work.	O
So perhaps it was right all along.	O
That that's.	O
That's crazy, but the cool thing is that this is clean.	O
Ah.	O
So annoying, OK, so if it goes here.	O
And then that's the edge.	O
So then it would go straight down so straight down, Nope, straight down.	O
Straight down like that though, like that there you go and so now.	O
And I want to move this guy over here 'cause I don't want it to be.	O
So I think maybe that's what we need to do.	O
But we need to bring this guy.	O
It seems like we need to bring him.	O
Like so it would go here and that Greece would go here and they would meet up and they only grow straight down alright Yes, so Sean said Command Z is our friend and that is so true.	O
That is so true.	O
Alright so I'm going to go ahead and make selection selection again.	O
I'm going into my stamp tool.	O
And we're just going to finish this edge out.	O
Actually, let's let's hard this up a little bit, OK?	O
Oh, I'm at 100% OK.	O
And we're going to just go here.	O
I'm just going to meet up.	O
And then we're going to fill that in.	O
I haven't even fixed the rest of the stuff.	O
Alright, that definitely looks a lot better.	O
I don't think it's.	O
Perfect.	O
So let me get a smaller one.	O
I'm just going to kind of hand or Fudge.	O
So I need that to be soft and I need this to be so again, I'm going to kind of like low down my flow of my opacity in order to.	O
Get this.	O
Just kind of like.	O
Cover up a little bit.	O
Alright, so now we need to go ahead and start.	O
Fixing this stuff so I'm going to go ahead and increase.	O
My all my good stuff boom.	O
Boom And we're just going to start.	O
Boo.	O
We don't want to be that hard, hello.	O
I'm quite literally just going along the edge.	O
To fill in that space.	O
I mean, I don't mind some imperfection showing, so I'm not going to like.	O
Clear it out 100%.	O
But something that I've learned in photography is that if you want something to be cool, add fog and it's cooler.	O
It, no matter, no matter what it is, it could be a Unicorn.	O
Unicorns are pretty cool, but a Unicorn with fog.	O
Oh my gosh.	O
I want it to be more down.	O
Alright, so now that the retouching is somewhat done now, I'm not going to lie, I might end up doing some of this off camera just because Perfectionism and stuff.	O
But I don't want to spend all of our time retouching.	O
I quite literally has spent the most time retouching then like anything else.	O
Well, I take that back.	O
I think we did a good bit on the 3D rendering of all of this.	O
Let me just get this Gray is bothering me.	O
Granted, I know it's the Shannon all.	O
But still OK.	O
I'm going to lower this opacity down just so it's, oh, stop it.	O
Start moving, yes.	O
Silly animal.	O
All right, and we definitely get these like edges, and that's because it's counting vertices.	O

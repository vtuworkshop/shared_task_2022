Whenever I did the.	O
The tool or whenever I did blender I.	O
I I should have.	O
Gotten rid of the.	O
Stroke marks that created these vertices.	O
So it's not as smooth as some of the other circles that I've done.	O
But It's one of those things where you just kind of like gotta look at time.	O
OK Alright Cool Bamboo.	O
Alright let's play with color uh oh it's my favorite time OK cool so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to go to select color or selective color 'cause what I found is that even though I really do like after one and they have a really great tool to kind of create a uniformity of color and and so like if you have a background color like a background like paper.	O
And it's wrinkly and like whatever.	O
And you have some, like some weird textures to it, like the way that it can unify all of that really nicely.	O
It's just really awesome, but.	O
It doesn't really do a good job at like changing colors for you.	O
Alright, so right now I'm going to select my white and I'm going to.	O
I just want to clean up my whites, really.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go to set this as a select custom color and we're going to do white.	O
All right, and so now I know how off.	O
My White is.	O
Alright, I don't want to add yellow to it.	O
Thank you very much for green.	O
There we go.	O
Alright, let's toggle that on and off.	O
Very slight, I feel like the magentas there we go that helps.	O
Alright cool and so there we go.	O
what I can do though is that if I am feeling that that makes the fog Papa bit.	O
In the mask I can kind of just.	O
Oh well, my paint is like hardly anything.	O
I can paint that a little bit just to.	O
Just them not make it so bad.	O
Alright cool alright so now that we have that and I didn't really hit anything that was black so let's look at our Blacks.	O
The Blacks are looking pretty good.	O
I don't know if we need to like.	O
I'm going to add a little bit of blue in there.	O
A little magenta.	O
Now will keep the yellows I like.	O
I like the blue blocks.	O
All right, but I can definitely tell that I hit some of the fog with my black.	O
So I need to go back to my brush, hit my white 'cause I want.	O
Yeah, I want that show up alright cool so and I felt like I just made that a we dark.	O
So let's go back here and do zero Yeah Alright so again going to toggle on a Nov.	O
Yeah, it definitely like that.	O
Alright cool, so now the next thing that we're gonna play with is the Ritz Bar pop up on fire.	O
Oh alright.	O
So right here we are.	O
OK.	O
Looking at this it does feel a little bit too orangey to me, um.	O
So if I add a little blue.	O
I like how that kind of pops out on the right hand side.	O
That's nice.	O
No.	O
I think that might be it.	O
Adding the yellow makes it more coral.	O
Or Orange.	O
So we're going to keep it at that.	O
I don't know what if we did too.	O
No, that was 12.	O
Look at that.	O
That's crazy.	O
Definitely not the color that we wanted.	O
Yeah, not not digging all right.	O
And then what if we made it?	O
Uh oh away.	O
Bit Dhaka.	O
All right?	O
I think that looks good.	O
So now let's turn it of.-.	O
Turn it on.	O
It's just it feels a little bit more Chris.	O
I don't know if you guys are telling that like can really see like really slight change, but that is what's happening.	O

OK, cool.	O
And then the last thing in this.	O
Sometimes I don't have to do because I feel like I'm getting a little bit better with color so it's really not that needed, but sometimes whenever you're working with a whole bunch of different things and there are different colors this isn't.	O
This is literally three colors and one of them being white.	O
Hum.	O
But if I'm working with something that has a whole bunch of colors and like that, it just doesn't feel like it's jelling.	O
Well, uh, I will quite literally just put a photo filter over it, and I will.	O
Try they have a lot of different ones that you could try and you can also try the density as well, but you can also make a custom color too and and what it does is that it really kind of just makes the whole thing homogeneous a little bit more.	O
It makes him all kind of blend together a little bit, so I don't necessarily know if I would add a orange, but I might add a blue.	O
But I really don't like how it's impacting our white.	O
Normally I don't have a huge swath of white in my images.	O
I can tell you, though, I would really love it if that white could like be less.	O
Alright, I'm gonna I'm gonna see something really quick and I don't think this is going to I don't.	O
I don't think this is gonna work.	O
But we're going to do it anyway.	O
Alright, so I really like having my white clean.	O
Right?	O
So what if we select color range?	O
I wanted to select.	O
The White.	O
I select it.	O
Yeah.	O
I don't know, I just really like.	O
I mean, you can see that it's not.	O
It's definitely needs to.	O
Like clean it up right here.	O
But it just it feels so money and that's something that I see like specifically like wedding photographers.	O
They don't do very well is that they don't and I understand like you, I used to be a wedding photographer so I understand this.	O
But why pick up?	O
So much color.	O
Like it's ridiculous, alright?	O
I'm just going to pretty much.	O
And so when you are wearing wedding dress and it's outside your wedding dress is going to be blue.	O
In the pictures.	O
I mean, that's just that's what happens.	O
It reflects the Sky in absorbs.	O
Is I mean 'cause White reflects?	O
Um black absorbs.	O
Just, you know, a little.	O
Knowledge there for you and me.	O
What will end up happening?	O
Is.	O
What ends up happening is that it just.	O
It just doesn't look good.	O
It doesn't look persien, it looks muddied.	O
And so whenever I can.	O
Clean up my white.	O
I feel like it quite literally changes the dynamic of the photo.	O
And just looks cleaner.	O
But at the same time, it still reflecting, so you have to be really careful as to like where you're going to do it like.	O
So if I clean if I would say if I clean this.	O
Well, we'll just do it.	O
And see what happens.	O
'cause we have a little bit of time to spare.	O
Anything is is that like?	O
Even if you remove it all, I'm going to hard in this little bit, even if I remove it all I can always decrease the layer strength.	O
And add it back in slightly, but not to the full effect.	O
And so whenever I was a wedding photographer, uhm, I would always have them pick like their favorite 20 images or whatever.	O
And I would have them.	O
We definitely need the lasso tool on this.	O
So I would have them.	O

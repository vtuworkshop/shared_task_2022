Look at that.	O
I know I still need to do that, but I just I feel like it's a cleaner statement.	O
Than that.	O
And The thing is, is that if I want it to be back a little bit, I can tone it like that, which is probably what I'll do.	O
Just a just a little bit.	O
Anyway, I would have the couple.	O
You know, pick out there 20 photos or whatever.	O
And then those are the ones that would clean.	O
He don't do all like 100 or 200 or however many you're going to end up giving him back.	O
'cause that would be like horrific.	O
All right?	O
So definitely yet.	O
And we're almost done.	O
Just got to get that back part of the.	O
Back part of the saying, Yeah, Robert says I like the Gray tone.	O
Me too, I like it a lot better than this.	O
For reflection stuff.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and just.	O
Kind of.	O
I mean everything is kind of Polygon also kind of works really well with the lasso tool I just got to actually like.	O
Pick it up with the lasso tool.	O
Alright, enter and then I'm going to do the Pathfinder Union fi so I can get.	O
I can add to my selection.	O
Holy Moly.	O
Cool, alright, and now I'm just going to go ahead and fill that in with.	O
Uh, is it white or black?	O
His wife, Yes.	O
Forget.	O
Alright, I'm just going to clean it up a little bit.	O
Oh OK.	O
What is happening here?	O
I feel like I'm adding it back.	O
I don't know what's happening there.	O
Who that looks a lot better?	O
Alright, let's look at our original alright.	O
So that was our original.	O
Retouched?	O
With general colours tweet.	O
With the white crisp even good to see your friends.	O
Good to see you.	O
So Ethan is part of our discord makers place community.	O
And I met him at a conference.	O
Alright, so now I'm just going to go back and clean up.	O
Some of these places now again I want the Reds to reflect because I mean that is natural.	O
That is why.	O
Like it is natural, I think it'll look weird if we removed it altogether.	O
But we still want it to be pretty clean.	O
In general.	O
OK.	O
So again, just removing the like whites reflect light, but light is really friendly and that it will throw color.	O
So I had two know ahead.	O
3 lights on this and now it was surrounded by red so of course that red just jumbled all over the cancel Khan image.	O
Um?	O
And so in order to kind of clean that up and pop it out a little bit, we had to certainly.	O
Yeah, I don't understand why I do white over.	O
He ran it like it's revealing it.	O
I'm so confused.	O
I mean this is white, right?	O
Yeah.	O
And but if I do X.	O
Yeah, I'm like insanely confused as to like what's happening.	O
Oh Fudge Nugget.	O
It's just, it's just weird.	O
Oh now it's doing what it's supposed to do.	O
Little glitch in the system.	O
Adobe needs to drink a little bit more coffee.	O
Alright, so this is not a clean edge whatsoever, so let's go ahead.	O
I'm wondering, in my path a Ronis if I still have this election saved.	O
Oh booyah.	O
Alright, so I'm going to do is I'm going to.	O
Invert that wow, I did something invert.	O

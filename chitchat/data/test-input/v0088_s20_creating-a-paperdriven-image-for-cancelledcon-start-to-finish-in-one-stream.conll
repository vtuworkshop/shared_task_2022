Leaders leaders also called layers.	O
What in the world I want?	O
I just want to invert you.	O
Why is my invert not like working invert?	O
Oh because I'm adding a shift to it.	O
That is why.	O
I just inverted the whole entire mask instead of the.	O
What in the world?	O
Alright, let's undo all of this mess.	O
Alright, yeah, if I do that for some odd reason it's inverting not these selection but the mask and I have no idea.	O
What happened there and why it's doing that?	O
But this edge right here is.	O
Off the chain.	O
So we need to.	O
Clean that up for sure.	O
All right, and the rain give you.	O
Look at that.	O
Why is it your not but it's so annoying?	O
All right?	O
Anyway, we're going to go ahead and just clean this up.	O
OK, almost done.	O
I guess whenever I first painted this I didn't have a 100% opacity.	O
Brush 'cause I swear I did this already.	O
And I'm hitting the bracket like.	O
Just to change the size of my brush pretty quickly.	O
OK.	O
What filter using to remove the red tent up?	O
I am this is oops.	O
I am using.	O
I'm just in a Hue and saturation with the saturation all the way right all the way on the down low.	O
And I have it, I'm just playing around with the mask right now.	O
Is all I'm doing.	O
And The thing is, is that when you first start doing this, it's going to look really weird like it.	O
Like whenever I remove the red tent.	O
Now I have it on 70%, so that's actually so like what I'm saying is that it looks blue, like whenever you remove like a cast of color and it's just 100% grayscale like it looks actually kind of off.	O
But when you remove it and then you end up going back to 70 ends of throwing a little bit of that color in there.	O
So it feels like it feels like it's meant to be in that situation, 'cause we're used to those Kha zix, we're used to seeing that in real life, right?	O
But it can definitely just muddy up the image so so lessening it through pretty extreme extent.	O
I mean, I removed 70% of it.	O
Or yeah, I remove 70% of it, it just it just makes it cleaner.	O
OK, and I think the only other thing that I see really is kind of like this edge right here that I might want to just sharpen up a little bit.	O
A man I'm going to just do one more once over and then it's done and then you guys were with me.	O
For the entire T of.	O
I built it out in blender.	O
We cut it out.	O
We photographed it OK, granted I photographed it and then I showed you the images 'cause I did a lot of this stuff beforehand, which is which is the new take on the live stream for me.	O
Normally I just do everything on the live stream.	O
But today was the first time where I had different sections of the project complete, so we were able to get through one hole project together in 2 hours and I'm sure you guys really liked that a lot better.	O
Versus The counterpart OK.	O
I mean that that's about it.	O
I mean, there's there's little things that I see, but I think that's just because I'm looking at it.	O
But in the grand scheme of things.	O
This is what I'm going to give to Andrew.	O
So Andrew, if you're still on, this is what you're getting.	O
I hope you like it.	O
OK, so once again guys I didn't even get to talk to you about the schedule, so what's the schedule?	O
This schedule is that I am here every Tuesday and Thursday between 9:00 and 11:00 o'clock Eastern Time.	O

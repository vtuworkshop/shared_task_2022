We are actually in the middle of a Hearthstone card recreate and you guys are probably wondering like her stone card recreate.	O
What in the world is that will let me show you.	O
I gotta get back over here to the screen.	O
OK, So what I have been doing?	O
Tim, did you do?	O
Oh no, I don't want you guys just like No.	O
All right, So what I've been doing over here, you can guys can really see it here.	O
So her stone is a digital card playing game and I super love it.	O
And just like every card game, they have a front and back to each card.	O
The back has the artwork in the front has the mechanics of how to play the game and so the back of all these cards there's over 150 of them now they are just absolutely stunning in their beautiful.	O
So what I thought it would be really fun on this stream is like what if I recreated those things intangible objects because that is again what I do.	O
I'm a paper illustrator or a tactile illustrator.	O
I make things analog and then I end up making them digital again because why not.	O
So anyway, all of this was foam clay.	O
An lots of paint and this whole entire process was live streamed.	O
It was a 4.4 part live stream that if you guys want to look back in my past videos you guys can definitely see that.	O
So this one is called Blush room.	O
There is another one that I made called mark of her card.	O
So that one was clay.	O
This one is paper and sand and clay.	O
Also, just just really super cool, so we're currently making another one.	O
Uhm, which we haven't really made it very far into.	O
So if you guys want to come and join us, that's going to start back this coming this coming Thursday.	O
And if not, and you're here.	O
We might end up doing something else because you know what.	O
Who knows at this juncture, it could completely change 'cause I didn't know I was going to do this today until yesterday, so that's the nature of live stream.	O
But you know what will not change?	O
9:00 o'clock on Thursday I will be here creating something cool and I really, really, really would love for you to be with me.	O
So again guys, thank you so much for hanging out with me.	O
You definitely didn't have to, but I.	O

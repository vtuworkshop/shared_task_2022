Know well stocked badge if you only pick a couple of these options, we don't have a lot of stuff in your kitchen.	O
You really get the resourceful badge 'cause we're trying to keep a positive either way, so you're either going to be resourceful and they can do with what you've got, or you're going to be well prepared and making.	O
Gourmet deals in your fancy kitchen so.	O
Let's get started.	O
I have, uh, this plan like I said.	O
Of what I want this sortof unboarding to look like.	O
I know that I want to indicate in some way that you can swipe through these screens, which will I have this little.	O
A little bit here I'm I'm kind of thinking that these icons will sit on top of these plates, so like idea of like swiping through plates as the interaction.	O
And but the problem is that like these colors are going to work as they are currently because my icons are using this sort of.	O
Peach Peachy pink color.	O
So I'm going to have to think about that and then like the active and inactive states for each of these.	O
Icons uhm?	O
And he was really thinks that was the big things that take her son.	O
The layout.	O
Some of this stuff in our screens.	O
And if we want to have something sort of in the beginning, we'll see where we get to.	O
We'll see.	O
We'll see how far we get to today.	O
So That being said.	O
I'm gonna start putting in some of my home start thinking about what kind of questions I want to phrase questions.	O
So, uh, what's up chat happening?	O
Who stop by?	O
Let's see you how are you doing?	O
I'm not, I'm not let me know if I'm pronouncing your name correctly.	O
Nice to see you.	O
Corey is saying maybe the plates had just have the title on it and the icons are in the white space below.	O
Now that's a really good idea is maybe we can have just the sort of questions or the.	O
Um statements are recorded at the top be over top of the plate and then that leaves a lot of room for icons.	O
We went up to worry so much about the colour contrast so maybe will go that route.	O
Let's see how it looks.	O
So if I.	O
Both of these guys up when I get to swap the order of elements here.	O
Excellent thing we need to be all the way up.	O
And there's no logo, I believe only little bit below.	O
Sounds like when it be careful of the top, Apple has the notch at the top of the devices, so we don't want to put them directly over top.	O
So I'm gonna just going by layers, new folders in front.	O
Not for center in nature.	O
What everything is centered on my boy here we know if you have any questions about what I'm doing about XD about life in general and I will do my best against them.	O
Jennifer pools here.	O
Hello Jennifer, how you doing?	O
Who suffer thank you.	O
Just work, work, work.	O
Yeah I feel that I am so I.	O
My goal for this weekend was to try and get through 'cause I had Friday off is trying like get through an update.	O
A lot of my projects that we've got.	O
Unless you need him on a vehicle with that so.	O
I'm wondering if this should be like kitchen appliances like.	O
Like a like a.	O
Like a title or if these should be like questions that we're asking somebody.	O
Like what?	O
What appliances you have in your kitchen or something like that?	O
We know we like it.	O
Better is like a.	O
Question order.	O
You have I'm gonna change this to our area type.	O
I'm not too concerned about feedback and swing over if we do longer blocks like this might have to consider doing.	O
A different font.	O
Instead, I'm concerned about the.	O
Uh.	O
Legibility of this kind of fun fun here at.	O
Hum.	O
Yeah, let me know what you think.	O
We know if we should.	O
Do that or not.	O
Corey is saying definitely the question option, OK?	O
I'm doing fine avoiding my latest illustrated piece, a squid.	O

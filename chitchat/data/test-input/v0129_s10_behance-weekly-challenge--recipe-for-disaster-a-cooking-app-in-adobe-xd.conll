You follow logic.	O
Syntax is experience based logic.	O
So in terms of the.	O
Order questions for his onboarding experience.	O
I was I'm trying to group them.	O
It may make more sense, I guess in this case to do.	O
Reverse these two days.	O
I might do I might put what tools are in your kitchen.	O
And then, um.	O
How many people are you looking for and then guide her restrictions?	O
Because I'm trying to go from like equipment down too.	O
So we're starting with appliances to tools, to people, to specific stuff people.	O
So I guess I'm going from.	O
Why your large select appliances are larger than tools?	O
And that's probably the most important step in determining the user profile is you're going to want to.	O
I mean, you want to know people got stoves and stuff like that.	O
I don't know.	O
It's a mixture of code, finisher of like logical.	O
Progression so trying to keep the.	O
Common elements organized or like into groups together and also just.	O
Experience based I guess I don't know.	O
What feels right?	O
So I I feel like leading with the appliances.	O
Also it yeah this is just the.	O
A combination of things.	O
Love.	O
Say about fashion course and everything.	O
The water jacket.	O
Yeah, I think that makes more sense.	O
I thought it and then I I didn't make the change that.	O
So that means that the next one is going to be our table, which we're going to be like out here.	O
Open document, like I said, I'm probably.	O
Going to set them up on this, but then I'm going to greet them with the.	O
This elements that we can slide to drag to slide over.	O
Things.	O
These these icons and this are going to slide over and this is going to change from this dot highlighted to evil not highlighting.	O
But I want to actually see I'm doing, which is why I'm doing all of this stuff on this screen here.	O
Mostly dry tie down select.	O
So.	O
Yeah.	O
Thing about actually copy wanted to run the store.	O
Not people from line.	O
So and then saying is the background music, 2 hours in the afternoon.	O
Let me know the.	O
You know that is any better.	O
You know that any better?	O
Before.	O
Hold your peace guys.	O
Moving again, concerning your putting the two groups.	O
And I'm going to.	O
Who order this mess that illustrator setup?	O
Who won the best?	O
What's wrong with the bottom?	O
We actually get a copy or one from the last screen so that we don't need to make it twice.	O
Same.	O
Seymour, we did here.	O
For this one, I'm saying this overtime.	O
Honestly.	O
So.	O
How, how long is saying?	O
Got it, I guess I'm trying to figure out navigation best practices.	O
Of course, the combination ordering techniques have a problem navigation right now in a project on I am contributing, so I would look into information architecture best practices because my it is a mixture of link.	O

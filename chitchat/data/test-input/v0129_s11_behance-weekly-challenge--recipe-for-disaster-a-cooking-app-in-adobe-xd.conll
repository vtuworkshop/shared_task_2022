It's also depending on the context that you're making the work for.	O
Like what's going to be the best.	O
A way to organize your navigation items so it really just.	O
It's really just a matter of like what makes sense for your audience.	O
There's a couple of different exercises you can.	O
Go through, uh, one of which is to just like.	O
Write down all of the.	O
Current navigation you're working with.	O
Like all the current navigation items on the like little post it notes and stick them up on a wall essentially, and sort of really arrange them and try to reorganize into so that they flow in like a more consistent way.	O
Or like like more consistent way that you like better.	O
At 9:00 Screen against so.	O
We go.	O
Back to my.	O
Enjoy can hear.	O
You can see that that's basically what I start with, and I'm working on the project is.	O
I start with the order of elements.	O
I love groups.	O
Essentially this is like a.	O
You call user journey cholita information architecture like thinking about all of this stuff.	O
Uh, the user needs to navigate through and how they are all connected, and that's how it started by projects is not with like drawings of what interface is going to look like, but what is the stuff that I need to put in?	O
He ran like how does it get organized?	O
How does somebody navigate through all of that stuff essentially so?	O
It starts out like this, and usually if we're more complex things, well.	O
If I go back you can see the.	O
This is the same book that I did the Taco apps designs for.	O
So if I go back up here, this is where the Taco app started and you can see there's a lot of overlap.	O
There's arrows and stuff drawn to tie together these reflections and then for the timer app.	O
I went through and.	O
Road out drug screens, but I still there's a lot of like notes and then there's like one A1B1C like instructions about just sort of how I think all of this is going to link together and that can change from here to here to a final.	O
But yeah, let's just go.	O
Nothing helps you at all.	O
But yeah, I would look into information architecture best practices, just kind of.	O
Go from there.	O
It also just use speaker.	O
You know your own experience as a user, like what sort of like nobody wants to have to sit through.	O
A lot of information, which is what Michael was.	O
For this I'm trying to give like the basic sort of.	O
Kitchen items that you would need to uhm.	O
Do.	O
Cook in the kitchen like you're probably going to pots and pans.	O
Probably need a chefs knife and I'm trying to go from there and say like this is this is sort of.	O
A simplified list of things and if you want to add that's just add other at this ad other button.	O
When I'm thinking how that would work is similar to the search for ingredients sort of at the beginning of the app that we talked about.	O
So having just you could have had other and it's going to give you a box, but you can add like.	O
Uh oh, I also have a potato ricer.	O
Uh, in my kitchen.	O
Or uhm, you know I have a loaf pan in my kitchen or I have, you know, these other things that you might might be important.	O
L you know important things in certain recipes, but uhm.	O
The average user might not want to go in and like look at a huge list of all of those things and like be over choice, choice, paralysis kind of thing like I don't want to go through and like Check all these boxes you know.	O
So I try to keep it simple.	O
But also we've run for.	O
Users too.	O
As their own.	O

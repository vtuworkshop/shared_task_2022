Another thing is all kind of recap in the secondary numbers in and everything going, but depending on where.	O
The number of options that you think you'll either get.	O
Sort of an screen that sounds like it gives you a little like badge thing.	O
It seems like prepared or well stocked 'cause you got all you selected.	O
A lot of you've got a lot of cooking equipment.	O
And everything, or it will, if you are, you know.	O
I checked, few options will say, you know resourceful and will call the something cute art for that.	O
So.	O
That is the plan.	O
So do you wanna overview of everything or something?	O

We are almost through.	O
Almost states really made of the state.	O
Who?	O
You know she here last number.	O
Bad, so um.	O

So for our for the check for this thing we are making.	O
A cooking app and.	O
We're making so for the.	O
For today, we're working on the on boarding for this, but the idea is cooking out is that somebody would.	O
A user would start using it when you open it up, and it would ask you these questions, what appliances do you have in your kitchen?	O
What tools you have in your kitchen?	O
How many people are you cooking for, and are there any dietary restrictions or allergies?	O
And so here are all of the different icons we have for these.	O
Different scenarios sort of things.	O
And you kind of rearrange these so it makes more sense.	O
I tried to come up with sort of the basic Kitchin Appliances and tools that somebody might have in the kitchen, so so blender anuj would be once you go through an we have so far is turn turn these on and off.	O
To indicate that you have those items or not.	O
And you can see that I'm using this sort of plate motif for these to show that to indicate that the user can swipe to get to the next screen for the on boarding by using a little hint indicator there, and the idea is that.	O
This is sort of an expandable idea, so these are sort of the basics that there's this ad other category where you would be able to type in if you had, like if you have a a rice cooker or you own a deep fryer, or you know different tools that you might have because the idea of this app is that the Main.	O
Search functionality of it is that you open up this app you created a user profile.	O
If you're importing, that tells the app like these are the basic.	O
You know the basic information about my visa to layout my kitchen.	O
This number if you go looking for etc.	O
When you open this app will just be greeted with basically a search bar.	O
Yeah, when you type in the ingredients that you have so you.	O
Come squirting Stingrays what you got on hand so we've got the.	O
You be able to type in like.	O
Chick in and hit enter and it'll add underneath your search box like a little tag box.	O
You're basically adding ingredients.	O
You can add one ingredient, or you can add, you know, as many as was based on the number of ingredients that you add and the choices that you made in your.	O
On boarding here on what tools you have in your kitchen, it will pull recipes for you.	O
So you'll say like I have.	O
I have a box of stale cereal and baloney and it will pull recipes that are tagged with those items.	O
Open your search so it's really, really straightforward simple.	O
Recipe search that's just focusing on what you have, what tools you have in the kitchen, what ingredients you have in your kitchen, and you can pull up recipes that way so.	O

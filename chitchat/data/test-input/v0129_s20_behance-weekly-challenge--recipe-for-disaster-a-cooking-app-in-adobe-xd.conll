And it's you know it's made for, uh, the simple, like.	O
The Amish Cook that's got like the minimum kind of stuff in their kitchen all the way up to like it can be expanded.	O
With this ad other, to add additional items, but I wanted a onboarding that wasn't going to be overwhelming for someone who doesn't like you don't want to look at a list of a million options, right?	O
So I try to keep it simple since they like.	O
So for people who don't have, uh.	O
Who are you know, professional chefs and don't have a kitchen full of equipment.	O
You know you can just.	O
Um, stick with this basic kinda list of stuff and check on it off what you have or you don't have.	O
Or you can get really really in depth and Add all the other tools in the kitchen.	O
That's just adding more tags into your search so when you're searching it's saying like I'm also going to look for recipes that have that have deep fryers.	O
I'm also going to look for recipes that have a loaf pan you may not necessarily.	O
Um?	O
Yes, you may not necessarily need that level of detail, but it's expandable for Chester.	O
Have a lot of stuff in your kitchen, and people who don't, so I don't know if that makes sense.	O
That's basically the rundown of this whole.	O
What are you doing?	O
So we're kind of adding all of these into this master sort of screen here so that we can do the dread.	O
Dragon.	O
So so.	O
You can see that I've got like this master.	O
Yeah.	O
Lift Master.	O
Group here of all of our stuff.	O
I don't know, so it goes a little bit outside of maybe the bounds of the.	O
Original.	O
Challenge but.	O
Now you see.	O
I don't have a copy of the components and he actually.	O
Good for you, alright?	O
Do you love him?	O
Mostly going to reset this back to the initial state so it's not all the way up to 9 right now, sorry.	O
Default state, so backwards era.	O
I feel like the last one we have to worry about is just setting up these.	O
I can't hear anything.	O
Move on.	O
OK.	O
Thanks.	O
I guess I should probably clarify that I had already done.	O
Back in March, all the way through May, I'd already done a series of patterns.	O
So I didn't really want to do the.	O
Um badge thing again since I already done it before, so I wanted to do something a little bit different, which is sort of weird.	O
I tried that with this idea.	O
It took me awhile.	O
I only came up with it this morning and it took me awhile to get to this point, but.	O
Yeah.	O
And again, we're going to use the same ad other here so we don't have to make 3 invent the wheel.	O
With this icon.	O
Yes, this is war world.	O
I've replaced.	O
So the idea here this screen for example, is that you would be able to select.	O
Add add.	O
More than you would be able to add additional like theology to be able to add like.	O
I'm also allergic to shellfish or I can't have.	O

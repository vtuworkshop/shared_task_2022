Would animal box that you could basically like it next week.	O
Or you could type and add another one.	O
So basically just making this list of ingredients that you want to search by and you would be able to search and it would pull up recipes that use those ingredients.	O
Basically whatever you have on hand and your user profile, which is what your kitchen is like and it would pull recipes that have that kind of stuff so.	O
What is he?	O
That's not working on.	O
And I'm putting together the on boarding.	O
Sequence of events here.	O
Just kind of finishing it out actually.	O
And then we're going to put a drag trigger for.	O
Power.	O
Springs.	O
Somebody would go through.	O
So we can add, basically, uh.	O
The theme of this very same team is the theme of the we U stream challenges to his quarantine awards and so at the end of our onboarding here we're going to add a.	O
Depending on.	O
What you the options that you chose?	O
You are you are going to have its either gonna.	O
You're either going to get it like an ending screen, an end screen for this on board, and that gives you like a.	O
Uh, two different badges, or just sort of screens, one of which is going to be prepared or well stocked.	O
You guys let me know what sort of language it should be.	O
Basically, if you picked a lot of these options like you have all of these tools, then it's going to give you the well stocked or prepared badge, and then if you only have a couple of tools like you only have, you don't have to even microwave an you have, you know a chefs knife.	O
It's gonna give you the resourceful because you're going to have to do this full so.	O
Sounds my thought that you have to do it option.	O
Maybe video either be the resourceful shaft or you be the welfare check so.	O
Nothing wrong with either option.	O
Alright so I'm gonna make another group here and we're going to.	O
Move this on over and add it you are.	O
Massive.	O
Set up.	O
I probably have.	O
This one is gonna go underneath hour.	O
Wow.	O
Any dietary restrictions?	O
So the idea was this is like I said, I picked sort of.	O
The minimum sort of components that you would need in the kitchen to cook essentially are trying to come up with, like the most basic sort of stuff, things that people a lot of people have in their kitchen, so, but there's an add other, so the idea is that like if you are a new Oregon experienced cook, you might not have a, you know.	O
Even why you might not have a ton of equipment, or you might just want to.	O
I try to keep this fairly, not overwhelming to look at.	O
Essentially, it was my goal is to not have every single piece of kitchen equipment and kitchen appliance than you could possibly imagine in this list because I felt like it would be really overwhelming to the user.	O
And so I wanted something that would be.	O
Approachable to, uh, uh, everybody?	O
No matter this cooking skill level, but also adaptable to.	O
The professional chef for the person that has a lot of equipment or wants to add a lot of stuff to their list essentially so there's this ad other if you want to add in every single one of these categories, just add other options, and that's a place where we take you to again, I'll sort of search field or text box input box where you could put in any additional things you might have.	O
New kitchen so you can add a rice cooker.	O
You can add a little pen you could add.	O
A potato rates are all these other things you might have in your kitchen, but you you don't have to you.	O
You could just stick to these basic sort of things, but I wanted to have the option there.	O
Something wanted to add it if they wanted to go really in depth with this and this all kind of is accessible from the user profiles anytime so they can change and make updates as they go.	O

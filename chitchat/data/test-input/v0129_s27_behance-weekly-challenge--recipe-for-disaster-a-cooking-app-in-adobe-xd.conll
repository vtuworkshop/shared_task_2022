We did get this far.	O
I have to.	O
I knew that this is probably going to eat up.	O
More than two hours to get through, but it's OK if you got pretty good.	O
Uh.	O
Start on everything I need to go back here you can see it as far as starting to think about the search page and and that everything I've gotta go back and I've got at the branding in.	O
You know, if you guys like any of these sort of ideas of playing with.	O
And I need to add to.	O
Screens for.	O
Um?	O
Prepared or this wistful so?	O

He continued to work on this and get through everything.	O
But every guys had fun.	O
I may have been a little overly ambitious.	O
Like I said earlier in this sort of app idea, but I wanted to do something a little bit different and I had already done so.	O
Sort of social distance.	O
Paget social distancing merit badges.	O
I think the name that project so I wanted to do something a little bit different and I definitely wanted to do some new UI UX work, so this seems like a fun place.	O
Take this challenge.	O
Yeah, I've gotta just I don't have too much more work to do I mean, really, if I wanted to, I could just put do the badges at the end here and be done, but I do want to do something fun with the beginning and logo.	O
All that sort of stuff, and then the search is pretty simple, even if I don't get a wired a prototype working of it.	O
It might be nice just to show sort of my thoughts on how it would work, especially since it ties into how the it's going to basically behave and look the same as the option to add other sort of equipment and stuff like that.	O
It would just I really have in my head like this, very minimal.	O
Interface which is not trying to show like keeping everything very clean and very simple.	O
Like I said, I'm my goal is just kind of Appeal to kind of the wide range of.	O
The audience you know that might be using a recipe app.	O
Like this where you are focused on what resources you have and how to utilize them.	O
That's really, that's really.	O
The goal here is like what, what?	O
What's your kitchen setup want equipment?	O
Do you have in the search will just be what ingredients you have.	O

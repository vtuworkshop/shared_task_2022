What do we think?	O
I didn't even I don't.	O
I was planning on doing a body today, but we're doing ahead I guess.	O
Yeah.	O
Oh hey, call me good morning.	O
How are you?	O
Welcome to the stream.	O
Nice to see you.	O
OK, so I'm going to move to my clay buildup tool.	O
Um?	O
We're going to see how we're going to see how this goes.	O
Please let me know if the audio sounds different.	O
I keep its hard 'cause I I listen to Spotify but the settings are going to be different when I stream then when I listen to it casually so.	O
Hum.	O
You know?	O
Give me a moment I had notes out for Z brush specifically and I want to kind of break them out because is still.	O
A new movie with this program.	O
And I would much rather have my safety blanket.	O
Then not.	O
I was like I knew I was streaming this morning, but you know, those days where you just like do not feel prepared.	O
Man, one of those days is fine.	O
So I don't need this image.	O
Blue eyes it's gonna look weird for awhile.	O
That's how it always goes.	O
OK.	O
That Look too low though.	O
I think that would slow slightly too low.	O
Digging in to the school to make eye sockets.	O
And.	O
Maybe we'll just make a school today.	O
I wanted to make a face, but there's.	O
It's a whole thing to create eyelids and.	O
And stuff, and I'm still kind of.	O
I always have trouble too with the audio to be honest.	O
Yeah for real I am.	O
I'm getting a headset tomorrow and I'm really hoping that fixes all of my audio issues 'cause as of right now, if you're hearing music, I can't hear anything, so it's like I'm just like in a quiet room just talking because I had my music set up where it streams, but it like goes through the stream.	O
An I can't figure it out to where I can hear it too so.	O
I've never used the brush so it's cool to see how it works.	O
Yeah, I'm I'm definitely new to it, but there's actually a link in the description.	O
Z brush has or pixologic has a free Z brush.	O
Trial should definitely check it out.	O
Might as well.	O
I mean, that's exactly what I'm doing it just.	O
I really wanted to make 3D art and I was like why don't I and?	O
So I have a little.	O
Free trial right now.	O
It's a, It's a lot of fun.	O
It's so much fun.	O
I gotta gotta 100% be honest, it is.	O
So much fun.	O
Really like creating it.	O
Definitely.	O
Still a beginner.	O
And.	O
So in this shift.	O
Hum.	O
I want us.	O
Subdivide my mesh so we're going to press control D.	O
Wow, that really to say OK.	O
And so how schools usually work is that your job portion is going to be.	O
Separated like your upper John, your lower jar actually separated and there's like gaps in between for your muscles and ligaments and nerves, and things like that.	O
And the last time I tried sculpting.	O
A soul, it didn't quite turn out how I wanted with the gaps, so I'm going to try something different today.	O
I'm not sure if it's going to work.	O
But we're going to try it.	O
That's the whole point of learning so.	O

Really.	O
Get where I'm going for it.	O
Need to find broadridge at these big, beautiful cheekbones.	O
I just wanna make sure I'm doing.	O
Is such a good reference?	O
3D model, that's why it's OK, OK?	O
Um, hi Sam.	O
How are you Good afternoon?	O
How's your Sunday been so far?	O
She's gonna.	O
Do you like this?	O

So I.	O
The plans a little everything.	O
I'm gonna dig more into the eye sockets.	O
Um?	O
Honestly, I think it's more fun to sculpt us goal than it is to paint one, because I feel like I really get to understand like all the nooks and crannies.	O
Of like the head, I don't know if if that makes sense.	O

That line is too.	O
Hello.	O
Album But I'm very excited about tomorrow 'cause my headsets coming in gotta collapsed ring with Nathaniel Alice check amount in that chat.	O
He's really talented 3D artist.	O
We're going to be streaming on my page tomorrow.	O
Pencil 2D arc which is going to be pretty fun.	O
So feel free to follow and you'll be notified when I go like tomorrow.	O
Still not looking exactly.	O
Troy wanted to not sure why.	O
I think.	O
My eye sockets are upturned.	O

This corner here.	O
Needs to come down a little bit.	O
OK, so it's actually.	O
Dinner here and then it comes out like, at least with this reference, the time.	O

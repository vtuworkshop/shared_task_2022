Awesome, I'm in Fort Collins staying with friends of the summary.	O
I'm not surprised it rained the whole time.	O
Yeah, it's a.	O
It's really weird 'cause I feel like Colorado gets most of its rain in the summer.	O
I don't know 'cause it snowing in the winter.	O
At least where I am, there's a lot of 'em.	O
A lot of rain in the summer.	O
I gotta I gotta race this mass.	O
Control click drag background OK.	O

He My mouse is not cooperating.	O
So I'm just going to solve it.	O
I think.	O
I think that's probably for the best.	O
Open eagled enough where.	O
No, I'm not.	O
I'm I'm not progressing.	O
I gotta progress in some other way.	O
I'm just like.	O
And there is a document down below in the description with all of the zebra shortcuts.	O
If you are considering trying that.	O
See brush free trial which you should 'cause it's free 'cause why not?	O
Yeah, definitely check out the document.	O
Also because at least for me, I'm mainly working photo shop.	O
You know that's a That's kind of my jam and I'm kind of used to a certain UI.	O
And personally, for me the UI has been the hardest thing for me to learn with this program.	O
That's like insert my Alpha incident.	O
She's Malka.	O
Sorry.	O
Got distracted but yeah, definitely check out the document.	O
the UI is super confusing.	O
Hum.	O
And Yeah, it will save your life for real 'cause what I did I didn't know about the document and then I like went into a tutorial and then wrote down all of the shortcuts and they have it written out for him.	O
They have it taken care of, so don't be like me, don't.	O
Don't write notes in it tutorial.	O
They have it all for you.	O
I could not believe I did that I would.	O
I found the document after I had done it was like Are you kidding me?	O
I could not believe that I would do that.	O
It was really funny.	O
I think it's funny.	O
He's trying to create that.	O
Um?	O
For.	O
Upper jaw kind of portion.	O
What I'm seeing with skulls at least.	O
And you know.	O
How how it looks on your face is going to be different than how your skull loves because we got like flesh and muscle and nerves and tissue.	O
You know all that good good stuff on your face.	O
But like for your actual like.	O
They're kind of.	O
It's like I would assume a lot of people think they like sit straight in your job, but they're actually more like rounded a little bit.	O
I don't know if if articulating myself properties, but.	O
Yeah, So what we're trying to do is make sure we're creating.	O
And we have to keep tracking our side profile 'cause That's important with that.	O
Now, I'm actually probably going to move to my clay tool, I think.	O
And I'm forgetting the shortcut for it, but thankfully it's right up here.	O
Um?	O
A little bump.	O
For a minute.	O
See this.	O
This app.	O
Um also.	O
If you are going to be.	O
Playing around with Z brush I would really look into Alphas.	O
If you check here on the left hand side.	O
Sorry, there's gonna be all these different types of Alphas that you can use in that kind of just like also changes the texture of your brush so you have like let's say the clay tool which kind of builds up your model and then you can kind of add a texture on top of that.	O
At least it's like my understanding of it again.	O
I'm a beginner so so don't put too much taking what I'm saying, but that's my understanding in what I've what I've been doing, so I've been using A6 'cause it kind of smooths everything out a little bit.	O

But it looks like to me.	O
So and also one of professional is using the A6.	O
Besides was like.	O
Well if he's using.	O
But yeah, so.	O
I'm going to get more into this kind of phone and Temple area.	O
I think that probably.	O
I have a tendency to neglect my side profile so.	O
When it comes in pretty thin, it looks like according to my room.	O
How to check the chat?	O
I'm going to try Z brush when I get the chance.	O
Definitely definitely I'll call me.	O
Thanks for joining up.	O
It was nice seeing you think so otherwise.	O
See you later.	O
So nice.	O
Yeah, a Kobe is a fellow streamer.	O
I keep probably already left, but go check him out, um.	O
I think he does.	O
Graphic design, if I'm not mistaken.	O
I think I've only hopped into one of the string, so please forgive me, but he's very talented.	O
Looks like he does.	O
And then essentially, yeah, good check amount.	O
This could be.	O
Clatus, I think that's how you pronounce it.	O
Definitely check him out.	O
So we're going to build up this cheap phone.	O
Sorry, it's also unlike trying to have my reference open and I downloaded this thing called pure ref.	O
But I just didn't think to get it set up before string today, but it's apparently in supposed to make it really easy to have your references out.	O
OK.	O
So.	O
This kind of coming.	O
Far back And this is kind of indented here.	O
For example, is.	O
Yeah.	O
Turns out a little bit here.	O
He comes into.	O
That Please.	O
Destroyed.	O
Sing for me.	O
Hum.	O
No.	O
So.	O
Phones are weird.	O
We're gonna.	O
Oh no.	O
All this in.	O
Start creating.	O
They have a.	O
Upper jaw here.	O
Interest smooth this out.	O
Because.	O
They have a tendency to with.	O
So how you paint into the and how your sculpting in 3D is going to be different with your stroke patterns?	O
I think, especially with like let's say.	O
Depending on what you're doing into these, you can kind of scribble a little bit, but with sculpting had to be a little bit more mindful of like where you're putting down your strokes, 'cause I can change the the model, make it look lumpy.	O
If you're if you're not being careful.	O
So like, let's say if I was just kind of like scribbling like this, you know it's like that's weird looking.	O
But if you kind of do something like this where it's more of like a up and down or vertical stroke, we think they'll have an easier time.	O
Building up and.	O
Creating the look.	O

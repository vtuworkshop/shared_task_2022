It fills in less, but.	O
This thing is that.	O
He needs.	O
Do you have an idea of?	O
Don't make this nose look right.	O
It's like so I'm I'm carving out right?	O
But then if I try to smooth it just fills it back in.	O
Is it because there's just not enough polygons in there?	O
Is that she's like freaking out.	O
I need to like.	O
Do some do some math, sub dividing or.	O
Something else.	O
Big stretch.	O
And streaming for about an hour and then keep going, but.	O
Sometimes just got stretch it out.	O
Let's So.	O
And then I've been procrastinating making teeth.	O
I gotta be 100% honest.	O
I'm nervous about making tea.	O
Thinking.	O
It might.	O
It might be worth.	O
Doing Play tool.	O
You should subscribe, I just I don't know.	O
Maybe maybe it's just me.	O
I like the low Polygon.	O
Like I don't mind this look, I don't.	O
I get it.	O
I get it.	O
I need a sensor.	O
Let me get it.	O
I'm just feel like the nose just like.	O
And all of Maine details that I mean, just like kind of disappear when I do that.	O
But maybe I should have just subdivided in multiple times and then work done like details.	O
Maybe that's the real answer here.	O
But so far.	O
So good I think.	O
I guess we're going to move on to the clay tool and see if I can make seeds.	O
I have no idea.	O
How this is gonna go down, but thankfully I'm not making like a model to like actually talk.	O
This is just a sculpt so I don't have to worry about.	O
Um?	O
And no, it actually could be looking good.	O
I'm.	O
I don't know.	O
Guys.	O
Yeah.	O
I'm still learning.	O
Make a man.	O
I.	O
What, oh?	O
As a way to for me.	O
OK.	O
First off, get rid of.	O
I don't know guys.	O
I just don't know.	O
I think I'm gonna have to.	O
I'm doing, I'm doing things I'm not supposed to.	O
These are a front seat.	O
Great.	O
And then I'm probably going to get out my trim dynamic and then maybe try to flatten them to create more of A.	O
That tooth texture I I'm not feeling confident the team I know at least for painting.	O
It's like one of those things that's really.	O
Difficult.	O
So.	O
I'm not liking the looks of these.	O
Don't forget, when you subdivide you can still switch down to the lower subdivision layers each up and down.	O

OK then.	O
Gonna be a little bit of a break on the side of the space here.	O
I'm not even checking the chat, I'm sorry, I'm just looking at the.	O
The teeth are looking clean.	O
I just came out of my from my dental hygienist thing actually.	O
Uhm sticky, but with, uh, the teeth.	O
It seems that a lot of people who do 3D modeling, actually individually modeled the teeth and then stick 'em in there.	O
I'm still learning, so I don't wanna do that yet, so I really I really appreciate the compliment, I.	O
I'm working.	O
It's not exactly how I want it to look, yet with the teeth in particular, but I feel like we all know as artists, that teeth are a little bit.	O
Hard to do sometimes.	O
So I want to get the.	O
What is this?	O
It was like a crack right here, but I'm not seeing the name.	O
There's a lot of words here and I've.	O
We have the AC it.	O
I should have taken anatomy, guys, that's that's really good.	O
I can't see any of your words.	O
Got the site zygomatic bone, we got the temporal process.	O
We got the maxilla.	O
The maxilla I don't.	O
I don't really know what I'm even saying.	O
Just looking at it.	O
References.	O
I don't know.	O
I don't know guys.	O
Really, I think I really don't know.	O
So.	O
More cracks I don't know, I just I just want to add more texture on here.	O
It's not necessarily for the the plates for the skull, but I do want a little bit more texture.	O
Kind of up in here a little bit.	O

I don't know.	O
So it's going to be.	O
Dude.	O
Straight up in here.	O
We don't even have like an actual like real.	O
We haven't really worked on the back of this, so it's probably for the best that we do a little bit something with it.	O
Well, that's just completely that's to the neck then.	O

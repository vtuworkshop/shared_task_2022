I have arrived.	O
I apologize if my microphone is very loud.	O
It doesn't like it's a little loud.	O
Can let me fix that really fast.	O
There we go.	O
Hopefully that is a little bit better.	O
It is like 89 degrees in my room right now.	O
And so I have like a fan blowing directly on me and my microphone is right here, so it's kind of in the same direction.	O
There we go, hopefully that'll help a little better, but I've got some snacks.	O
I've got a delicious Mogu Mogu drink.	O
Baby coconut bits in it weirdly delicious and we're going to do some artsy fartsy stuff because, oh.	O
This dog.	O
That was from, uh, it's a little weird way to open up a song, but that's from Princess Monon.	O
OK, I don't realize I just didn't have my tablet plugged in like a theme song.	O
Let's see where is it?	O
Had lunch earlier in here and I don't like having my food resting on top of my tablet.	O
I don't have the finances to replace it.	O
Let's see if it will function yes, good that will work.	O
All right?	O
Where is my drawing?	O
Love it is I don't want to reuse this too hot to wear those.	O
But I hope everyone is having a good 4th of July.	O
My family and all my friends are out celebrating and I'm like have fun.	O
It's not like there's a pandemic out there, but also, I'm just not a huge fan of 4th of July.	O
I've never liked all the fireworks and stuff like that, so I'm just hiding here at home.	O
So I'm not exactly sure what I want to do today.	O
I have this piece that I've been playing with on and off of my T fling character Nami MA.	O
I might actually move this over here if I can because that's where my camera is.	O
Let you guys 'cause it for me.	O
I like to zoom in really close like this and I know that sometimes that can really throw people off.	O
And then I can do that there OK?	O
Yeah, but I've been wanting to draw my teeflii character Numa in this very cute lingerie set I saw on Instagram.	O
So I'm going to do I might do this, but I also need to work on.	O
Designing a wow.	O
This is all new so that that that that that.	O
I also need to make a schedule thing so that I have like set schedule to stream and all that stuff 'cause I really need to get more dedicated to streaming, so I might actually start with that.	O
I hate the light bright white background.	O
And.	O
Let's see I kind of when I first started streaming on B hands, UM, I I was a guest for Voodoo Val on Adobe Live.	O
And I drew my specific character.	O
Ability to do date where she?	O
I drew this.	O
Here here we are, and it's this character that I originally designed for monster from and I really liked it and I really like how they came out and I really love drawing her.	O
It's she's always such a fun challenge to try to get this line look 'cause she's in monster prom.	O
If you've never heard of it, it is a game that you kind of call upon your inner evil side.	O
To be honest with you.	O
And oh, there we go, that looks, oh, that's how I can do it with a little mini window Amy, I see every learn something today.	O

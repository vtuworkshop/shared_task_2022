Atd brain and in master problem you can make horrible decisions and the whole point of the game is to get the monster that you like to go to prom with.	O
You have three days to do this and you have to make really really messed up decisions.	O
It's an 18YR over kind of game.	O
So if you're under the age of 18.	O
I'd recommend don't play it.	O
And I was me and vow like two years ago were like, oh, let's do an art stream together and we were like let's create our own monster prom characters.	O
And she picked a theme for me which was a slime, and I picked a theme for her, which was a glitch.	O
And Hello, Pumpkin.	O
My cat is coming into the screen.	O
Picture Fuzzy tail.	O
Outta here you little fluff and.	O
So that was kind of what we did and when I was on Adobe Live I we picked like a desert challenge and I was like, oh like raindrop cake in my slime girl blah blah blah.	O
Here she comes again.	O
You are such a tail out of here getting me.	O
I'm trying to stream Honey Bear.	O
So you think you doing she's being sassy right now.	O
I'm sorry guys, she's to stick in her, but every well my face go over there.	O
Thank you sweet pea and so I really had so much fun drawing this on Adobe live so I kind of wondered maybe I can turn her into my like.	O
My mascot, or you know my icon or you know that kind of thing.	O
So I've had a couple ideas of things I can do with her.	O
I had an idea of, like you know, what if there's a day where I want to stream, but I don't want to be on camera and I thought it would be kind of fun if I could draw her in a way where she's like like resting where my camera would be and she could like blink in her hair would be moving a little bit 'cause she's made out of Slime and things like that but.	O
Today I want to figure out what kind of schedule I could design and kind of like how occurs my little mask out like, oh, hello here's here's my schedule.	O
Come come watch the stream because that's something I need to work on badly.	O
And I'm also trying to find a way to ignore all the fireworks.	O
I don't know if I said that already here.	O
'cause I hate fireworks, so this is my way of doing that.	O
Let's see how long I last before I need to go crawl into a hole and play Animal Crossing, but.	O
Try to have some fun so.	O
Hum.	O
OK.	O
Let us see, let us see literacy.	O
Can I drag this like over here and then do this?	O
Hi can I knew there was a way I could get around it.	O
I'm still learning Photoshop my my Photoshop skills are an absolute mess.	O
So.	O
Right?	O
A texture or no texture.	O
Oh, there's no texture.	O
OK, cool, so never mind then.	O
Billy Ocean hard one.	O
You need food.	O
So what do I want to do?	O
what I want to do?	O
I know for like my icon on days where I don't want to stream, I kind of want her to be in a similar pose to this piece where she's kind of like leaning against the circle or something and you can see her blink.	O
But for the schedule, let's say.	O
So how is everyone's Day Going?	O
I hope we all are doing pretty good.	O
By the way, it's totally OK if you guys are lurkers like don't feel, don't feel pressured to hack the talk in chat if you don't want to.	O
I just got offered in my Yammer.	O
Don't mess with my light over there, pumpkin.	O
I see you being sassy.	O
Scheduled, I totally wrote that, very weird.	O

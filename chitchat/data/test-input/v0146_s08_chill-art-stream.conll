Hum.	O
OK, that's actually really freaking cute.	O
The way that is.	O
Everything down then over though there we are.	O
And as long as I started to learn and just because.	O
I am more of a fantasy man.	O
Oh yeah.	O
I love Anna Fysa.	O
I recently just a finalized my design for A.	O
Might.	O
Hobbit original character who's talking?	O
Who's talking?	O
Why you talking on suppose be talking.	O
Thank you.	O
Sorry, the soundtrack I'm listening to.	O
If you're interested is this.	O
Happy to see you lo fi hip hop mix by fear dog on YouTube and love their music so much.	O
It's so relaxing.	O
It's so soothing and it's kind of just.	O
It at least gives you why there's more talking.	O
It at least gives you just something to focus on.	O
That kind of thing.	O
How's the weather over there OK?	O
Um, I'm liking it so far.	O
So those are the roughs we're going to put those in a folder.	O
Save if you're working on something.	O
If you're drawing.	O
If you're writing on something, anything like that, control S or save your files.	O
Do not let them escape you, as this one almost escaped me.	O
OK, now this is going to be the hard part 'cause I don't know exactly how I want to design.	O
There's so many like so many different art styles that I enjoy and so many.	O
Just different appearances that I really love and it's like, oh, I want to do it this way.	O
But no, I want to do it that way.	O
And what about this way you know?	O
So it's going to.	O
Take me a hot minute to figure out what I want to do.	O
Uh.	O
If I missed your comment, please forgive me.	O
I'm looking at Pinterest for inspiration.	O
Um?	O
Accept purposes said had her.	O
Oh, that's cute.	O
That's not a calendar.	O
And that's cool.	O
I know I saved in that folder.	O
So do do do do do do do do.	O
I might I kind of like the idea.	O
OK, so I think.	O
Study girl yes I love study stuff.	O
OK, so I'm going to collapse this.	O
One more time.	O
For now, because I'm not going to be working on the girl, I'm going to be working on the overall thing so.	O
We're going to see how well I can do this.	O
Actually, wait, what am I doing?	O
There's a whole tool to do this.	O
Rounded rectangle tool.	O
Damn, I don't want it that way.	O
I want it this way.	O
Uhm no.	O
I want it that pastel pink and I want it.	O
Hey yo hey, can I actually?	O
No, I want to.	O
What is that can I do with this?	O
Like a hike on East good?	O
I love this team.	O
The team touch study builds up.	O
The only thing is I don't know if that's copyrighted music, so that's why I haven't.	O
I haven't used it or touch that that stuff yet, but I would love to have like her music playing from nothing.	O
OK, if he hit her.	O
Can I?	O
Oh, I can't do that.	O

Oh yes, cool.	O
I'm figuring out, uh?	O
And figuring out stuff, OK, nifty.	O
I liked it.	O
Yeah yeah yeah yeah OK.	O
Chilled cow, yes I love chilled cow.	O
If this is such a weird.	O
Uh.	O
Like thing.	O
But I know go back, I don't know undo OK, alright thank you and I will enter that's all I want, OK?	O
I want to go in.	O
Find 10.	O
Can I use this possible?	O
I don't know how possible this is going to be.	O
This probably very silly choice that I'm a gang.	O
No, it's not.	O
I almost want to make it look like animal crossy but I don't know how I would do that.	O
Well that just looking cute.	O
What am I talking about?	O
Z.	O
OK, looking pretty good to me.	O
Alright, and we're going to do this control paste.	O
Horizontal we're going to copy and paste this bad boy all over.	O
Nice alright, so we have a little firm Borderan Control Control V to paste it again.	O
We're going to flip it vertical going to get vertical in here.	O
Yeah.	O
All right, there we go looking good.	O
Down and copy it once more.	O
OK, I don't know why I'm doing it this way because I just want to.	O
Yeah.	O
I can do this shift.	O
OK.	O
It's such a weird, convoluted way to do this, but I don't really care.	O
Merciless down so OK and then want a tool and select inverse.	O
I wanna delete that now and create another layer.	O
I have no clue what I'm doing, but apparently I'm doing something.	O
Ah, that's what I needed to do.	O
And then I want to know.	O
Let's inverse and then I can.	O
There we go.	O
That's what I wanted.	O
Call gradients.	O
I like playing with the gradients on photo shop.	O
I think they're really cool.	O
I like that one.	O
OK, and.	O
Those layers.	O
OK.	O
I still have no concept as to what the heck I'm doing.	O
Can I owe vertical?	O
I don't know where the middle of this will be.	O
Right there.	O
Hair in my Isaac sees me.	O
That was a big boom.	O
It's actually working 'cause I like.	O
I said earlier.	O
I hate fireworks with a passion and I currently cannot hear them, but I can feel them.	O

I was able to.	O
I got permission from Adobe an from be hands to stream on behalf.	O
So as you're watching there should be this little pop up that comes up and it should say do you want to stream for Behance?	O
Click here and you can like submit an application to be hands to ask for permission.	O
'cause I think Adobe is still trying to figure out how Behance works and how to get it functioning and things like that.	O
And, uh.	O

Like 85 degrees in my room at this moment.	O
I have I love to see you all.	O
Thank you.	O
Thank you so much that makes you feel so good.	O
On such a timid streamer.	O
It's so goofy.	O
Like for someone who wants to make this like their profession, you know.	O
I get really, really anxious and I'm like OO.	O
No one wants to see me.	O
But that's just 'cause I have anxiety, but that's OK.	O
Send I'm really sorry for all the stupid freaking fireworks going on out there.	O
It's just been rude and dumb.	O
OK, I'm going to do this all the way across.	O
So I know how big I want my learners defer.	O
I love it when it does the weird dot anything that's fun.	O
OK, so I know how big I want my words.	O
I don't understand you better.	O
I don't speak English very well.	O
All I'm sorry.	O
But that's OK.	O
That's going to be my small letter size.	O
There we go.	O
Oh Geez.	O
I did not mean to zoom zoom in that much boy.	O
And they.	O
Look I'm excited that so many people from around the world are in here.	O
That's so freaking cool.	O
I get excited about that stuff.	O
This July 4th after all, I got my white cloth.	O
I unfortunately don't have any of those.	O
Um?	O
I've been feeling oddly, like indifferent about 4th of July lately.	O
I mean.	O
Maybe it's because of the state of the world right now and things like that, but it's it's.	O
It's a little weird.	O
Good Lord.	O
Better be fireworks or swear to G i'ma have to go out and beat someone up right now.	O
Yeah, my family, my mom's out with her boyfriend, my sisters with her fiance and her sons.	O
I'm here at home.	O
Just show my thing.	O
Are you doing a planner?	O
I'm trying to make a streaming schedule 'cause I I like streaming.	O
I want to make it mycareer.	O
It's so fun and it gives me an excuse to draw all day like I've always dreamed, but I am.	O
The worst at holding myself accountable.	O
So I am trying to make a schedule that I can adhere to and.	O
You know, just do kind of thing, so it's it's like a planner.	O
It's like my own planner and then I can post this on my be Hans and be like these are the days I'm guaranteed to stream, you know, and post it to my Twitter and things like that.	O
So that's the goal.	O
It's a schedule.	O
This is such a weird thing.	O
I like how I write certain letters and I just figure I can go in and copy them.	O

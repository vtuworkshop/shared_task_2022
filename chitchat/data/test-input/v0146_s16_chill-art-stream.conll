Yes.	O
Saturday OK, so I think that is looking pretty good.	O
For now, Oh Lord, in my eye.	O
I think I have a hair like in my eyes, so I'm going to turn my camera off really quick if I can find it.	O
'cause I'm blind.	O
Why is it that one?	O
OK, yeah, I don't want to see you guys to see me as I poked my eye because sometimes the stuff can get really gross.	O
What are you There you are?	O
Come here.	O
Oh, it was a little cat Fuzz.	O
Why am I not surprised from cat fuzz?	O
I'm back, buzz has been removed from my eyeball.	O
Do you think to be a designer?	O
You need to know how to draw.	O
Um?	O
Honestly, no, because there's there.	O
So there is no.	O
Well.	O
If you want to be a character designer.	O
You have to understand basic anatomy and one way you can start doing that is looking up like pose references on um.	O
On Pinterest or online and start drawing them, start tracing over them to try to figure out the flow of the body, how the anatomy works, um, things like that.	O
But if you're if you're designing clothes, whatever, not necessarily 'cause.	O
Art is such an interesting N broad creative spectrum.	O
You can do anything with it.	O
Um?	O
Man, I mean for me.	O
In my case I my goal is to be a character designer or an animator.	O
And so because of that I have to understand the anatomy of the face, the human anatomy of the body.	O
You know proportions, things like that.	O
'cause you can play with anatomy, but you have to understand how it works first.	O
If that makes any sense at all.	O
So it's I'd say it say yes and no kind of thing.	O
It's really.	O
It's really challenging.	O
It's really weird, but.	O
It depends on what you want to do.	O
What you do is a calendar.	O
What I'm doing.	O
Yeah, um, it's.	O
Because I want to start streaming regularly.	O
Doing it every couple days like a work schedule, you know your boss tells You You're coming in four days this week.	O
This is how many hours you're working.	O
I'm doing that for myself because I need to know I need to have a schedule for myself, otherwise I'll never.	O
I'll never work, you know, I've never do anything.	O
OK um.	O
Do do do do do do.	O
I'm gonna.	O
This.	O
I like that, OK.	O
Check get rid of that.	O
I'm going to.	O
Let's do this on another layer 'cause.	O
Like I said, I.	O
I want to get into streaming games.	O
But with all of the allegations and whatnot going on with Twitch lately, I don't know anymore of that, something that I wanted to do I probably will because I don't know any other streaming services.	O

Probably going to look like a mess if I take it down.	O
How do I draw the good guys?	O
Yeah, this is the longest my hair has been in like 5 years and it's so much I've had my head shaved.	O
As you can tell.	O
But yeah, even this is like Oh my good Lord but thank you.	O
Thank you.	O
I usually like it more of a pastel pink so having it be like this kind of highlighter pink is a little different for me.	O
But I can't.	O
It's harder to have pastel pink hair 'cause pink.	O
Is such as a kind of color that fades very quickly, so I have to touch it up consistently so I leave it highlighter pink and then it says thank you.	O
Thank you very much.	O
I I have a goal.	O
There's this old lady where does she live?	O
Her name is Elizabeth sweetheart.	O
She's also known as the green lady.	O
She's this old Granny.	O
Well, let's see, oh she's in Brooklyn.	O
So this very sweet old lady in Brooklyn and she's known as the green lady.	O
I'll drag it over here, look at her.	O
It's so green the look how happy she is like that.	O
That is my goal but pink like I I want to have almost everything.	O
I own beeping but I also love other colors too.	O
But like she is my future Gulf.	O
That's the kind of grandma that I want to be.	O
I could look at her, she's so precious you guys and she has the sweetest.	O
Like tiny little grandma voice and her husband is like she's happy.	O
Let it be green.	O
I adore her.	O
Her last name is sweetheart.	O
How cute is that?	O
Like how lucky do you have to be to have a goofy name like sweetheart?	O
It's like your last name being Habibi.	O

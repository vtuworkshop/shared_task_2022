There we are.	O
Oh yeah.	O
Her good cute, but are you making?	O
I am working on a schedule.	O
Let me zoom out here.	O
I really should turn on my navigator.	O
There we are, but I'm trying to make a streaming schedule, something that I will, you know, stick to streaming and he ran be hands or on twitch.	O
Whatever I decide to start doing, and so I'm trying to make like a, you know.	O
Like a little flyer kind of thing that I could post on my websites and stuff.	O
So I'm just here drawing a character of mine.	O
That I have.	O
For now.	O
Just like in making a little bit cutesy in little fuzzy kind of thing, I do need a Scrooge.	O
Eyes up.	O
There we are.	O
There we are.	O
And I am going to do this.	O
And now we got there, OK?	O
There I have my navigator up so you guys can see a little better.	O
Well doing here.	O
'cause I know that I like to zoom in a lot.	O
I still need to.	O
No more fireworks.	O
What is that?	O
What is that from?	O
The audio is so familiar.	O
That was so familiar I cannot think of what the audio was from man.	O
I just like like I recognize it and I was like wow.	O
Can you help me teach sketch work?	O
I am not very good at teaching.	O
I just kind of, uh.	O
Sketch work is just something that I've really self taught.	O
You know, and I'm not really that good at it.	O
I know it looks like I'm good, but.	O
I think sketch work is one of those things that you kind of have to.	O
In a way, figure out on your own time kind of thing.	O
Um?	O
There we go.	O
But I'm I'm not really that good of a teacher.	O
I'm sorry.	O
Hello, welcome to welcome in.	O
I lost my ability to speak for half a second.	O
But welcome welcome hello.	O
How are you doing today?	O
Thanks for mouth is too big.	O
I think that's what we're getting me out right now.	O
There we go.	O
I always saw her with kind of a small.	O
With a bit of a small mouse.	O
Sorry, I thought I saw someone outside in my driveway.	O
I was all ready to fly out my front door.	O
Getting ready to beat someone up.	O
This is such an odd like perspective to draw someone from is like kind of from below a little bit.	O
'cause sometimes like their faces kind of come off a little chunky's double chin.	O
What was in the driveway?	O
I'm not sure.	O
I think I think it was just like maybe my glasses reflecting off of my window, but I'm not getting an alert on my security camera.	O

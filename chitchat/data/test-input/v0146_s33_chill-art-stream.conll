How are you doing today?	O
So like 2:00 o'clock or 3:00 o'clock in the morning for you out there good NIS.	O
Where?	O
There we are.	O
Drop her.	O
She's using like this little like 2 top.	O
Kind of thing.	O
Night Owls Yup.	O
That definitely are.	O
I think to an extent well.	O
I think in my case 'cause when I was when I was very young, I was on a Ritalin for 80 D an I could never sleep.	O
Until late, like late, late late at night.	O
And.	O
It would always drive my mother and my stepfather nuts.	O
'cause you know, I wasn't like elementary school and you gotta go to school tomorrow morning, but I just I could never ever sleep.	O
'cause of the freaking medication that was on.	O
Um?	O
The unlike.	O
I think because of that.	O
You know, for a long time in my youth.	O
And my youngin days.	O
I was a night owl.	O
I think now as an adult and so very much that kind of night.	O
Owl person.	O
Even though it drives my mother nuts.	O
English is not.	O
She's not here today, so she can't yell at me.	O
I think.	O
Even though my full grown adult.	O
I need with a lid.	O
It is like I I was on Ritalin for a very long time as a youngin.	O
But it started really messing with me and messing with my diet and my weight like I was extremely underweight when I was in elementary school.	O
I was like I think 10 or 15 pounds under under weights 'cause I just never I could eat.	O
I was just like Nope, not hungry.	O
Which was.	O
And healthy for a grown little lassie like myself.	O
Um?	O
And like.	O
So my mom took me off of it because she was like, heck, that.	O
And then I tried getting back on it.	O
In high school back in maybe 2016 and I like.	O
Full blown panic attack in the middle of my science class like.	O
I felt like I was ready to die.	O
You know something was going to happen.	O
I was going to die and you know everything sucked.	O
It was.	O
It was a very weird.	O
Experience.	O
So I haven't.	O
I haven't touched Ritalin or any kind of medication in a very long time because of that.	O
All day I do nothing but sleep.	O
And then at night, I'm like, OK, it's time I prefer to work on night.	O
It's more quiet.	O
I'm from Colombia.	O
I need to learn more English now you're good.	O
I can understand you.	O
I can understand and you are good.	O
Look at the rest of the world.	O
Has to learn how to speak English here in America can learn how to speak other languages too, right?	O
English 8 the superior language.	O
I'm telling you that right now.	O
If anything, it's more confusing.	O
The Anatomy is really wonky, but I'm just playing.	O
This one negative side effects.	O
Huh?	O
Vinings, I haven't heard of that one before.	O

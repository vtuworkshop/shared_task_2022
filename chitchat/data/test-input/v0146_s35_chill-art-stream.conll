Monkey.	O
Oh, one of those guys.	O
OK those yeah, those guys are obnoxious.	O
From what I understand.	O
Oh man, he tried to come home with Maine uh huh.	O
Sure.	O
Absolutely.	O
Oh I.	O
I was able to get just enough of it.	O
Check out.	O
And I want that up here.	O
There we go OK.	O
I always draw the other ear as like as much into view as I can, 'cause it never looks right unless they do.	O
They jump in a car, jump in the backpack, seal food, they bonded.	O
Hello, welcome to the stream.	O
Hello hello everybody.	O
Anything?	O
It's still this.	O
It's 'cause I have this like angle then that's more rounded.	O
I think that's what's.	O
Tripping me up.	O
Nope.	O
Yes, that's exactly what it is, OK.	O
Hang on.	O
It.	O
Sorry, that's been like driving me nuts this entire freaking time.	O
And now I can fix it.	O
I don't wait, Nope.	O
Oh, much better.	O
There we go.	O
There we are.	O
Flip it.	O
Oh yeah, that's much better.	O
There we go, so we sauce.	O
OK, and I'm going to do this.	O
'cause she's she's slime so you can see through her.	O
A little bit.	O
I really want to draw this.	O
I don't know if it would be considered not safe for work 'cause she's she's a slime monster.	O
UM, for the game monster from.	O
And.	O
Like I drew that looks really great.	O
First time live streaming.	O
Oh no, no you have to sleep.	O
I'm still believe I'm still new at all this so, but this girl here.	O
That I'm drawing is this lovely little cutie here.	O
And I designed this character a couple months ago on Adobe live with Voodoo Val and it was like we were going to do a dessert challenge where we pick desserts and we Draw Something based off of those desserts.	O
And I've had this character for.	O
Two years now.	O
A game called Monster from it's really fun.	O
It's horrible.	O
Don't play it unless you're over the age of 18.	O
It makes you make bad decisions, very bad decisions, but I made her this character as like a you know what if I had a character in this game.	O
And she's like a Slime Monster, and so she she's like like A.	O
Like a gelatinous cube kind of thing if you know D&D, but you know, as I love the pink girl and so like she can disconnect her body like you can see her arms or disconnected.	O
Her neck is never just connected to her torso so her head can float around.	O
Her body can float around and I really want to drop her like lifting up her shirt like showing her stomach with like knives or like a bomb or something inside of her stomach.	O
I don't know why, just make it a little like spooky.	O
I drove that be considered nothing to work 'cause it's it's showing her Tony.	O
But March 2 uneventful birthday.	O

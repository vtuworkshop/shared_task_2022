Oh no.	O
My birthday is on 14th days and like what's going to happen because I'll just pandemic.	O
I don't care about going outside.	O
When is your birthday?	O
My birthday is November 27th.	O
And I'm going to be.	O
28 This year Great.	O
So I'm I've never really been a birthday person myself.	O
I was when I was younger.	O
I love the colors in your character.	O
She needs to be able to transform one of her arms into a shotgun.	O
I could see her doing that, but like a water gun and so she's like shoot little bits of Slime at people.	O
Had to be fun hide like a needle in it so she can like stab him.	O
Pardon me.	O
Oh Listen its presence.	O
But now my birthday is in November.	O
I was thinking of maybe, um, 'cause I have a lot of friends have Animal Crossing on the switch may be like.	O
Setting up like a like a birthday thing.	O
On there, but I.	O
I don't know birthday parties.	O
Dude, I don't know what you do.	O
I don't know what people do.	O
Thank you.	O
I'm usually the kind of sneezer like who spits a lot, so I was like please duck.	O
Don't let them see be spent.	O
Um?	O
Where is that other picture of her actually?	O
This is another picture of her.	O
I want this one over here though.	O
Can I put these two in the same tab a high can?	O
OK, so this is like her design.	O
If she was just walking around in the game.	O
Hum.	O
So I want to draw her in that outfit.	O
Oh, I was like what the heck?	O
I really like the design.	O
I had a lot of fun when I created her and I was like when I drew her for.	O
The stream with food of Val.	O
I I kind of wondered about making her my thumb.	O
Like my.	O
It was a stupid word.	O
My mascot kind of thing so.	O
That's what I'm trying to do.	O
By drawing her in here.	O
And so because she's translucent.	O
You hear all that?	O
I'll spit fetishizes yeah.	O
You're welcome.	O
Now send me money through PayPal.	O
Can you give us some advice?	O
Some tips to have more interactions on be hands.	O
Honestly, I'm.	O
I'm still trying to figure it out myself.	O
Um, I'm not.	O
I'm not that big of a streamer myself.	O
I'm still exceptionally new at all this.	O
Um?	O
I when I post my projects or when I go to stream, I try to use as many.	O
Description tags as I possibly can.	O
Um?	O
And it's I think it's all mostly just a manner of luck.	O
And finding the right time to post things.	O
'cause one thing I've noticed is for when I first started streaming on be hand, I would stream from like 1:00 o'clock to three an I notice I had no, I didn't have a chat box.	O
If you guys go back and look at my very first few streams I had nobody in my chat.	O
But then again, throughout the day.	O
Adobe light is on an an people are at work.	O
You know that kind of thing.	O
This other things that people watched in the day.	O
So it was a little harder for me.	O

I'm still trying to figure this stuff out myself.	O
Um?	O
So to give you proper advice.	O
It's it's a little tough.	O
You know, and I'm sorry.	O
That I can't really give you more on that.	O
Just just keep experimenting with what time you post when you're most active.	O
And just keep doing it.	O
Keep doing it because it's really disheartening when you put so much work and so much effort is so much love into whatever it is that you're doing, and there's no one there to share it with.	O

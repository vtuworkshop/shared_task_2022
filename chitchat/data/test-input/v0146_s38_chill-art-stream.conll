There's no.	O
I mean, I'm not exactly sure.	O
I think for in my case.	O
Um?	O
When I first started streaming on be hands, I did a show with voodoo Val who works with Adobe and she has her own little like drawing show and she had me on that her and I are really good friends and I think because of that opportunity I had a little bit of like, you know a push and because of that you know that was on Adobe live.	O
More people look at my stuff.	O
But I'm still very much.	O
Trying to figure out.	O
How to get?	O
My stuff out there.	O
You know how to get more viewers and things like that, and I think looking at other artists that I follow on Instagram on Twitter, you know everywhere.	O
I think it's a mix of.	O
Keep pushing, keep posting.	O
Keep doing stuff.	O
Keep working forward you know.	O
An experiment.	O
At the same time.	O
If that makes sense.	O
Can I ask what you use?	O
I have a Wacom intuos.	O
From old school into US.	O
I think this thing is like 2 three years old now.	O
This is a little old.	O
But that's OK.	O
OK.	O
So we're getting somewhere.	O
And figuring it out.	O
Uh-huh Huh?	O
My gummies Sorry if my eating sound are really obvious.	O
The last time I got a message from someone in the USA, we did an interview, but I had to be next to a translator because I couldn't understand at all what he was saying.	O
Oh, OK.	O
I think that project is not going to keep ahead because of the communication.	O
On I would say that could be.	O
A possibility, uhm?	O
But it.	O
Here's the thing if.	O
And this is a problem that I have with with other people from America.	O
I'm from the USA and things like that is.	O
We're so stuck up about her own language were so stuck up about.	O
I I can understand that I don't want to work with them or all that kind of crap, you know.	O
Yes, I did throw my pen.	O
And.	O
I think that's stupid and if this person that you were working with.	O
Isn't willing to work past the communication problems.	O
Ann Work with you on this project.	O
Are they really someone you want to work with?	O
You know what I mean?	O
You don't want to.	O
You don't want to work with someone who's.	O
Who is just going to be a freaking stick in the mud?	O
And Oh, Jesus.	O
You know it's.	O
You don't know.	O
Work with someone who's.	O
Excuse my language, a You don't, you know, and I I'm sorry for using inappropriate language.	O
Um?	O
But like.	O
You know, just just I'd say, keep trying, keep working towards.	O
You know, yeah yeah.	O
And if someone's going to be stuck up about.	O
Needing a translator, you know if you're passionate for this project and if you want it to work.	O
Keep fighting for it, but if a Jack Wagon if a jerk face is going to be a jerk face because communication problems.	O
Do you really want to work with someone who's like that?	O
You know what I mean?	O
'cause I have family members who hate communicating with people who don't speak English very well and I'm like sucks to be you because you miss out on a lot of really good people out there, you know.	O

So I get fired up about this stuff.	O
But I think he.	O
Keep trying, keep pushing.	O
If you're passionate about it.	O
If it's something you want, you know don't.	O
Don't give up.	O
But if this person is being a jerk.	O
Kick him out, you know there you might have to put the project on hold, but.	O
It is so much better doing that then.	O
Fighting and working with someone who's.	O
An Excuse my language, that's the last curse word I'll use for the night.	O
You know?	O
The keep keep don't give up just because of language barriers.	O
Language barriers should never be a problem.	O
You know, never ever.	O
It's a language for God sakes.	O
Learn it.	O
Figure it out.	O
You know, if the rest of the world is pressured to learn English, we here in America can learn how to speak other languages too.	O
Just say it.	O
Can you try to communicate and learn a little bit in language, yeah.	O
In my experience, when I have been to European countries, if I try to speak a little bit, they were willing to try.	O
So yeah, yeah.	O
Well that's The thing is you don't have to be great.	O
You know, at speaking a language is it is your effort like.	O
I've never had a business where I work with people.	O
I've always had retail jobs.	O
And.	O
I remember this one point.	O
It was so it's so dumb it was after.	O
The.	O
Third of my cat.	O
Sorry, that was my cats tail.	O
I think it was after.	O
Toy Story three came out an you know Buzz.	O
Buzz Lightyear goes into Spanish mode.	O
And it was not long after that and.	O
It's a weekend.	O
You're all mods are vacation received a cuss a little bit sweet?	O
So going to watch my language though 'cause they're going to come back and look at my video and I'm going to be like, oh.	O
But I was working at my retail job an.	O
I'm just doing my thing and this lady came up, but she only spoke Spanish an you know how blessed spaniel and I said no.	O
Unfortunately I don't you know and no one else in the stored it and I asked her what can I do to help you and she's kind of stood there and she thought really hard.	O
And she held up her finger like this and she ran off and she came back with a shirt and she said, Don't they stop?	O
And like my brain.	O
Like I just remembered the scene in the movie of Toy Story 3 of Buzz Lightyear running around when they're in the trash compactor looking for Jesse and he goes to new data.	O
Then you need to stop and I was like where is this that she goes see?	O
And I was like, I understand, you're talking about let's go, you know.	O
and I was able to help her an like you know that was like one of my favorite moments working in retail and I hate retail, you know, but like.	O
Language.	O
There's too many people on this planet to speak one language.	O
I'm sorry I get really fired up and really excited about that stuff.	O
Even though I only know English and American Sign Language, but still, you know?	O
And live your ask me what I ate earlier?	O
Um, I'm eating Ritz bits and I have this drink that has baby coconut.	O
In it, so it's like little gummies.	O
And it's delicious.	O
You're so sweet and savory.	O
Ah.	O
I'm still having problems with her face.	O
I'm probably going to have to redraw it.	O
I've been talking like crazy.	O
No, I'm not drinking alcohol.	O
Wish I was.	O
App.	O
I I forget very often that I am actually old enough.	O

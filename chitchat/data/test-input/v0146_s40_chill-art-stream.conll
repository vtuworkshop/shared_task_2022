I don't drink that often.	O
I mean, I was raised in a house for like you know, my mom growing up.	O
She hated alcohol with every fiber of her being.	O
She hated alcohol so you know, I kind of, you know, you adhere to the thought process of your parents when you're young and so I kind of stuck with that.	O
An you know, as an adult my mom's relax a little bit and like.	O
Yeah, yeah, like my mom in the past couple of years has started drinking wine and I'm like.	O
Who are you and what have you done with my mom?	O
Like you like wine and.	O
And football.	O
Huh?	O
But like where we are now living in a safer environment where we can be more ourselves.	O
So it's cool that I get to learn a whole new part of my mom.	O
But at the same time I'm like.	O
Is this you or is just this like hardcore rebound?	O
Kind of thing that happens after you move out of a toxic situation.	O
I don't know yet.	O
I survived on Ritz bits when I was at base girlfriends house.	O
You know you could have complained.	O
I would have.	O
Then again, I'm I'm a little but then I would be guilty about it.	O

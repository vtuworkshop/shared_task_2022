When I was very young I was.	O
5 or 6.	O
Pardon me.	O
Hello Jane, good it good evening from America.	O
It is midnight here.	O
Hello, welcome to the stream of Oh my gosh I'm so excited but uh, when I was like.	O
Six years old.	O
My dad, who was 32 at the time.	O
Married a 16 year old.	O
And I was like like you know, I was six.	O
I didn't understand the time and now I'm I'm almost 30 myself.	O
I'm and it's like just imagining that.	O
I'm like.	O
Dude.	O
Can't.	O
81 and 57 Oh wow.	O
Like it can work, you know, but	O
So about 81 and 57, that's crazy.	O
That's a 30 year difference.	O
That's amazing.	O
I don't know, maybe it's just me, or maybe it's just because I saw my dad in that kind of situation and I loved his.	O
I loved her.	O
I love that life so much.	O
She was my best friend.	O
Like I viewed her like a mother.	O
But I guess she cheated on my dad and like one day like we only saw my dad every other weekend.	O
You know 'cause it was the.	O
Dual custody kind of thing and one weekend she just wasn't there.	O
She was just gone.	O
An like my little 5 year old brain perceived it as if she had just straight up died.	O
And so I went through like the morning process of like.	O
A child who just lost their mother, you know?	O
So it was a really weird situation for me and I think because of that, like I kind of have just like a bitter taste in my mouth.	O
You know, from a large age difference like that.	O
How long were they married?	O
On way back.	O
Maybe like a year and a half.	O
They weren't married that long, but when you're a kid, you know time.	O
You feel like you're an 8 year old for 17 years, you know, and now that like when you're an adult, you feel like you're.	O
20 for 10 minutes, you know.	O
So I don't really remember.	O
I don't remember a lot about that time in my life 'cause I was.	O
I was so young and just like.	O
I was so ridiculously destroyed like look not ridiculous because the motions that I had at a time were real.	O
You know they were.	O
As much as a 16 year as a 6 year old could.	O
Perceive someone as their mother.	O
I loved this woman to death yeah, yeah and that's that's.	O
I mean she didn't die she just cheated on my dad.	O
He was just which is crappy.	O
But then again she 16 she's a child.	O
You know, like if she was in her 20s or you know whatever and dad was in his.	O
You know later 30s or early 40s.	O
That's a little bit different.	O
You little bit more mature.	O
You know most the time, most the time, but like.	O
16 year old Most 16 year olds are dumb.	O
I mean, I was dumb 16 year old.	O
But yeah, like my my little baby brain was just like she died.	O
Ah.	O
It it messed me up for years.	O
Like I I I remember going into therapy and being like why am I here?	O
There's a name for that.	O
There is a name for that.	O
Absolutely there is.	O
And it's weird, 'cause like.	O
I don't know putting that title.	O
To your father.	O
Is a weird bitterness.	O
In the most.	O
Most.	O
Both.	O
Dane Cook jokes.	O
Oh my God, it's.	O
I'm getting the Sleepies.	O
I'm taking Dane Cook joke.	O

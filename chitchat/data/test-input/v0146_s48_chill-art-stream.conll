These two brushes that I'm clicking on or the same one.	O
Oh, now it's behaving.	O
So if you notice, when I was drawing those lines before.	O
The lines were very like this.	O
They were very thick.	O
They were completely black.	O
There was no like translucence.	O
I guess you could say in the line work.	O
An sometimes photo shop itself conflict, wig out and make that happen, but if my drawing tablet needs to have an update.	O
Like it won't register my pen sensitivity.	O
Yeah, see how it's like really firm and dark right there and it's really light right here that's that's usually.	O
That's because I'm pushing down on my pen like.	O
Right, so stop it.	O
Don't be sassy.	O
So like right now I'm barely pressing on my tablet, but if I press harder.	O
Now it's dark and if the Wacom tablet needs to update.	O
Then It won't register any sensitivity, but it's working, so I'm going to keep trying.	O
'cause I'm in the mojo for it.	O
I found a weird little workflow for me.	O

You know what I must do it.	O

But not a whole lot.	O
Little bit lighter.	O
Actually.	O
There we are.	O
There we go, little bit better.	O

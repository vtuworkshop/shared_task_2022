This hair and put it.	O
There we go behind.	O
I work really strange.	O
I have all these layers over here, um.	O
And that's like that's how I work is because I also like going through and I like changing the color of Jesus.	O
Sorry.	O
I like going in and changing the color of the line art.	O
You know, when I when I start coloring?	O
Um?	O
And how I do that is I draw everything on its own layers, like all the skin is on his own layer, the face is on its own layer.	O
The iris is the hair.	O
Sometimes the eyebrows.	O
You know that kind of thing, so that as I when I get into the drawing there the coloring stages later on I can come back and play with the line art of specific things and not have it affect anything else.	O
Is an absolute mess.	O
To do, but it's.	O
But I decided works.	O
It's a very strange working system and I don't.	O
I don't remember exactly when I started doing this kind of stuff, but it's been too long to change.	O
I'm so happy with this cell phone.	O
I love the eyes.	O
Thank you.	O
I think they're very cute like the eyes and the nose.	O
I love when people draw noses like that.	O
I don't know why.	O
I just think I'm just like Jesus is so cute.	O
OK, so things.	O
Moments.	O
There we are.	O
OK.	O
And time for her shoulders now.	O
I'm going to pull back my pull up.	O
My Navigator Navigator Navigator so you guys can see.	O
The whole picture.	O
Of what I'm working on.	O
There we are.	O
And I'm going to.	O
There we go.	O

Has anyone seen?	O
Um X men first class.	O
With James McAvoy and Michael Fasbender.	O
It's one of my favorite extra movies.	O

It's not like the best series like like the live action X men has always been an up and down ride, but I will never forget.	O
I have the Hugest crush on Daisy Gateway, but, uh.	O
I'll never forget the scene in the X men first class like the very beginning, where young.	O
Uh.	O
Professor X Oh my God, I almost forgot his name.	O
I was like ready to throw myself out the window I was like.	O
But Young Professor X is flirting with a girl and he's like heterochromia.	O

You know that the Groovy.	O
So every time I see that word I'm like.	O

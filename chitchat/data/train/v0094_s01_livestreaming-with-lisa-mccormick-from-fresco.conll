Very earth tone palette.	O
And let me see if I can find.	CHITCHAT
Our Poland, something that's maybe.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, this is another one that's.	CHITCHAT
I love that color.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just like some of those those three colors right there like.	CHITCHAT
I just love that.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, maybe I'll.	CHITCHAT
I'll live in that.	CHITCHAT
Arena for tonight just to kind of switch things up is I.	O
Like to do.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, let me see.	CHITCHAT
So these are some of the brushes that I have.	O
As you can see, it says Kyle's and then whatever the brushes.	O
So Kyle is I think it's Kyle T Webster's the full his full name, but he's known for making his own brushes and.	O
He's been around for a really long time.	CHITCHAT
You can buy them on his website and Whatnot, but actually now all of these brushes come with your Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.	O
So these are all free with fresco.	O
In case you guys were.	CHITCHAT
Looking for some some cool um?	CHITCHAT
Some cool new brushes.	CHITCHAT
Go ahead.	CHITCHAT
Go on um.	CHITCHAT
Adobe Creative Cloud and you can you know Google or not Google sorry you can search.	O
Brushes and you'll actually just fine these for free, which is super nice.	O
So this is kind of nice.	CHITCHAT
It's like a rougher edge.	O
So I think I'm realizing with pixel brushes I have to kind of go.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
A little bit larger.	O
So if I let's just do one thing at a time, so I mean I'm going to start with this middle one.	O
I think like this guy right here.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
It's super simple, but.	CHITCHAT
I really like that one, so I'm going to duplicate this layer, hide that had that and now I'm just going to erase.	O
Uhm, actually I'll make this a lot larger.	O
And erase the access.	O
Part of the.	O
The sketchbook drawing.	O
Um, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
And I'll turn this stone a little bit opacity wise and.	O
Yeah, I just want to make sure that.	CHITCHAT
Looking good OK uhm.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and another thing that I think I was.	CHITCHAT
Um, explaining a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Was there is this?	CHITCHAT
New feature with fresco as well.	O
That is the ruler tool.	O
So that's super nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, most even might be nice to do something like.	O
Kind of like a quick grid.	O
Just to help make sure everything I'm doing is.	O
Perspectively correct?	O
Lips.	O
But yeah, I just found out about that feature.	CHITCHAT
I think like last week.	CHITCHAT
So that'll hopefully just help a little bit with.	CHITCHAT
I'm just making this really, really quickly.	CHITCHAT
I'm not even making like the square box is necessarily, it's more so just making sure the lines themselves are.	O
Straight since.	O
I will be using a uhm.	CHITCHAT

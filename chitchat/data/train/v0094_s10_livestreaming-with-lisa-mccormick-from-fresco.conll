I'll probably run out of room if I do that.	O
Well, keep him.	O
This size, for now at least.	O
I do typically like like really sick line, so in design.	CHITCHAT
Can really says one illustrator that I aspire to be more like is Tony.	CHITCHAT
Dinner Lizzie, sorry I probably totally butchered his last name, but um fantasy but still pretty stylized it.	CHITCHAT
That makes sense.	CHITCHAT
Totally, that's really cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll definitely have to look him up after this, I's love.	CHITCHAT
Learning about other artists and just different things that people are into.	CHITCHAT
So thanks for sharing.	CHITCHAT
Hey, there is um.	CHITCHAT
Eve says Morning, May I have your advice on how to keep learning and improving?	CHITCHAT
How do you keep pushing yourselves to keep up to date?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, yeah, that's a great question, uhm?	CHITCHAT
How do I keep pushing myself?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Well so I am.	CHITCHAT
Um, officially a full time freelance artist.	CHITCHAT
So that's I've been.	CHITCHAT
I've had my own company now for about, uh well, full time for a couple years and I started part time freelancing.	CHITCHAT
Other side probably.	CHITCHAT
Seven years ago.	CHITCHAT
So definitely takes awhile.	CHITCHAT
But I would say you know just the love of Art an knowing that I would rather you know spend twice is.	CHITCHAT
Many hours working at something I love rather than uhm.	CHITCHAT
Working at I guess the desk job for me personally it felt worth it, so I think just like continually putting in all those hours and for me a big motivator is having that.	CHITCHAT
Um, really, that flexibility to be able to create and also.	CHITCHAT
Make my own schedule.	CHITCHAT
And so, just like this type of lifestyle is something that I really, really value, especially as I'm really big in.	CHITCHAT
Just being a part of the community and having this life outside of work.	CHITCHAT
Really.	CHITCHAT
Uh, one of my big values is even just spending time with family and friends and so just being able to.	CHITCHAT
To kind of manoeuvre my hours in order to be able to maximize my time.	CHITCHAT
To be able to balance life a little bit more has been a huge motivator, but also, I mean paying the Bills is also very, very large motivators.	CHITCHAT
So sometimes it's kind of just as simple as.	CHITCHAT
You know needing to be able to put food on the table and.	CHITCHAT
Marketing yourself, sending emails, networking um.	CHITCHAT
Building your portfolio.	CHITCHAT
I would definitely say freelancing.	CHITCHAT
In particular.	CHITCHAT
You if you want to do it, you should expect to at least.	CHITCHAT
Put in twice as many hours.	CHITCHAT
Um, in a week as a regular work week, uhm?	CHITCHAT

Be actual grass color.	O
That would be helpful.	O
See I just want to say hi again to everyone in its tuning in.	CHITCHAT
I'm seeing again some some new faces.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, let me know where you guys are tuning in from in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm here to talk so.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Camden is asking, do you ever add perspective blur or motion blur?	O
I actually don't.	O
And mostly just because I'm not sure how to do that in Frisco.	O
So yeah, do you have you added motion blur?	O
Perspective blur in fresco.	O
Is that a feature actually really don't know.	O
So yeah, I'd love to hear more about that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, do we like the grass or is that kind of weird?	CHITCHAT
It's kind of looking weird I think.	CHITCHAT
What if I made it like?	O
More like stubby like actual.	O
Blades of grass.	O
Um Camden is saying it could be, but I tried it in procreate.	O
Oh yes, actually.	CHITCHAT
I do remember seeing that in procreate.	O
I can't.	O
Remember seeing it in Frisco?	O
I'm trying to think back.	CHITCHAT
I know that they recently had a big update for fresco so.	O
There's like a potential that.	O
It might be available now, but honestly I'm not really sure.	O
I feel like there's.	CHITCHAT
There's still a lot of things that Adobe is working on adding to fresco that aren't available yet, so I could kind of see that going either way.	O
Alright, I feel like all these little like.	O
Colorful additional lines turn this totally until I get children's design, which is kind of fun.	O
I love that.	CHITCHAT
That is something that I want to do more of.	CHITCHAT
I've made a lot of merchandise, mostly for women's clothes.	CHITCHAT
Which is really.	CHITCHAT
Really fun, really great, super thankful for all those opportunities.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think it would be really fun also too.	CHITCHAT
To make clothes for kids.	CHITCHAT
I think that would be.	CHITCHAT
Let me super cool.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see what else we got.	CHITCHAT
In terms of our sketches.	CHITCHAT
Um, Camden, what did you think about it in procreate?	O
I don't think I actually ever tried it in procreate.	O
I just remember hearing about it.	O
Yes, I'm curious whether.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, what your thoughts are.	CHITCHAT
If you liked it if.	CHITCHAT
It was kind of weird if it was cool.	CHITCHAT
So this is another one that is.	CHITCHAT
A rough, rough sketch?	CHITCHAT

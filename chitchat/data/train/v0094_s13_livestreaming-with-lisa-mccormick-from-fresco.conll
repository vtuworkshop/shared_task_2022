Uh, please don't make fun of me for the Wolf drawing that looks kind of terrible.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But this is another one that I feel like this would totally be a super cute little kiddos.	CHITCHAT
T-shirt graphic.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I keep on doing the.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Keep doing like a dark Navy background.	O
I want to maybe switch it up this time and do like a lighter background and have darker paint color.	O
I think that might be a fun little switch.	CHITCHAT
So we can do.	CHITCHAT
Maybe the cream color for the background and then.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I guess I could just straight up.	O
Swap it for just.	O
Blue A blue ink.	O
Also, I'm going to definitely make this wider again like I did the other ones 'cause.	O
Drawing is a little bit too skinny.	CHITCHAT
God be able to breathe.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we're going to come all the way over to.	O
The again I did just a really quick basic.	O
Um grid in the background.	O
Using my ruler tool.	O
Since mostly just to help make sure that my lines are straight, this certainly is not perfect.	O
Square boxes by any means, but at least helps with, you know, making that 90 degree angle.	O
It's a little bit more.	O
More close.	O
But also my style is such that I do kind of like the.	CHITCHAT
The little Flaws and Organic.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I guess just ways that things.	CHITCHAT
Things might move and be a little bit off.	CHITCHAT
I don't mind that.	CHITCHAT
See, I'm even making these trees a little bit more WAVY.	O
Because why not?	CHITCHAT
Whenever I draw trees, I swear I always.	CHITCHAT
Think about uhm.	CHITCHAT
The Pacific Northwest Because.	CHITCHAT
So OK, so I'm from the Midwest and we.	CHITCHAT
Do not have.	CHITCHAT
Doctor Seuss trees we have.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know what kind of we have Oak trees.	CHITCHAT
We have Willow trees.	CHITCHAT
We have pine trees, but we don't have.	CHITCHAT
The type of trees that look like.	CHITCHAT
A whole character in and of itself.	CHITCHAT
Um, so when I went, my sister actually now lives in Seattle.	CHITCHAT
She's lived there for.	CHITCHAT
Ha, I think it's been almost like five years or so now, uhm?	CHITCHAT
But why?	CHITCHAT
I'll never forget the first time.	CHITCHAT
Going over to Seattle going over to.	CHITCHAT
Um, was that we were driving over there, helping her move in.	CHITCHAT
And well, first of all, landing on the landing.	CHITCHAT
There it was.	CHITCHAT
It was a Wonderland like there.	CHITCHAT
I know there's that like hashtag or that.	CHITCHAT
Instagram that says, like PMW Wonderland, it literally is that like they're not exaggerating.	CHITCHAT
This the trees look like they're alive.	CHITCHAT
There's Moss in green and plants growing out of everything like everything it's just it's crazy it's beautiful.	CHITCHAT
The trees are so thick.	CHITCHAT

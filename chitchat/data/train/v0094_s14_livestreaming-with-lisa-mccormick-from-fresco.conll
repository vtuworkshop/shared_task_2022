And they kind of because I think of all the rain and all of the.	CHITCHAT
Um snow and Whatnot, and just the way it things grow there, they.	CHITCHAT
They take on these like.	CHITCHAT
So much weight.	CHITCHAT
So the trees themselves actually like curve and shift, and it really does look like its own personality.	CHITCHAT
This own character and just super cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's that's a place where an if you have the opportunity.	CHITCHAT
To go there, or a climate that similar to just go hike.	CHITCHAT
Unplug.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of hit that reset button on your soul.	CHITCHAT
And just explore, it really makes you feel like a kid again.	CHITCHAT
Just exploring and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, anyway so I can.	CHITCHAT
I could go on and on.	CHITCHAT
About that experience, but it was just it's obviously impacted me and it's.	CHITCHAT
It showed up in my art work all these years since and.	CHITCHAT
Sure, it'll keep showing up for years to come.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
So this is my weird little.	O
Drawing right now, so this is like a little I don't know if that Wolf looks looks a little bad.	O
I should probably try to.	O
Do.	O
A little bit of like shaping.	O
So that.	O
Maybe it look a little better.	O
Girl.	O
I also feel like that color maybe makes him look.	O
Kind of more like a Fox.	O
At low.	O
I might be a little bit better at least alright?	CHITCHAT
Well, I'll leave it for now.	O
Again, it's kind of more like a kids T shirt or what have you.	O
So it's OK if it's a little quirky.	O
And.	O
So we got this little waterfall.	O
Coming down.	O
Do.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
So we're definitely going to need a phone.	O
I always gravitate for pink for son, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Exactly what's wrong with me, but that is in my mind the color of the sun is either pink or red, which is so.	CHITCHAT
Inaccurate, yet I think I just want it to be so.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It looks little dumb.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh Alright, is that I feel like this this what this supposed to be.	O
A Wolf looks more like a dog or something.	O
I should mass that and make it.	O
Gray, that's probably may be helpful.	O
Because he just doesn't look like Wolf.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK, this is actually going to be kind of weird 'cause I'm trying to change the color.	CHITCHAT

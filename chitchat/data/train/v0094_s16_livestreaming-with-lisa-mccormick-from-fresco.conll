I'm just thinking sitting here, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it's important to find what makes you unique and not just like I know.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I've noticed some people that will.	CHITCHAT
For lack of better words, just kind of mimic other artists completely.	CHITCHAT
And Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Like I just, I think they're kind of.	CHITCHAT
Selling themselves short because I think that I think they have something unique to offer without having to look like the next person exactly.	CHITCHAT
Obviously there's going to be trends and things that resonate with people that.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't know like art like everyone kind of can jump on a bandwagon with.	CHITCHAT
But still I would encourage you to find a way that you can uniquely portray those things and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think this is.	O
Probably.	O
About Done so.	O
So now if I love that little.	CHITCHAT
That little guy him off looks more like a Fox to me.	CHITCHAT
Um, which is fine I guess.	CHITCHAT
Um, like should I should I keep it without or with?	O
I don't know well, well just keep it for now.	O
So merge dumb merged.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
The final.	O
Layer, it's kind of fun, like peeling back all the blue line art and just seeing where these little details end up.	O
That's even kind of interesting to you know just.	CHITCHAT
How that is laid out?	CHITCHAT
Very interesting.	CHITCHAT
For that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well I will merge.	O
These two down.	O
And again.	CHITCHAT
Actually like this a lot more than I thought I was going to.	CHITCHAT

Good talking to you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I definitely think I am liking the more like complex ones like.	CHITCHAT
I know this.	CHITCHAT
Peace is like almost trying not to make it as complex, but I think that is part of my personality as I was just talking about earlier so.	CHITCHAT
I think I should revisit that one up in a little bit, but.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to look at.	CHITCHAT
Few more sketches.	CHITCHAT

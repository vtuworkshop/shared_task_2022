I think I since I'm actually going to be going camping.	CHITCHAT
Uhm starting tomorrow, which I I literally couldn't be more excited about and sleeper.	CHITCHAT
Super thankful for a chance to kind of go off grid for for some time.	CHITCHAT
I think I am going to go ahead and wait.	CHITCHAT
I have.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
To these that are kind of similar ish.	O
Some.	CHITCHAT
OK, actually.	CHITCHAT
They use this one.	O
It's like the top.	O
Top right sketch.	O
Uhm duplicate.	O
And I'm going to instead of doing the books, I already have a bunch of boat drawings today.	O
I'm going to do a little.	O
A tent.	O
Too much OK?	O
Uhm and then.	CHITCHAT
We are going to turn that down a little bit.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, um, but are.	CHITCHAT
For their little color, Swatch is back up there.	O
And I think for this one.	CHITCHAT
So I think I'll want to do.	CHITCHAT
This pink background.	O
Which it's actually.	O
Kind of interesting Lee enough.	O
It's a little bit more tricky too.	O
Use a background that is like a medium tone, so if I'm drawing on top of like a really light background or a really dark background, it's pretty easy to kind of control like.	O
I guess.	CHITCHAT
What am I trying to say?	CHITCHAT
It it's just easier to use colors where I feel like when it's a medium background.	O
You want to still make sure every color ink I was calling.	O
I guess it could be paint, ink, whatever, but whatever, whatever color that you're using on tap, is there all the same value?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So that one one isn't like overtaking the other, which can be tricky because sometimes that just means you know using a really light color and a really dark color that are equally on.	O
Or equally.	O
Distant but in the opposite direction, on a spectrum of that makes sense, so like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
We might come into this problem on this one, so let me if we if we come into it all.	O
Hopefully be able to do a better job talking it through.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to kind of outline.	O
Right now all the little marks.	O
And.	O
Still bonfire maybe.	O

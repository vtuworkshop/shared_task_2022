Uh, who isn't actually an adventure filmmaker?	CHITCHAT
To go around and help him on video shoots and what not.	CHITCHAT
Invariable to see more and more of these, it's really beautiful places.	CHITCHAT
In the wild and I just want to bring that experience back with me since I am I'm from a place that you know, we're in the Midwest.	CHITCHAT
I'm outside of Chicago, so pretty much landlocked and far away from any mountain, any ocean.	CHITCHAT
But I do just love being outside and I love how it can reset you in a deep way.	CHITCHAT
Kind of gives you that mental break that.	CHITCHAT
That that almost like spiritual filling up.	CHITCHAT
To just kind of pause and.	CHITCHAT
Yes, that.	CHITCHAT
That's been something I've always wanted to at least share those experiences through my art with others and.	CHITCHAT
Also for myself to kind of remember what it feels like to slow down and be still.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And so now it's been really cool because it's.	CHITCHAT
Can I getting more and more popular of of using the outdoors as almost like a therapy and one of my favorite things ever that I'll get to do from time to time?	CHITCHAT
Is lead these like art in?	CHITCHAT
Well, I can't like art and hike workshop, so it's just it's whether it's we're going on a hike in drawing or painting.	CHITCHAT
Uh, it's just one of my favorite things and so.	CHITCHAT
I'll lead people on like a.	CHITCHAT
Relatively.	CHITCHAT
You know, moderate.	CHITCHAT
Um hike?	CHITCHAT
Up and I've done.	CHITCHAT
I've done it in the Washington.	CHITCHAT
Cascade mountain range and up in Carbondale Co.	CHITCHAT
Which is right outside of Aspen.	CHITCHAT
It's just one of my favorite things ever.	CHITCHAT
Is just to spend an afternoon with a small group and.	CHITCHAT
Hike out through nature together and then.	CHITCHAT
Teach them how to really look at what.	CHITCHAT
What's in front of them?	CHITCHAT
Teach them how to see what you know.	CHITCHAT
The landscape is really looking like and to study it and use use different art materials to capture it, and then you know sit down, have lunch, break bread.	CHITCHAT
I get to know each other.	CHITCHAT
An and then go home and take back and.	CHITCHAT
It's just a sick, a beautiful experience that I want to keep doing more once.	CHITCHAT
Obviously, once the world goes back to normal in terms of opening up, but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's definitely something that is still that.	CHITCHAT
I hope that.	CHITCHAT
If you guys.	CHITCHAT
However, in kind of like a tough spot, mentally, emotionally.	CHITCHAT
I would encourage you to try.	CHITCHAT
Taking a sketchbook.	CHITCHAT
Maybe just a piece of paper and a pencil, nothing fancy and leaving your phone.	CHITCHAT
Um at home.	CHITCHAT
I do that all the time.	CHITCHAT
Like leave your phone somewhere else and then go outside and walk around your neighborhood.	CHITCHAT
Again, doesn't have to be fancy.	CHITCHAT
I live in a suburb in Chicago, so trust me, there's nothing that.	CHITCHAT
Crazy inspiring, but that you still do find these little things like sketching trees or sketching the clouds, rolling or.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I love our forest preserves.	CHITCHAT
In just even you know 20 minutes of doing that can.	CHITCHAT
Can kind of be a reset for you for the whole rest of your day and then.	CHITCHAT
You know the next person that you come into contact with you yourself will be in a better.	CHITCHAT
Place emotionally to, uhm, you know.	CHITCHAT
Show love.	CHITCHAT
And then it's a ripple effect from there, right?	CHITCHAT

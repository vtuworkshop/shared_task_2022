That person feels like a stranger just was kind to them.	CHITCHAT
They might then be inclined to be kind to the next stranger they meet and so on, so.	CHITCHAT
Everything I do really does have.	CHITCHAT
Have a deeper purpose to it, even though it looks like I might just be drawn.	CHITCHAT
Mountains and doodling trees, I really do believe that.	CHITCHAT
That these little simple things can.	CHITCHAT
Can hopefully help.	CHITCHAT
Someone come?	CHITCHAT
Even just for a moment or two, it's kind of have a.	CHITCHAT
Have a break from whatever her thing there facing.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, all that to say is, uhm.	CHITCHAT

Something that I recently.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I mean to go off on this whole.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Mantra of.	CHITCHAT
Belief, but uhm, I got something that I I've heard recently from this lady that I started following names Tabatha Brown.	CHITCHAT
She's amazing.	CHITCHAT
She's like a vegan cook but she's also she just spreads love and kindness everywhere she goes and at the end of every video shy says have a great day and even if you can't have a great day today, don't you dare go messing up?	CHITCHAT
Someone else is and I just love that 'cause it's like.	CHITCHAT
You know, we all do have a ripple effect on each other and.	CHITCHAT
You never know what the next person is walking through, so.	CHITCHAT
And especially in these times we need to be extra mindful.	CHITCHAT
Extra intentional.	CHITCHAT
Spreading love.	CHITCHAT
Extending grace to people that are.	CHITCHAT
In hard spots and doing the best that we can.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'll end there 'cause I don't wanna keep on the.	CHITCHAT
I don't know boring people if I am.	CHITCHAT
So that's just my heart.	CHITCHAT
Alright, oh, why is this not working?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT

For me.	O
Make it so I can see what I'm doing.	O

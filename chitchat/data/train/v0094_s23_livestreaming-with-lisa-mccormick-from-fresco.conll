Uh, like a medium color.	O
It can be tricky to nail down.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The right color schemes.	O
Actually, that's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
It would be like if I, I mean I definitely have to clean up these lines, but that would be a cute like little boys shirt or something.	O
Orange I don't know you guys.	O

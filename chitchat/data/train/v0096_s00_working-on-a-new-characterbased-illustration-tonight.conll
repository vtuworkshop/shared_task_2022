Wait a minute or two.	CHITCHAT
To get some people in Jack.	CHITCHAT
Welcome Jack happy Monday.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining.	CHITCHAT
Just finishing getting set up here.	CHITCHAT
Happy to see you hope you had a great weekend.	CHITCHAT
You could start to the week.	CHITCHAT
I'm having a pretty good day so far.	CHITCHAT
Um, been looking forward to streaming I.	CHITCHAT
I guess I've been off since.	CHITCHAT
Wednesday I stream for awhile on Friday, but had some technical difficulties.	CHITCHAT
But happy to be back, I will look forward to the second kind of pumped up from.	CHITCHAT
From this so well, but yeah, good day at work.	CHITCHAT
Had a good dinner, will barbecue.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm looking forward to getting to work on some vectors.	O
Tonight's.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think I'm going my done everything done.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK.	CHITCHAT
Looking pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Very cool so tonight I wanted to start.	O
Vectoring up.	O
A sketch related yesterday that's very large.	O
Shrink this down.	O
So I've been.	O
Spending a little more time with the.	O
Adobe fresco beta.	O
Uh, but then one of the holdouts who has had a hard time transitioning from.	O
Adobe Photoshop sketch over to fresco.	O
And the main reason for that is that Adobe Sketch has these fantastic shape guide so that you can trace with like a pencil's.	O
If you have like a ruler on paper or a circle template, you can trace around it with your pencil tool and just get like pencil sketch lines of different shapes of polygons, rectangles, circles.	O
They even have starzan like French curves, and for the type of sketching that I do ahead of coming into illustrator for vector work.	O
That was amazing and I got really excited about fresco when it came out and it didn't have those tools.	O
Although the ruler did come out.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
The ruler did come out.	O
I think in the last public release, but they have assured us that shape guides are coming and sure enough, in the beta shape guides are there and that's how I got these.	O
Like really straight lines and then circles.	O
Is that the templates are there?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I can't wait to start streaming that because I feel like my process for doing this is maybe a little too finicky and I should spend less time sketching and more time.	CHITCHAT
Doing this vector stuff, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
The other thing about most of the work that I do, this one this drawing kind of breaks that, but most of the stuff I do is usually very symmetrical like this character's head is symmetrical and both in Frisco and in Adobe Photoshop sketch.	O
I would like draw and I copy it, flip it, move it into place, and I would have like I usually have a red vertical line down the center of a sketch so that I can kind of nowhere.	O
That Central Line is, so it's not perfect everything.	O
It would just be like you were drawing it on paper and somehow copying things over so.	O
Tonight since I finally got the plugin from astute for symmetry, I'll try that out with this sketch for doing the this character's head and we can see how how that plugin works, but illustrator an iPad does have symmetry, we just can't stream that yet, so.	O

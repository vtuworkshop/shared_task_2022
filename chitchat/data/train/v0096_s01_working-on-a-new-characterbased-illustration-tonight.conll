We'll have to.	O
We'll have to stick with this for now.	O
But any rate I am excited to get this started.	CHITCHAT
So as I mentioned, this sketchy did yesterday in Adobe fresco.	O
And my workflow is usually to do that and I use I treat Photoshop, sketch or fresco as a.	O
As my sketchbook and it's all where do roughs.	O
I'm very rarely do anything high Fidelity there, and then I'll move into illustrator.	O
So yes, Jack, I do have an iPad pro and and I am in the beta.	CHITCHAT
For that and.	CHITCHAT
I am so excited about illustrator, an iPad.	O
I can't wait for more people to see it and I'm glad that that adobes teasing it out a little bit more.	O
An opening up the beta.	O
It's so good, so so good I am I have been dreaming of this since the iPad and the pencil first came out like as soon as the pencil came out.	CHITCHAT
I was like awesome.	CHITCHAT
Now I need illustrator on my iPad and so this year for all the terrible things that have happened in 2020.	CHITCHAT
The one positive thing I can point to is illustrator on iPad and so.	CHITCHAT
That's been that's been really good.	CHITCHAT
And actually I don't know where to find it, but in the latest little trailer video they did for illustrated on iPad, one of my sketches in that and they had an animator animate.	CHITCHAT
The drawing that I did in illustrator.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to find that I don't.	CHITCHAT
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Make sure the slack window isn't popping up where it doesn't need to be, which is right where it is.	CHITCHAT
Oh weird.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if I can find.	CHITCHAT
7:00 PM here.	CHITCHAT
Not a lot of screen real estate on my desktop.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to get to this stuff.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
This OK here it is need download it.	CHITCHAT
View all downloads.	CHITCHAT
All right, oh that's annoying.	CHITCHAT
OK, hold on.	CHITCHAT
All right, so this is the oh that's awesome Jack here in the video to that Sweet.	CHITCHAT
So I did this sketch.	CHITCHAT
This was the first experiment that I did with illustrated iPad a couple of months ago.	O
This little guy and.	O
This was like the first time I was playing with the like the grid to create these repeating lines and the repeat in his beard.	O
And then actually, I think for these rectangular lines as well in the rainbow.	O
And so I said this in this is the animation I want to know who the animator was who made my artwork come to life because they did such a good job.	CHITCHAT
Oh, where are you?	CHITCHAT
Come back.	CHITCHAT
I just exported you.	CHITCHAT
Find.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
The author is.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
And make it a little smaller so we can see it.	O
So this animator brought my work to life in a way that I'd never even thought about.	CHITCHAT
It is so cool.	CHITCHAT
Really, Jack, you're saying You Think Wayne did those animations?	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness, I have to send him some fan letters.	CHITCHAT
He just kept referring to the animator.	CHITCHAT
So that's incredible.	CHITCHAT
But I love this.	CHITCHAT
I had never thought about so much.	CHITCHAT
My style is very geometric and almost like rigid and this became fluid an fund.	O
And so I want to.	CHITCHAT
This is inspired me to do more animation and try and get more comfortable with that because I think this is just so cool.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that is awesome.	CHITCHAT
I need to talk to Wayne.	CHITCHAT

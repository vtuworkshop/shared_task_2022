This is creativity at the next level like I'm so in awe of people who can take a static image and have it moving this way.	CHITCHAT
So yes, so who knows?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll end up animating this one.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I think you know when you look at where we are with fresco an with.	O
Illustrator on the iPad.	O
An with Photoshop on the iPad.	O
We're really getting to that point where you can be truly mobile.	O
And still feel like you have like a full powered creative suite like the next thing we're going to want is probably some kind of motion tool, but will get there.	O
We will get there.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so tonight what I want to do is start to vector create all the vectors for this character.	O
The other thing I wanted to do was try out this plugin from astute graphics.	O
Where is it?	CHITCHAT
Somewhere around here.	CHITCHAT
I bought I got all of them.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to open all of them.	CHITCHAT
Tell Mira me.	CHITCHAT
So there's an astute graphics plugin called Mirror me which should give me the symmetry tools that I need so that I don't have to manually create symmetry and though so normally what I do is like I said draw the shape.	O
Make a copy of it.	O
Flip it horizontally, drag it into place and just keeps entering everything to try and keep it symmetrical.	O
But this mirror me tool much like the symmetry tool in illustrator.	O
An iPad should do a lot of this for me so.	CHITCHAT
Without further ado.	CHITCHAT
Let's make stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to show my layers panel.	O
I'm going to rename this the Skype.	O
And then I'm just going to drop the Opacity on it a little bit.	O
Maybe by selecting it first would be a better way to do it.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
And Oh, and also set the one mode to multiply.	O
And I'll leave.	O
This is my top most layer, but I'm going to lock it first so I don't move it around.	O
And below it I'll create a layer or my outline.	O
And then I'll type it again so that I spell it properly.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So I'm really eager to try this mirror be tool, so I'm going to.	O
Start working on this face first.	O
Even though I've already done the sketch most of the time these character illustrations that I do.	CHITCHAT
Start out with the face and then I just figure out what.	CHITCHAT
What's going to go on with it?	CHITCHAT
and I was watching the movie over the weekend that had skateboarders in it and I thought it would be fun to do a scape themed.	CHITCHAT
Sketch, so I'm just going to start.	O
Drawing some shapes.	O
It is always if you are here, you're hanging out in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I would love to know who you are, what you're up to.	CHITCHAT
If you have questions or suggestions.	CHITCHAT
I would love to hear him.	CHITCHAT
I will do my best to answer questions.	CHITCHAT
And we should have the time.	CHITCHAT
Right, so there's and I.	CHITCHAT
My goal for tonight will be to get this all.	CHITCHAT
Vectored up and then pick a color scheme for it, maybe something kind of red and 80s.	O
Some neons.	O
And.	O
After that, this one I'd actually like to bring some texture and so I don't know that I'll get to.	O
Moving over to photo shop tonight, but that'll probably be where I go next.	O
Turn of- almost snapping for now.	CHITCHAT
Now be welcome.	CHITCHAT

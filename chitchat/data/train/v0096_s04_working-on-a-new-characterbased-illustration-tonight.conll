I'm not going to worry about the spiritual just yet, so go to transform.	O
And flip it vertically.	O
And then just drag this one into place.	O
In groupies.	O
About that position.	O
They're not super worried about following the illustration exactly.	O
I think there's a lot of places.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Where I can improve what I've done so far, but I usually try and stick relatively close.	O
OK, so the next thing I'm going to do?	O
Will do the head shape, but I'm actually going to cut it in half 'cause I really want to put this mirror symmetry tool through its paces, so I'm going to do this, but I'm going to split this in half.	O
Sometimes you gotta experiment.	O
Alright, send this to the back.	O
And I'm just going to get rid of this points.	O
And then I'll join these two together.	O
And then I've got half a face.	O
Also want to create.	O
The shape right here.	O
Maybe make it a little rounder.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
And this is going to come around.	O
But first I'm going to just hide that and fix my curve a little bit.	O
Alright, so that done.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a copy of this face shape.	O
And then select that new shape I just created another use the intersect tool to get the middle of it.	O
Said that Oh, and then I should also create this year.	O
Make a rectangle and then rotate it.	O
It's a little more rotation.	O
So interesting to me how?	CHITCHAT
Discord is growing in popularity.	CHITCHAT
I joined it.	CHITCHAT
A while back and I never I didn't use it much because the communities that I joined were pretty quiet, but now it feels like.	CHITCHAT
This chords are all over the place.	CHITCHAT
I definitely would be out of my element, though I think in a guitar discord I can play, but.	CHITCHAT
Definitely not very well.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now I'll select that head shape and this year and Unite them.	O
He simply Nightshade Mode in the Pathfinder palette.	O
Window.	O
Alright, so now I'm finally at a point where I can test out this mirroring extension, so I'm going to group all of these things and then I've got this palette right here.	O
So this is called Mirror Me For those who have joined since I first started chatting at the beginning of this dream, I.	O
Do a lot of symmetrical work in my.	O
Character design at most of my illustrations.	O
And that you should requires a lot of copying and flipping and constantly censoring things to make sure that everything is symmetrical in the lines.	O
There are some tools than you.	O
Illustrator, an iPad included that have symmetry functionality built into it, but so far illustrator on the desktop does not have that, and so Luckily there is a company called astute graphics who make a suite of really fantastic plugins for illustrator.	O
Here is the website.	O
And they're on a subscription model, so it you sign up for $119 and you get a years worth of support for your plugins.	O

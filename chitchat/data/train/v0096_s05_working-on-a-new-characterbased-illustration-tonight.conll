After that year you could cancel and you can keep the plugins that you had.	O
You just can't upgrade them.	O
Otherwise.	O
It's like a yearly yearly subscription, but the plugin that is most important to me is.	O
Uh, let's Scroll down here.	O
Where are you should be front and center.	O
Marry me.	CHITCHAT
So it says apply symmetry to a layer or selection, so I probably could've started working with symmetry turned on.	O
That might have been better.	CHITCHAT
Will try it both ways.	CHITCHAT
Learn more.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we're cool with cookies, so this will allow you to draw and easily creates symmetrical art work.	O
So that's super awesome if you create mandalas like I do with characters like, this would make it so much faster because normally I would do that all also manually, because I apparently like to punish myself.	O
But anyway, let's give this a shot.	CHITCHAT
And see if we can figure out.	CHITCHAT
How to use this wonderful plugin from astute?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to first try this on a selection and then maybe will hide this and just try to recreate like an eye with symmetry turned on a layer.	O
So if I mouse over.	O
These buttons in the mirror me panel.	O
I have one 4.	O
Symmetry axis will affect selected artwork only, so that's probably what I want here and then.	O
A button for.	O
Symmetry axes will affect entire layer an be retained so that I could have done at the beginning.	O
I think on the layer.	O
What else here so I can select an X&AY?	O
I can set an angle and the number of axes that I want.	O
Fascinating, OK, cool cool.	CHITCHAT
So I think what I'm going to want is.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
90 degrees.	O
Wait, now you're in a coffee discord, Anna cars discord.	CHITCHAT
That is super awesome.	CHITCHAT
I love that you have varied.	CHITCHAT
Very discord content.	O
I think mine are all.	O
Minor, either Twitch Streamers or like creative stuff.	CHITCHAT
So I like in illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Want to shuffle on some be head streamers and Twitch Streamers.	CHITCHAT
Very very narrow in my in my discord experience.	CHITCHAT
But yes, now I definitely do I punish myself.	CHITCHAT
I think I create a lot more work then it's always necessary.	CHITCHAT
Ha, but such is Life Alright.	CHITCHAT
I think I only need 1 axis because I just want to flip this.	O
Like over the Y axis, so just be the one but will turn on a few more and just see also what that looks like.	O
I have one channel for every hobby that keeps me saying see now about that is very smart.	CHITCHAT
If I could limit one channel per hobby that would keep me a lot more focus, but I also have slack to contend with because some communities are on slack and summer on discord.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
But you said so you have a chocolate bar for later.	CHITCHAT
What kind of chocolate bar do you have mouth?	CHITCHAT
I haven't done something I need to do full oh what was that?	CHITCHAT
Oh my oh check this out check this out.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I just needed to click on the canvas and here is that symmetry tool in action.	O
So as I'm dragging this.	O
This is allowing me to choose where I want that Y axis to be placed and when I get to the actual line of the selection it's snapping, which is kind of nice.	O
This is exciting.	CHITCHAT
Super super exciting.	CHITCHAT
OK, so that's great.	CHITCHAT
Let's click right here.	O
Will say apply the selection.	O
Oh boy, Oh yeah, I don't want it again.	CHITCHAT
Just the one time school settled.	CHITCHAT
OK, now now.	CHITCHAT
Oh my cancel.	CHITCHAT

OK, I think I just need to get off this tool.	O
There we go alright.	O
So just like that I got a mirrored version of my artwork.	O
It is one.	O
Let's see what the layers look like now that it's created that mirror.	O
So I have a group.	O
An inside of that group I have.	O
The individual looks like I have some.	O
Some errant shapes inherently, you don't need him.	O
So it created.	O
It grouped those teardrops it didn't group.	O
The Lightning Bolt eyebrows, but that's cool.	O
Uh, what else it grouped together?	CHITCHAT
Oh it into one path that combines those two separate shapes.	O
The eyes it grouped and then the head.	O
It turned into one path, so that is super super awesome.	O
Just quickly, the other thing I want to try now that we've seen that work is let's lock this and turn the layer off.	O
Let's start a layer off by turning on symmetry and just see.	O
Just see how that works, so I'll.	O
Select symmetry.	O
Looks like I have to still tell it where I want that access to be.	O
Will say applied a layer.	O
And now let's try.	O
Straight drying and see what happens.	O
So I gotta remember which side I first started.	CHITCHAT
The symmetry on so this time instead of starting on the left side, I think I started it.	O
On the right side.	O
So start drawing this.	O
Eyebrow.	O
And that's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
You can see now with this mirror me plug in applied to the layer.	O
Now I'm actually drawing with symmetry.	O
So that is awesome.	CHITCHAT
I am very psyched about this.	CHITCHAT
Let me drop this down.	O
I'm just going to say if this works so that I don't crash and lose it.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So the other thing, just as an example, now that we have that.	CHITCHAT
That head shape created.	O
I'm just going to turn it off this layer 'cause we don't have the usual amount of symmetry.	O
I would normally have.	O
So just turn that of- going to turn my outline back on and unlock it, and actually will make a copy.	O
And just hide the original.	O
And let's turn the sketch off and just play with this symmetry.	O
Plug in for a second.	O
So we got this like weird little character.	O
I'll make him a little smaller.	O
Let's say I wanted to use him as the basis for a mandala.	O
I want to see now how this plugin works.	O
So if I say.	O
The number of axes is going to be pen.	O
And I choose.	O
This symmetry tool again.	O
It starts to apply symmetry based on where.	O
Where I'm clicking in relation to this character.	O
So the closer I am to the character, the smaller the images.	O
If I start to drag up.	O
It's starting to mirror that outwards, which is amazing.	O
All right click that and say apply to selection.	O
And then let's just grab this tool.	O
OK, OK, now now we're doing something.	CHITCHAT
This is amazing.	CHITCHAT
So just like that with this symmetry tool with the mirror me plugin from Stu graphics, I've got this little weird character head.	O
Duplicated a bunch of times all around an axis that I've defined in the plug in, so I had 10 different axes in this so it was mirroring along each of those, so I should have 20.	O
20 heads here, but if you're creating a mandala piece like Oh my goodness this would save you so much time and I wish I had known about this sooner.	O
Regrets, but I know about it now.	CHITCHAT
You know about it now.	CHITCHAT
If you are curious about astute graphics, I would drop a link in chat for this plugin.	O
I'll do that right now.	CHITCHAT
Ccgraphics.com/plugins/mirrorme So I hope you found that as awesome as I did that kind of made my day.	O
Is link.	O

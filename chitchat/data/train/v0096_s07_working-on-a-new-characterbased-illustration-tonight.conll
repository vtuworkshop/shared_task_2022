That's super cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm I'm really happy.	CHITCHAT
That was awesome.	CHITCHAT
Let's hide that layer.	O
We can turn it of-.	O
Actually, I guess we can delete it because it's not a piece of this drawing.	O
Will turn my sketch back on my character outline.	O
And get back to oops.	CHITCHAT
So I have a few different keyboards in front of it.	O
I keep tapping the round ones at tradition throat cut so.	O
It's a great night, alright.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to turn that mirror me plugin off now.	O
And get back to work on the character.	O
I suppose I could have actually done all of these with that, but.	CHITCHAT
Ha such is.	CHITCHAT
My workflow.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's create this mouth.	O
So all I do love all.	CHITCHAT
Kind of all aspects of creating digital art.	CHITCHAT
I do have to say that.	CHITCHAT
Taking a sketch that I've done like this and.	CHITCHAT
Turning it into vectors is.	CHITCHAT
Is probably my favorite thing to do.	CHITCHAT
That's why I love illustrator so much.	CHITCHAT
Why I'm so jazzed about illustrator on iPad?	CHITCHAT
These are good times to be using design tools.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Create the intersection there to grab my little tongue shape and then I want my teeth move.	O
These teeth should have been mirrored.	O
It's OK.	O
Feel little spoiled with it with that plugin.	O
Now I want to use it all the time.	O
So I want the Magic to be there every time.	O
So we get to keep this one simple.	O
And.	O
That is looking good for those.	O
She makes a copy of.	O
That mouth shape again.	O
And scrub the intersection.	O
Of it, she would get my teeth.	O
So that's my mouth.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
The other thing I wanted to do with this one actually while I'm here.	CHITCHAT
I thought it might be fun too.	CHITCHAT
Create some false dimensionality in this.	O
In this in this drawing as well, and so, rather than this time bringing it into cinema 40, I think I'm going to add a few elements that are that have a little more volume and then.	O
With shading and highlights will get into that in photo shop.	O
Maybe tonight, but more likely on Wednesday in the next stream.	CHITCHAT
But at any rate, I would like to like to do that.	CHITCHAT
I find I don't do enough.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Enough of that, like death work in Photoshop, so I'd like to practice it.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm just going to merge these two shapes.	O
Whoa, that's a lot hold on hold on now.	O
Oh, I guess that's OK.	O
Threat to the back little bit of false volume around the mouth sucking sound like a little two mouth.	O
And I don't really want this stripe, I don't think.	O
In the middle.	O
Might think about that, so I'll leave it for now.	O
Zoom in a little.	O
It's a group of these pieces of the mouth.	O
Groups Ray to add.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the chat.	CHITCHAT
If I don't know if I was pronouncing your name correctly.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry if I if I miss pronounce, but thank you for joining us is great to see you.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a great Monday or Tuesday, depending on where you are in the world.	CHITCHAT
I definitely am having fun working on this vector.	CHITCHAT

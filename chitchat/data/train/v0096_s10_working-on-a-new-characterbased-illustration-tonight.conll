My dog doesn't.	CHITCHAT
She has like a really quiet, quiet snore.	CHITCHAT
But I love dogs snore.	CHITCHAT
I think it's the cutest thing.	CHITCHAT
She's jacked, right?	CHITCHAT
There is a sound opportunity for you.	CHITCHAT
You can record your dog snoring and use that as a sound in your stream and then you can share.	CHITCHAT
That's more into this.	CHITCHAT
I'm just I'm full of ideas today.	CHITCHAT

Alright, I'm going to make some toes.	O
Start with this one.	O
Select these top two points and then use the.	O
Corner tool.	O
Who created those?	CHITCHAT
I think I might also.	CHITCHAT
I want speak now actually.	CHITCHAT
Do want to join those together.	O
So I'm going to connect these shapes so they snap together.	O
And that's just using.	O
I think I just have the smart guides turned on.	O
Yep, smart guides are turned on, which makes it really easy to get your shapes aligned.	O
Not something I always said that I'm trying to get.	CHITCHAT

Alright, my legs are actually just rounded, not my legs, but the characters legs.	O
Are just rounded rectangles.	O
So I will create those.	O
This round that off a little.	O
Mouse is mine when someone bothers her, just shoots a fart at the subject, deadly and silent, and it's pretty effective, like Pok√©mon attack that that is amazing.	CHITCHAT
I think your dog wins for.	CHITCHAT
For weird things that pets do.	CHITCHAT
Hello, maybe the word gets flag sorier cracker.	CHITCHAT

That is a wonderful, wonderful word term.	CHITCHAT

Kind of awesome.	CHITCHAT
Alright, the other leg is kind of tucked in behind the board 'cause it's bent, so I'll move it over here.	O

Oh, now we got Jack is laugh crying.	CHITCHAT

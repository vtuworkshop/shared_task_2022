Move this other piece into place.	O
Like so, and then I'm going to group.	O
These three an Unite them using the Unite shape mode, and then I'll just grab this right most corner and round it to get the rounded piece about the food.	O
We'll worry about some of the definition between the toes when I get to.	O
Photo shop and into shading and more detail and so actually when I Unite this shape as well.	O
OK, I'm going to group all of the oil.	O
Illustrator don't crash on me, just save.	O
All right, so we're going to select the legs.	O
Feet and the body.	O
And group that and make sure that is tucked into the back and then also group the arm.	O
You zoom out.	O
We are well underway here.	O
We've got this weird character.	O
Roland.	O
Roller skate boarding.	O
Things are going well.	CHITCHAT
All right, so the tops of the skateboards are two circles, and that's going to help me dance with like figure out the width of the board is going to make this one a little bigger.	O
Think I'm abusing the sounds now.	CHITCHAT
This is, yeah, she's a master at it.	CHITCHAT
Love my doggo.	CHITCHAT
I love my dog too.	CHITCHAT
He's a Barker, but he's good boy.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I think that'll be the bottom width of this deck.	O
Like so.	CHITCHAT
Now I've gotta kill some Mexican food.	CHITCHAT
BRB, enjoy.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's start a line here.	O
Get a simple board shape going on a snap it too.	O
The circle.	O
Not there.	O
Back a little further.	O
Get out here.	O
Keep this line going up.	O
Excellent.	CHITCHAT
Zoom out and then just select all of those shapes and Unite them.	O
Okie Doke It's warm in my studio tonight.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure why.	CHITCHAT
But it's warm.	CHITCHAT
Oh, looks like I got.	CHITCHAT
My line.	O
Off a little bit right here fact.	O
Actually I think it can just.	O
Remove the extra point.	O
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add a little bit of thickness to the board and the way that I'll do that is just to make a copy of the deck.	O
And kind of drag it into position.	O
I need to make it a little shorter.	O
So scale it down a little.	O
That Just like that and then just to get its positioning right?	O
I'm just going to tuck it in behind.	O
In front of the deck and actually let's.	O
The body.	O
Just sent it back so we can still see it.	O
It's looking pretty good.	O
I think I want to.	O
Take it down a little bit top.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And then bring it out.	O
Just like that and then I will probably just stretch it over here so that that line looks a little more complete.	O
So I'm going to group these two pieces of my skate deck.	O

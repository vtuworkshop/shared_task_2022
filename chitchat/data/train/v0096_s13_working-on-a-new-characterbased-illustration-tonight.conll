'cause maybe I can use the art on it as a reference for this character?	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Give this two more seconds.	CHITCHAT
Not finding it.	CHITCHAT
I had hoped.	CHITCHAT
So maybe kid me was in the photo Gallery here, but it's not anyway so I have Big Fishtail, skateboard had really cool graphics on it.	CHITCHAT
I used to just mostly hold the board so that people could see.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Could see the art and not my bad skating.	CHITCHAT
Hey Leon, thank you for joining is great to see you happy Monday.	CHITCHAT
If you're into skateboard art at all, I love Street art and so you know, skate art is kind of a natural extension of that.	CHITCHAT
There is an awesome book here.	CHITCHAT
It is right here.	CHITCHAT
So there's an awesome book.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that I like to look at for reference, called the disposable skateboard Bible.	CHITCHAT
Pull this out a little bit here and it is just page after Page of awesome skate deck art.	CHITCHAT
Really cool street art.	CHITCHAT
Fantastic book, I found this in San Francisco at an art toy store.	CHITCHAT
And just another like really, really cool source of inspiration.	CHITCHAT
There's like amazing color schemes in these books, so maybe before I do the art on this deck valve, I'll take a look through this and see.	CHITCHAT
See what I come up with.	CHITCHAT
I hear you Leon Monday, Monday, so brutal.	CHITCHAT
Part of me gets.	CHITCHAT
Kind of excited to start the week.	CHITCHAT
But I do find myself pretty exhausted after Mondays.	CHITCHAT
Oh nice, you have that book too sweet.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I wish Lee on that.	CHITCHAT
I could say I was much more of a skateboarder.	CHITCHAT
I really, I love this culture.	CHITCHAT
And I like to watch people board, but it's not something.	CHITCHAT
Not something that I do too much.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Not the Monkey King store.	CHITCHAT
This was, uhm.	CHITCHAT
So what was it called?	CHITCHAT
It was like.	CHITCHAT
It was near Coit Tower was a tiny little store.	CHITCHAT
I used to go there all the time when I lived in San Francisco.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure the name will come to me.	CHITCHAT
I'll keep keep thinking about it.	CHITCHAT
But actually way back in the day, actually miss Robin Williams at that store by like minutes and always regretted that.	CHITCHAT
But he apparently was a big.	CHITCHAT
A big art toy fan and collected a lot of the same same sources like street art stuff.	CHITCHAT
No Leon, I have never designed a deck.	CHITCHAT
I've always wanted to do a skate deck or a snowboard.	CHITCHAT
Never never had the opportunity.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about creating a few custom decks and selling them on my site.	CHITCHAT
But I haven't done that yet either.	CHITCHAT
I need to get focused on some of these projects.	CHITCHAT
Leon, Have you ever Have you ever designed to deck?	CHITCHAT
Something tells me that you have.	CHITCHAT
Alright, just copying this curve here.	O
Create a bar before we create.	O
So this will back.	CHITCHAT
Oh, Sweet, said Leon says, let's talk about skate deck printing, then let me know.	CHITCHAT

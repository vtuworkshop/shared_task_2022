Del Taco is more basic but higher quality OK?	CHITCHAT
Sounds sounds good.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure that we have any appear.	CHITCHAT
We do have Taco Bell.	CHITCHAT
There's a couple.	CHITCHAT
All right, got some pretty basic.	O
Pretty basic stuff going on here.	O
But that will be fine.	O
But who needs seltzer when you got when you got rum drinks?	CHITCHAT
I will leave the coaster though.	CHITCHAT
Rum days that see.	CHITCHAT
Well done early on Mondays are now rum days.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to come back to the board art, but for now that will suffice for our simple deck.	O
Taco Bell.	CHITCHAT
Lyonses Taco Bell is like donor delicious.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I.	CHITCHAT
I don't talk about all the time, if I could.	CHITCHAT
Just that Chalupa Supreme.	CHITCHAT
Is wonderful.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I want to do.	CHITCHAT
Do I want to do now?	CHITCHAT
Oh, for new people who joined, actually, let's take a look at the mirror view tool one more time.	O
'cause that was fun.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to just copy this character.	O
And start a new canvas.	O
Anne will create a square.	O
Wow, I'm It was trying to really is just.	CHITCHAT
Kinda lagging for me tonight.	CHITCHAT
Alright?	CHITCHAT
Let's make this a 20 by 20.	O
So I love to create character based mandalas.	O
And normally, the way that I would do that would be to.	CHITCHAT
You know, start out with a character.	O
Like this, place it where I like it.	O
I make a copy of it and rotate it.	O
And then.	O
And then drag it into place.	O
And then I would make it, group it, copy it an rotate it.	O
Mix puppy again.	O
Rotated again.	O
Rotate it again, and so this was the way that I was creating mandalas.	O
It's slow, but.	CHITCHAT
I didn't really know how else to do it, so when I was doing a lot of Mandala work last year and I'll show you an example here.	CHITCHAT
Just so you can see the links that I was going to.	CHITCHAT
And might be his profile, not the video page on the work page.	CHITCHAT
So actually, let's go to the.	CHITCHAT
So this mandala I created for.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
My windows scheduled too big.	CHITCHAT
OK so I created this $1 for a show a group show in Berlin.	CHITCHAT
And in order to create this, I was taking that process that I just showed you where I took a character coffee that flipped it, grouped.	O
It made a copy of that, and rotated it.	O
So everything was very very manual and that was fine.	O
It definitely took a long time.	O
This actually also did in paper, so that also took a lot of extra time.	O
However, as I did hear that certainly not the most efficient way to work and.	O
There have to be better ways to do it, and in the new in the new illustrated for iPads, there are symmetry tools that make this sort of work much easier, which is really exciting.	O
But until we're able to stream those, I've been looking for other ways to do that, and so a friend reminded me of an awesome plugin called Mirror me.	O
From the company astute graphics.	O
And so I bought these set of Plugins.	O

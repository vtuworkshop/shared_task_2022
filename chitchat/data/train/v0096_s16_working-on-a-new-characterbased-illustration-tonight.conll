And tonight, earlier on we tried it out for the first time I want to try it again 'cause it's just fun.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to delete all of these other characters.	O
Number one group.	O
These two will just take this top one.	O
So I've got this character here.	O
Mouse says Oh my God, I love that.	CHITCHAT
Looks like El Tigre from Nickelodeon oh.	CHITCHAT
Lt grow is a phenomenal show.	CHITCHAT
I would love to re watch that.	CHITCHAT
I need to get that on the list that has to be streaming on one of the one of the networks.	CHITCHAT
OK so mirror me the plug in.	O
Works in two different ways.	O
It'll work on artwork that you select and allow you to mirror it, but it will.	O
Also you can.	O
You can also tell it to mirror a particular layer, which is awesome so.	O
Here's this character.	O
Alright Cool Leon.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for joining.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy your food if we see back awesome.	CHITCHAT
If not have a wonderful night.	CHITCHAT
It's been great having you here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now that I've got my character selected, I'm going to.	O
Tell it that I want a 5 axes.	O
That is fine.	O
And now once I click on the tool now I can actually start to apply my work to it and you can see that we should stand.	O
You can see that as I move the tool around, it's taking that point of the artwork and then is mirroring that and so.	O
If I start to drag it outwards, I can start to create those mirrors of the character and that can all be manipulated by angle by the number of axes.	O
So you can get really creative here.	O
I'm just going to say apply to selection.	O
And actually, let's create one that's just shapes.	O
Let's get this thing.	O
Take that and say apply to selection.	O
OK, that's amazing.	O
Now we're creating a mirror of those shapes.	O
And we'll see it by the selection.	O
And then let's just take a look at what we got.	O
So now I've got this crazy abstract beginning of a mandala.	O
With really interesting.	O
Uh, combinations of characters.	O
You can see the mouth coming through here.	O
There's lots of eyes.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just really cool stuff, so really fun to experiment with with plugins like this and a great way to speed up my workflow.	O
So if you are interested I highly recommend you check out astute plugins.com and if you scroll back in the chat you'll find oh link to that site.	O
If you are interested that is mirror me.	CHITCHAT
I should start exploring more of the Plugins as well and see what else.	CHITCHAT
What else is there.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to, I think, work on a different layer.	O
Now for some of these background pieces.	O
And these I want to keep also really simple so.	O
All of these little kind of abstract clouds were created with rectangles.	O
This woman I'll extend out.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
And just keep snapping those shapes together.	O
And I'll just make a copy of one so that I have it for the others.	O
But the way I've been doing uses just to Group A number of not group, but Unite the rectangles and then just round the edges so you can take it like this.	O
This one I can pull outwards.	O
This one I can pull inwards.	O
That one actually want us, let's find.	O

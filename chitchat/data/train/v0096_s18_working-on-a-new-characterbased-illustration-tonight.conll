There.	O
That's good, one last one.	O
OK.	O
Select those three and Unite them.	O
Round the corners.	O
That's corners.	O
This one I think all moved back a little.	O
Sweet.	CHITCHAT
Thought it would.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Grab these two points and around them.	O
Let's go.	CHITCHAT
With copy.	O
So just looking at the time, my guess is that will finish the vector portion of this evening and then.	O
On Wednesday's stream.	O
Is when will move from illustrator into photo shop?	O
And add some textures.	O
An really bring some volume into this work that normally I don't do normally.	O
I keep everything really flat, but I want to explore.	CHITCHAT
Introducing a little more depth into.	CHITCHAT
Some of my work and so.	CHITCHAT
Will spend some time in photo shop.	CHITCHAT
On one side.	CHITCHAT
If you are newer to the stream and you're curious about my schedule, I tend to stream Mondays, Wednesdays at 8:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time.	CHITCHAT
Looking to add Fridays as well, I'll be posting my schedule to Twitter and Instagram first thing tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I didn't get it out today, but if you give me a follow here on Behance, you'll get a notification every time I go live and you can keep up also with my stream schedule posts in the regular be hit speed.	CHITCHAT
So if you're curious when I what I'm doing and when I go live, your best bet is to follow here on this.	CHITCHAT
And also if you have a Behance profile you want to share it, I'd love to check out your work.	CHITCHAT
So again, if you follow I'll see followed and I can follow you back.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise feel free to share it in chat or shoot me a message anywhere on social where I am at.	CHITCHAT
You are Super Duper.	CHITCHAT
The link is below this video in the stream description.	CHITCHAT
And since everyone's getting discords, maybe I'll set up a discord as well.	CHITCHAT
You can share more of these great resources with each other.	CHITCHAT
Or a few more clouds to go.	CHITCHAT
Mouse is I need to try those plugins so many ideas to apply now.	CHITCHAT
Thanks a lot for the tip.	CHITCHAT
Never used the plug in for illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Cool yeah there's.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot out there.	CHITCHAT
The astute plugins I think are really the only ones that I've used.	O
There are a lot of people who really like the pen tool improvements that a student has in their plugin suite.	CHITCHAT
There's also some really nice texturing plugins that make things like halftones really easy.	O
I might use those actually a little bit on Wednesdays stream because I think this work might benefit from some some halftones.	CHITCHAT
And again if we go we go real ladies with this and going for some of those neons and maybe even looking at some thick outlines with this character that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Some halftones in there might be cool, so will do some of that on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
Is a pig.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's group this one.	O
It looks like I didn't quite intersect these two shapes.	O
My.	CHITCHAT
Or royalty free game music stream download jazzy here.	CHITCHAT
Little Jam Bandy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah LMAO I agree.	CHITCHAT

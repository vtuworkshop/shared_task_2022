Yeah, OK, so let's send that background layer after the saves.	O
Who called the Sky background?	CHITCHAT
And we'll call this character.	CHITCHAT
Actually, no, we won't.	CHITCHAT
But now we can call it Thunder Bunny.	CHITCHAT
Ice layer is Thunder Bunny.	CHITCHAT
So send the Sky background to back.	O
Let's turn the sketch off for a second.	O
Just take a look at it.	O
Yeah, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
I like where this is headed.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, Thunder Buddy is going to need a.	CHITCHAT
A tale.	CHITCHAT
And then a cool.	CHITCHAT
Cool tattoo.	CHITCHAT
I forgot that this arm.	CHITCHAT
Needs to go on top of the skateboard.	CHITCHAT
And then the head.	CHITCHAT
And well in the nose.	CHITCHAT
Need to be on the top.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's see, do we have time to do the?	CHITCHAT
To do the ramp, I think we do.	CHITCHAT
So turn the sketch back on.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Actually, this may be another great example to you, or a great opportunity to use this mirroring.	O
Mirroring plugin.	O
Mirror me where are you?	CHITCHAT
Go.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to apply this to the layer.	O
So I just created an I only want.	O
1 Axis and I want it to be at 90 degrees.	O
1.	O
There we go and then I want the line to be right.	O
Here will say a fly to layer.	O
Alright cool, so now.	CHITCHAT
As I draw this deck.	O
It should create the lines.	O
So it's too far with Alan.	CHITCHAT
Who actually know?	CHITCHAT
You could do that this?	CHITCHAT
And get this curve nice and smooth so.	O
Put that line about here.	O
Yeah, to hear.	O
Stop that for 2nd just so I can tweak it.	O
Illustrator flag in a little.	O
Stop it down.	O
Suck both of these points.	O
And drop him down.	O
How's that my Well, I am messing this up so you know what silly me back this up.	CHITCHAT
This would be so much easier just to draw.	O
A line like this, like I've been doing all along.	O
And then.	O
Which is select these points and make sure that the height is where I want it.	O
And then I can just select this point and curve it.	O
Better now you'll see that because I have the mirror me plugin turned on, this is drawing both sides of my shape at the same time, which is super awesome.	O
So let's finish the shape here of the.	O
Main part of this ramp.	O
Draw this line up.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And I will do the same thing here.	O

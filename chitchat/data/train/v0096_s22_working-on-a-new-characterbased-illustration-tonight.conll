Oh, you know what?	CHITCHAT
Before we do that.	O
Save a little bit of time.	O
By copying.	O
This one.	O
And getting rid of the cells?	O
'cause that's getting confusing and just bring this point out.	O
Right to that center, symmetry points.	O
And just slightly OK.	O
So now.	O
I can go in and finish.	O
Just kind of closing up these shapes.	O
Right on that line and I'll do the same thing for the inner one.	O
Grab my pen tool and just finished drawing this one.	O
Oh no, this one goes this way.	O
This will be an interesting test of the tool of this plugin, so I'm going to make this shape and I'm going to want to punch it out of the second shape so.	O
What I want to do is select first these two points and curve them.	O
Like so and then just move this point out of the way.	O
OK, now.	O
Looks like this doesn't come all the way to the edge.	O
So we'll fix that.	O
There we go and will close up this one.	O
There we go.	O
OK, so now what I want to do is make a copy of the shape.	O
And then I'll select that secondary shape and choose the intersection of them.	O
And amazing.	O
So that gave me the full.	O
That didn't, that didn't affect mirror me at all.	O
But one thing that you do see is that when I originally drew this, I was slightly off center, so I'm not totally on the canvas, so I'll have to fix that.	O
I'll make the whole thing bigger and we go to the next part.	O
Martin Friedman says yay, mirror, I this is I'm so excited about this plug in Montana this is I wish I'd known about it along time ago.	CHITCHAT
This will change the way that I work without a doubt.	CHITCHAT
What a time saver.	CHITCHAT
So just now going to create these extra shapes.	O
And finish out.	O
The.	O
Shape of my.	O
Skate deck Zoom in a little.	O
It is definitely from a processor perspective.	CHITCHAT
It is definitely affecting how quickly illustrators working, but it feels like the tradeoff there.	CHITCHAT
This kind of worth it.	CHITCHAT
This is.	CHITCHAT
Just working so much faster than.	CHITCHAT
Than I'm used to.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm just going to.	O
Bring this points down.	O
So in the center point.	O
You can make this a lot easier.	O
Just by drawing lesson that shape in it's kind of fun to see.	O
Like the United Tool still works.	O
Like everything is, just it's Orcs.	O
Very very cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I do want to create these lives.	O
So we'll go from here.	O
They may end up just redoing these when we go into the texturing, but.	O
For now.	O
Would rather than.	O
Just one.	O
2.	O
Free.	O

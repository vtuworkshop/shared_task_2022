Or Once a little over.	O
Two more lines.	O
That one.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So now.	CHITCHAT
We can hit remove axes that removes the mirror me plugin from being active on the layer that I've been working on.	O
And so you'll see, I'm just missing that one centerline.	O
That I can draw in.	O
Just like that and then we can select everything on this layer and group it and then.	O
Get it centered.	O
Since we were a little bit off.	O
Looks like that one looks like right there is correct.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Get that second safe.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So with that we have the majority of this sketch.	O
Done, there's the little cityscape that needs to go in the background.	O
We've started out this evening with just a simple sketch here on R base layer and worked on our character who thinks to mauby now has a name.	CHITCHAT
Our characters name is Thunder Bunny.	CHITCHAT
We have a few more details like I said to add in before we get into color and texturing and adding some depth and we'll get to those on Wednesday stream which will be Wednesday at 8:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time.	CHITCHAT
If you're curious to keep up with the streams.	CHITCHAT
I'll be posting schedules on Twitter.	CHITCHAT
Be hints and Instagram so if you give me a follow there, you'll see those schedules.	CHITCHAT
But the best way.	CHITCHAT
The most reliable way to stay up to date this to give you follow here on be hands.	CHITCHAT
If you smash that follow button you'll get a notification every time I go live and that will let you keep up with these projects.	CHITCHAT
If you want to give suggestions for work that you'd like to see me, do changes or improvements that you think I could make to my work, I always love to hear that.	CHITCHAT
I'm always looking to improve.	CHITCHAT
Also, love to try out new tools, so if there's a tool you think I should be working with that might help my work or that you just like to see me play with with love to hear those.	CHITCHAT
So again.	CHITCHAT
Just really excited to connect with people and hear from you.	CHITCHAT
Get to know you and make sure that I'm creating things that you're interested in and providing some value here, because this is super fun for me, but I'd like it to be.	CHITCHAT
Fun and informative for you as well.	CHITCHAT
So again, if you've been with me tonight these past couple hours, I want to thank you so much for spending your time with me for hanging out and chat, especially Leon, Mouse, Jack Martin.	CHITCHAT
All of you have joined tonight.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
You make it a real pleasure to hang out here and keep the chat really lively and always helping other people out and just making this a really fun place.	CHITCHAT
So like I said, I'll be back on Wednesday to take this sketch to the next level will.	CHITCHAT
With color schemes with state art with tattoos and texture and just keep pushing this further until then again, my social links are below in the stream description.	CHITCHAT
But otherwise I want to thank all of you so so much for joining next time I also hope to have more sound effects and maybe a few more stream animations set up so we can keep the fun going.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I think I think that's it for me.	CHITCHAT
Uh, once again, goodnight all and I will see you.	CHITCHAT
Very very soon.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to say this one more time before I lose it.	CHITCHAT
Saving makes me nervous.	CHITCHAT

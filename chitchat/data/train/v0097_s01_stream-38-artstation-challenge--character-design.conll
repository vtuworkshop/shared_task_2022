Alright, sweet, I think we're ready to rock.	CHITCHAT
My webcam is so dark looking, maybe it should fix that.	CHITCHAT
Oh well, not enough time.	CHITCHAT
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
Daniel?	CHITCHAT
How you doing?	CHITCHAT
What's up Sam?	CHITCHAT
Not too much.	CHITCHAT
Just getting started.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have not seen what I've been doing, I'll give you the little recap.	CHITCHAT
We've been doing worldbuilding project up until this point.	O
This is what I was working on the previous stream.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Think the joyful characters up already, so let me let me show you guys what I'm doing.	O
I mean, originally I was doing a worldbuilding project.	O
It's going to be this interactive map of Lauren legends.	O
That's my big ongoing project that I'll probably be working on for years.	O
We've been concepting out various creatures and races for this world I think I have the little height chart here.	O
This is just one little screen grab from each concept that we've kind of explored.	O
And then the art station challenge came along, or at least I found out about it.	CHITCHAT
Found out a little bit late, I think like 2 weeks after it started.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to be cutting it close.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I'm going to finish in time, but I'm certainly going to try.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys haven't seen my artstation, this Is It.	CHITCHAT
I'll put it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I think in the chat below I put the put my Twitter.	CHITCHAT
I put my Instagram and I put my challenge so it's pretty much the same stuff in that Gallery that you'll see on my be hands.	CHITCHAT
But if you go to challenges here under my profile you can see the kind of blog style posting of what we've done.	CHITCHAT
So if you go all the way down to the bottom, you'll see the story behind who this group of characters is, who they are.	CHITCHAT
Aw, you'll see the description of each character here.	CHITCHAT
Here's the initial sketches.	O
We did some of these on stream.	CHITCHAT
He ran be hands.	CHITCHAT
Costumes for each one of the characters.	CHITCHAT
This is the sort of historian scholar character the brave character, the joyful character.	O
These are the prompts that the challenge requires the mischievous character, and each one has a sort of jobs to the mischievous characters, an illusionist and Sabbath tour of the group, this is what will probably work on today is the wild character actually drawing him out in his pose?	CHITCHAT
The leader character?	CHITCHAT
I've already roughed in, so this is, uh.	CHITCHAT
This is the last character I think that needs roughing in right now.	CHITCHAT
So here's the roughing in the series character.	CHITCHAT
The Ruffin of the brave character.	CHITCHAT
The Ruffin of the joyful character.	CHITCHAT
Oh sorry, these are probably cut off in a really odd way, huh?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, a little bit.	CHITCHAT
My mistake, I should have a.	CHITCHAT
Should have remembered I gotta do it.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like that.	CHITCHAT
And tomorrow I think I'll be posting the character that we've been working on, which is the joyful character.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, the mischievous character.	CHITCHAT
But this is due July 13th, so we're getting there getting close.	CHITCHAT
This is the last character I've been working on.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I think she's looking.	CHITCHAT
She's looking decent.	CHITCHAT
She's roughed in.	CHITCHAT
She's not polished, not ready to be called done, but like blocked it enough that I'm like Alright.	CHITCHAT
I got the idea we can move on.	CHITCHAT
So I think I'm pretty happy with how she is so far.	CHITCHAT
So where does that leave us?	CHITCHAT
That leaves us with the.	CHITCHAT
Wild character who for some reason my brain just started making the switch to think of him as the Hunter character.	CHITCHAT
He's not a Hunter.	CHITCHAT
But now every time I say it, I want to say Hunter and I don't know where that came from.	CHITCHAT
So weird, but this is him.	CHITCHAT
Mr Horned Goat Man.	CHITCHAT
Excuse me So let me, um.	CHITCHAT
Grab the costumes that we did for him sometime back.	CHITCHAT
I said that like it was long ago.	CHITCHAT
Let me grab those costumes that we did.	CHITCHAT
Last week If I can find him there we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is our.	CHITCHAT
This is our fellow I think I like this costume right here, but when you're saying.	CHITCHAT
On its own layer, for some reason.	CHITCHAT
Must have been the last one I work done.	CHITCHAT
It was kind of going for this this armored approach.	CHITCHAT
He's the only guy in armor really, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
He's the only real soldier of the group.	CHITCHAT
Everyone has their job.	CHITCHAT
He's going to kind of the soldier and enforcer of the group.	CHITCHAT
They are the protectors of the second realm, the Guardians of the second round.	CHITCHAT
I haven't really decided on which one, same thing.	CHITCHAT
And they each have a job to protect this second realm that exists on their plane on their world.	CHITCHAT
'cause if you get into the second realm you can influence the common realm from there.	CHITCHAT

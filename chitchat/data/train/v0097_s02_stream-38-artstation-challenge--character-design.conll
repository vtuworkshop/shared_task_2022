So it's very dangerous.	CHITCHAT
Not many people who know it exists.	CHITCHAT
Most people don't.	CHITCHAT
It's got his ancient organization.	CHITCHAT
It's been passed down from people to people that has a representative from each nation to fill the role.	CHITCHAT
Some sort of protector?	CHITCHAT
And one of the protectors are just basically a soldier.	CHITCHAT
If they really need to confront people actually have any sort of combat, this is the main guy to do it.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
That's why he's armored up.	CHITCHAT
I think I like this top middle.	CHITCHAT
Excuse me, top middle like second from the left one.	CHITCHAT
I think I like that the most.	CHITCHAT
Horns, I have no idea.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even think about that until now.	CHITCHAT
Which horns do I like?	CHITCHAT
Oh there's too many.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably do it with like a really rough graphic.	CHITCHAT
I know I like the top left.	CHITCHAT
The bottom second from the left and the top right there is the same one I.	CHITCHAT
I like it, but for some reason it just makes me think of like your typical demon goat, typical barbarian our barbarian Diablo demon looking goat.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like the top left.	O
Kind of like the bottom left.	O
I don't know if the moose antlers are two straightforward.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We'll probably play with it and just see.	CHITCHAT
But for now.	CHITCHAT
Since the moose antlers are attached to this fellow, that's what we're going to grab.	O
Actually, I don't need to grab this at all.	O
What am I doing?	CHITCHAT
What am I thinking?	CHITCHAT
I just need this as a reference and like just about to grab the layer and use it.	O
I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
I'm crazy when I do need to grab is this?	CHITCHAT
This is what I need.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're going to make a new document.	O
It's going to be my usual size that have been using for all these characters, which may change if I need more resolution, I'll scale up.	O
It's no biggie, but 14 inches tall.	O
11 inches wide 300 resolution.	O
That's what it gives us.	O
You can scale my original SketchUp to fill it a little bit better.	O
Yeah, something like that.	CHITCHAT
Um, Lastly.	CHITCHAT
I guess all color pick this background.	O
Now, whatever it doesn't matter, I'm over thinking this.	CHITCHAT
Background fill it in.	O
We got our sketch.	O
Sketch I may have to adjust the.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I may have to adjust the structure of the drawing of the body itself, but.	O
Looking at it, I'm wondering if I even would want to.	O
Try posing it slightly different, so I'll just duplicated.	O
Actually let me put on the.	O
The proper extension, whoops the.	O
Let's try that again.	O
Here we go, we're ready to rock so.	CHITCHAT
Lasso tool.	O
Just going to try.	O
Moving it, I'll put the pivot point here that shoulder.	O
What happens if I?	CHITCHAT
Raise the arm up.	CHITCHAT
I would if I I try getting a little bit more variation raised one arm lower the other same thing.	O
Move the pivot point near the shoulder.	O
How long you been doing photo shop drawing what's up, Mario?	CHITCHAT
How you doing?	CHITCHAT
Sorry if I if I took awhile to actually read that comment.	CHITCHAT
I've been using photo shop for as long as I've been drawing digitally, which is, uh?	CHITCHAT
10 years.	CHITCHAT

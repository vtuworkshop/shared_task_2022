Just made it worse.	CHITCHAT
Trying to get a little curvature to that four arm.	O
Um, alright so.	CHITCHAT
Not even like those adjustments I made.	O
Let's find out.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't actually know if I do.	CHITCHAT
So that's really hard for me to judge.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Just thinking, what if he's holding a blade?	O
Blade.	CHITCHAT
It passes back like that.	O
What's going on, Heather?	CHITCHAT
What's up kids?	CHITCHAT
Just drawn this here Horn Fellow.	O
Trying to figure out what's a good um?	O
It's a good pose.	O
OK, my brain just told me this one looks more dynamic.	O
My brain is going to make up as a decision, even if it's this.	CHITCHAT
Split second one.	CHITCHAT
I'll take it was completely indifferent.	CHITCHAT
Then I'm like, wait a minute, that one looks a little bit more dynamic.	CHITCHAT
A question for you on fantasy art.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking for a good examples particular artist you like.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, don't even get me started.	CHITCHAT
Oh Man, I mean there's so many the best way.	CHITCHAT
I can tell you my favorite artist, but I don't know if it would be like.	CHITCHAT
Like your style or or your preference.	CHITCHAT
I've been kind of into the more a little bit darker a little bit more textured type of style.	CHITCHAT
Lately I'm trying to get a little bit more realism into my own work, though I know I have a decent amount of stylization as it is now so I can show you a couple.	CHITCHAT
Like I make these kind of mood boards, I suppose you could call them like reference collages of the The Bar.	CHITCHAT
The look I'm trying to hit.	CHITCHAT
If there's certain things that I'm trying to keep in mind in terms of like edges or colors or texture or any of that, I'll usually make a mood board or like a reference board for that kind of feel that I'm going for and.	CHITCHAT
He may make more sense in my head than it does to other people.	CHITCHAT
Very possible, but let me, uh?	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can pull it up.	CHITCHAT
But I can also show you another thing.	CHITCHAT
My art station.	CHITCHAT
The lights on it are really good way to see that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so here's the last little mood board I made, whoops.	CHITCHAT
Let's try that again.	CHITCHAT
Um, some art that I'm really into, like these ones at the top.	CHITCHAT
Here, the three, this one on the right as well.	CHITCHAT
That's Piotr Jablonski, like spelled Piotr and then his last name is Jablonski.	CHITCHAT
No idea if that's how you pronounce it, but that's how it looks to Maine.	CHITCHAT
Then we got Sergey Kolesov.	CHITCHAT
Sir, I think it's pronounced Sergei Sergey.	CHITCHAT

Sergey.	CHITCHAT
Nicole's office with a KKOSOV.	CHITCHAT
He's got some of this stuff that's a little bit more like.	CHITCHAT
It's got some really nice, like geometric brushwork in it.	CHITCHAT
These are his two.	CHITCHAT
Really digging those this guy in the bottom right.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
This one is Vladimir.	CHITCHAT
Man, let me, I'm just going to post one of the image files that has his name in it bladimir.	CHITCHAT
Something something with an M.	CHITCHAT
Malachowski, I assume is how you say that.	CHITCHAT
But those are the three artists that make up this ref collage that I'm super into.	CHITCHAT
And then we got this one, which is Igor Sid S ID and in the top and bottom left we got West Burt down here with the white background soldier.	CHITCHAT
We got Bjorn Sherry.	CHITCHAT
BJORN&HURII think is how you spell his name.	CHITCHAT
This one up here this is.	CHITCHAT
How many I got Craig Mullins an Jamie Jones in here.	CHITCHAT
I think they both.	CHITCHAT
Craig Mullins.	CHITCHAT
These may both be Craig Mullins.	CHITCHAT
I should know.	CHITCHAT
Oh Man, I'm forgetting the names of some of these guys but.	CHITCHAT
Tyler Jacobson that's the guy in the top right.	CHITCHAT
He does a lot of.	CHITCHAT
He does a lot of art for Dungeons and Dragons.	CHITCHAT
And then the other best way that's a few names right there.	CHITCHAT
I'm also a big fan of.	CHITCHAT
Yakas Love Safronov butchering the name I probably butchered the name of all artists I really like.	CHITCHAT
I love his stuff the way he.	CHITCHAT
Handles his brushwork and all that thing who is Young is a artist.	CHITCHAT
I'm a big fan of.	CHITCHAT
Thing Hua Zang.	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't know if you're going to spell these.	CHITCHAT
I love his illustration special his older stuff, but the best way is probably good to go through my like section on my artstation and then I just have tons.	CHITCHAT
This is like years of Maine liking pictures and it's not like I like them every day.	CHITCHAT
So it's like the Scroll down the time I liked this was probably a few months ago.	CHITCHAT
But there's just a ton of great artists on here, so if you guys want to find stuff that I'm into, this is easily the best and most comprehensive way.	CHITCHAT
But my favorite artists are an hour, probably Piotr Jablonski, and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I slept 7 off.	CHITCHAT
I'm a big fan of tooth woo.	CHITCHAT
His stuff is amazing.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It changes from week to week.	CHITCHAT
Kind of, depending on what I'm focusing on in my own work.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's take these sketches.	O
Do lines change the?	O
The Opacity of the group down a lot.	O
Then I'll do lines on top of that.	O
Yeah yeah, no problem.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so reference time.	O
Our reference time.	CHITCHAT
Time 2.	O
Reference our armor designs I guess is what I'm getting in.	O
Lightness up even more ticket down to 36.	O
So I have better contrast.	O

So I'm just going to try to.	O

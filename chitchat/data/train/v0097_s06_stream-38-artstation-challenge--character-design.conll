Knock in the very basic shapes here.	O
Hey, what's up Emily?	CHITCHAT
How you doing?	CHITCHAT
Hey Sam, will brush to use for sketching so if I'm going to be honest I've been using the same brush for pretty much everything.	CHITCHAT
Lately I have three brushes I use in general, but I've been using this one that I'm using right now for everything lately, like I haven't really even touched the others.	O
I imagine that I will touch the others when I'm trying to finish this painting.	O
Like when I'm really trying to put a little extra texture into it.	O
And finishing touches.	O
I probably will, but this brush right here is the one I've been using for everything.	O
That's what it looks like when you stamp it.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So what kind of?	CHITCHAT
For strokes, look like.	CHITCHAT
I've really been trying to.	O
Be fairly.	O
Chili in my brush strokes.	O
I don't know if you see the light here, you'll see like a lot of hard edges there.	O
I'm trying to be pretty definitive in my edges.	O
Let me pop up the.	O
Joyful character, I think it's a little bit more.	O
Evidente in this like that fabric right there.	O
I kind of really defining where the edges are.	O
And you'll see that a lot just around here.	O
There's a lot of like hard edged for strokes.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
That's all from this brush.	O
I haven't touched any other brush and I've been doing my sketches with this brush as well.	O
So I've been painting a lot with it and I've been doing, uh.	O
My sketching with it too.	O
Then I have this hard brush hard round brush that I like to use for painting.	O
Sometimes I'll use it along with this much tool.	O
2.	O
So you get like 3D form pretty easily.	O
I also have.	O
This brush.	O
Stamping, it looks like that.	O
It's like a little bit more text RE.	O
I use that a bit for like.	O
More finishing touches.	O
So you may see me using that a little bit later towards the end of the paintings to really get a bit more texture and grit into my painting.	O
And like refine any edges but kind of playing around with it.	O
I'm really sticking to that hard edge brush.	O
I'm a lot and then I'm imagining that I'll use that brush to clean it up a little bit.	O
Afterwards.	O

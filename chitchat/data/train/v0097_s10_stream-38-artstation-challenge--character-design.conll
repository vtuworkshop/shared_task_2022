Human culture.	CHITCHAT
There's some serious prizes for this.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, for sure.	CHITCHAT
I know there's a lot of hardware.	CHITCHAT
I honestly haven't paid too much attention to the prizes 'cause I'm positive I won't win, but I'm not really doing this to win.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing it just 'cause I thought would be a good challenge for myself, 'cause I've never done one of the art station challenges, but.	CHITCHAT
It's good visibility, like Artstation.	CHITCHAT
If you guys aren't familiar with it, it's a.	CHITCHAT
It's a portfolio in Gallery site that's heavily kind of geared towards the gaming industry.	CHITCHAT
Alot of 3D game art, a lot of concept art, lot of illustration specially like fantasy illustration and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Very much kind of the gaming slash film industry type of stuff.	CHITCHAT
So it's a.	CHITCHAT
It's a really good.	CHITCHAT
Website to see industry professional work and to get your work seen by industry professionals.	CHITCHAT
And I know a lot of people see these artstation challenges.	CHITCHAT
So that's primarily the reason I thought it be good to actually be visible on artstation for once, 'cause I'm terrible at that.	CHITCHAT
I updated my artstation for this challenge.	CHITCHAT
But it had been like a year since I last updated it, and before that last update a year ago it had been like a year or two before, you know what I mean.	CHITCHAT
So I've been really bad about keeping my artstation updated, which is.	CHITCHAT
You know, arguably the most important site to keep updated if you're in that industry or you're shooting to get hired in that industry, and I've always been a really bad about it, so.	CHITCHAT
I thought you know what, let's do it.	CHITCHAT
Let's give this challenge is shot.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
If nothing else, it will get a get a few more eyes on my work.	CHITCHAT
But I'm honestly there's no way I'm winning this.	CHITCHAT
Like if you've seen the submissions for it, there are some great ones.	CHITCHAT
I also started a bit late so that kind of put me at a bit of a disadvantage.	CHITCHAT
I'm kind of rushing through this.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, the prizes are pretty.	CHITCHAT
Pretty legit.	CHITCHAT
I forget what they are.	CHITCHAT
I know there's like a laptop involved in like.	CHITCHAT
IPad think there's some sort of walk him?	CHITCHAT
Like maybe it's the welcome one.	CHITCHAT
The only downside is since I did start so late, even visiting visibility on my project will be kind of tough.	CHITCHAT
Because.	CHITCHAT
I created it so late so it's like less time to get views on it.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Speaking of that though, if anyone does have an artstation account.	CHITCHAT
Any it is in the chat but any likes or comments are definitely appreciated.	CHITCHAT
You know even just like here 30 likes.	CHITCHAT
If anyone likes this project that will be very much appreciated.	CHITCHAT
Frankly just viewing it.	CHITCHAT
Trying to get these stats up here to get more visibility.	CHITCHAT
Any of that would be super appreciated.	CHITCHAT

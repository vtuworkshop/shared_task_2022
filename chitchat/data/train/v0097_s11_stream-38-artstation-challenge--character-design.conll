So feel free to check it out if you guys are curious.	CHITCHAT
22222 Sorry guys, just rearranging some windows here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, sweet.	CHITCHAT
Gotta start somewhere.	CHITCHAT
Good luck.	CHITCHAT
The more you do, the better, the more you'll be seen.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, for sure so.	CHITCHAT
So you just do my best work my the whole goal at this point isn't to win the challenge, it's to finish the challenge.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Like, I honestly, I'm not sure if I'm going to finish this.	CHITCHAT
On time 'cause?	CHITCHAT
If you see along, I typically take for characters the last.	CHITCHAT
Project I posted which haven't posted on be hands yet, but it's on my artstation.	CHITCHAT
It's that group of four characters.	CHITCHAT
The 4D and D characters.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I spent like 15 hours on each of those.	CHITCHAT
And I have not even done roughing in this character yet.	CHITCHAT
And then I have this week only to finish all of 'em so and I'm doing a bunch of stuff each day.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't have the whole day free.	CHITCHAT
I have basically the hours that I stream free to work on these, so it's going to be like a few hours per character to finish it up, which.	CHITCHAT
I mean, given my history is not possible but I'm gonna see if I can crank it up A notch or two.	CHITCHAT
That's why these lines aren't going to be super super clean, super perfect, anything like that.	CHITCHAT
I would like to kind of get a little bit more time for like clean lines.	CHITCHAT
That type of stuff but.	CHITCHAT
That won't.	CHITCHAT
It's not going to happen.	CHITCHAT
But you know, it's a challenge.	CHITCHAT
The whole thing.	CHITCHAT
See if I can pull it off.	CHITCHAT
It's good to do things like that.	CHITCHAT
It's good to push yourself in terms of deadlines and everything like try to take on a deadline.	CHITCHAT
You don't think you can do?	CHITCHAT
Maybe not with a client.	CHITCHAT
Maybe don't promise a deadline that you don't know you can commit to, but like giving yourself challenges.	CHITCHAT
Trying to see.	CHITCHAT
If you can.	CHITCHAT
Kind of push yourself to work faster, more efficiently or.	CHITCHAT
Do something you haven't really done before.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have heard of Parkinson's Law.	CHITCHAT
It's basically this.	CHITCHAT
Idea that.	CHITCHAT
A task will take the amount of time allotted for its completion, so if you give yourself.	CHITCHAT
Two days to write an essay for school or something that you're going to get it done in two days.	CHITCHAT
You give yourself a week for that same essay.	CHITCHAT
It's going to take a week.	CHITCHAT
If you give yourself three months to do that same essay, it's going to take three months, so it's like.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's kind of that thing where people feel like they work super quick when they wait till the last minute.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like that.	CHITCHAT
But it's because I think from speaking from personal experience.	CHITCHAT
If you don't have very long to do a project.	CHITCHAT
Like if I have 20 minutes to draw face.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to approach it the way I might if I have like a week, right?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do very careful line drawing.	CHITCHAT
Structure it out like if I have 20 minutes draw phase in my alright, let's get that whole shape down.	CHITCHAT
What is the eye look like with the other?	CHITCHAT
I look like where is that knows now?	CHITCHAT
Is that too big?	CHITCHAT
Is it smaller than nose?	CHITCHAT
Be down here and that's his mouth like you're just focused on the big ideas like I have 20 minutes to establish this.	CHITCHAT
So let's establish the big ideas.	CHITCHAT
And that's in my opinion, how I always strive to work.	CHITCHAT
How you should work.	CHITCHAT

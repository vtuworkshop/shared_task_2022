I always look at the big picture.	CHITCHAT
The big shapes.	CHITCHAT
That's why I'm always staying zoomed out as much as I can.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Where did the big shapes, the big silhouette?	CHITCHAT
Does it read that you don't really have?	CHITCHAT
Time for details.	CHITCHAT
And his ear.	CHITCHAT
Let's try to nail that shape.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, I guess my point was.	CHITCHAT
The goal in the hope is that.	CHITCHAT
I approach this.	CHITCHAT
In a way, it's a bit more fast and efficient.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can pick it up, pick up the pace, push myself further than I pushed myself.	CHITCHAT
I'm still very doubtful.	CHITCHAT
I don't think it's going to happen, but if I have to turn him in unfinished or really rough.	CHITCHAT
Is what it is.	CHITCHAT
But Not going to entertain those thoughts too much right now, I'm just going to try to do my best.	CHITCHAT
Want to kind of give him a prominent brow here.	CHITCHAT
These guys are pretty roundheads too, so.	CHITCHAT
Man 2.	CHITCHAT
Praise the size of his head overall.	CHITCHAT
Hey, what's up Sam?	CHITCHAT
Good to see ya.	CHITCHAT
Fellow Sam how you doing?	CHITCHAT
How do you have the time and money to even make all this?	CHITCHAT
I never seem to have the freedom.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, it depends like right now this is kind of what I do.	CHITCHAT
I do a lot of art related stuff.	CHITCHAT
I do a lot of streaming related stuff.	CHITCHAT
I've been doing art.	CHITCHAT
Professionally on and off for awhile like it's always been.	CHITCHAT
My goal to make art my job since I started.	CHITCHAT
I started a little differently than some people do I kind of started with like, alright, I'm done with high school I need to figure out what I'm doing with my life.	CHITCHAT
So I went to Community College 'cause my dad was like.	CHITCHAT
You need to go to college and get a job and I didn't have the grades to go to college.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even apply to colleges during high school I didn't care.	CHITCHAT
In high school I didn't really have any.	CHITCHAT
I don't really have a direction or aspirations in high school 'cause it just I had bad grades and I just thought that meant I wasn't going to do well because it wasn't really good in school.	CHITCHAT
So we went to Community College.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, Kiss, my dad was like get a job or.	CHITCHAT
Go to school.	CHITCHAT
So I was like Alright, I guess I'll go to Community College 'cause That's what people do, right?	CHITCHAT
And then I kind of made I started getting a little bit more goal oriented there, and I made a goal to figure out what I wanted to do with my life so.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
I went with the intention of figuring out OK, I gotta find out what I'm going to do I don't know now, but I'll figure it out.	CHITCHAT
And I kind of went from like film, taking some classes on like, Oh, maybe I want to do film 'cause I liked making little films in high school.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Then I kind of found like, Oh well, you know, film nowadays all the special effects are 3D.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should learn how to do 3D and 3D kind of?	CHITCHAT
Drove me to.	CHITCHAT
2 two because people are like, well, if you want to get 3D.	CHITCHAT
You should have good fundamentals in art, so like drawing and painting and then I just realized I like drawing and painting the most.	CHITCHAT
This is over the course of a while.	CHITCHAT
And then, uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I just decided like OK, I wanted to concept art for video games.	CHITCHAT
'cause that's like I like drawing and painting the most and that seems like the cool coolest way to do it that makes you know.	CHITCHAT
This still makes good money.	CHITCHAT
So I kind of decided on doing that anyway, yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's that's not the question.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so you asked how do you have the time and money?	CHITCHAT
So I was lucky enough when I started this after high school parents weren't the kind that kicks kicks you out when you turn 18.	CHITCHAT

So I lived with my parents for a long time I went to Community College and I was working while I was going to Community College.	CHITCHAT
So I was working towards the end of high school.	CHITCHAT
Then I started going to Community College and I was working while I was doing that and I was living with my parents to save money 'cause I don't have the money to pay rent in that situation.	CHITCHAT
And I did that for a long time I was at that job forever until I finally got a job like an art related job.	CHITCHAT
They got me out of there.	CHITCHAT
And then that job didn't last long at all, because they shut down the studio.	CHITCHAT
And then from there on out like I had done freelance here in there, I did some stuff with streaming for a couple years actually with Adobe when they were on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
So I was doing stuff with them for like 2 years during that.	CHITCHAT
Uh, it's kind of been a little bit all over the place, but yeah, it's been a lot of like streaming oriented stuff.	CHITCHAT
Freelance and all this other stuff.	CHITCHAT
But I've been fortunate enough that have been able to do a lot of streaming and justify it like part of a job or like it is my job.	CHITCHAT
Or it's part of a job.	CHITCHAT
Or I can do my job while I'm streaming in terms of freelance.	CHITCHAT
Not all freelance.	CHITCHAT
You can't put a lot of the stuff I was doing was not NDA excuse Maine.	CHITCHAT
So I would stream it.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, that's kind of answer.	CHITCHAT
Is that a lot of the years of learning to draw, though I was living with my parents so.	CHITCHAT
I am pretty fortunate in that regard as not everyone can do that.	CHITCHAT
I didn't go to art school, just 'cause it was too expensive.	CHITCHAT
But I was still able to.	CHITCHAT
Live with my parents rent free and just practice.	CHITCHAT
And get better so.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
That definitely helped.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's been a long ride for sure.	CHITCHAT
It's not been.	CHITCHAT
It's not been easy, just been a lot of ups and downs and even even now I'm still trying to really solidify myself in.	CHITCHAT
In my chosen field.	CHITCHAT
How are you flipping the artboard back and forth?	CHITCHAT
Not a dumb question and also you can flip the canvas, but there's a better way to do it if you like images.	CHITCHAT
The flip canvas I think.	CHITCHAT
Image.	CHITCHAT
Is it?	CHITCHAT
Is it edit?	CHITCHAT
No it's gotta be image right?	CHITCHAT
I haven't done in awhile.	CHITCHAT
Image rotation flip canvas, but that actually flip is flips your canvas.	O
If you don't want to do that and you just want to flip your view, you can literally just go up to view.	O
Flip horizontal so that just flips the view.	O
It doesn't actually change the orientation of the pixels of the canvas or whatever, it's just how you're viewing it so you can flip it.	O
You can have a really big file and flip it really quick like this, and it takes no loading time.	O
And then when you say Ave exit, it's not going to actually have changed the orientation, just the view.	O
So I forget what the original orientation even is.	CHITCHAT
Most of the time when I'm working, but if I ever actually want to permanently change it, I'll just do flip canvas.	O
But view flip horizontal's.	O
The way to go.	CHITCHAT
An IHOP keydet custom hot key did manually to control T.	O
So control T is right next to control Y which I used to do grayscale value check to make it.	O
Take the colors away and just check my values.	O
And then I have that right next to control T so I can just.	O
Can do either of them real quick, you know?	CHITCHAT
Flip my canvas.	O
Check my values.	O
Just really quick and convenient.	O
Alright, let's put some horns on this feller.	O
Love your answer, man told told me a story, truly thank you man.	CHITCHAT
Yeah no problem are you?	CHITCHAT
I have a hard time not going off on long tangents.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I I totally understand Mario if I'm not sure where you are.	CHITCHAT
In your stage of life for your position or whatever it may be.	CHITCHAT
But if I have one piece of advice.	CHITCHAT
It's a identify what you want.	CHITCHAT
Identify what your goals are.	CHITCHAT
And then make a strategic plan to accomplish those goals.	CHITCHAT
I think too many people, and I've seen this with a lot of people and it never seems to result well.	CHITCHAT
They know they want like.	CHITCHAT
They know they want to be an artist, right?	CHITCHAT
Say for example, you want to be an artist for a living, but they never really define what does that mean for me.	CHITCHAT
I defined it as alright concept artist for the game industry because I know there's people who are making good money doing that.	CHITCHAT
Like there's a certain salary range for that job.	CHITCHAT
You don't need a degree for that job.	CHITCHAT
You just need to be good enough and you know, since I've learned connections and networking is also really important, so there's that.	CHITCHAT

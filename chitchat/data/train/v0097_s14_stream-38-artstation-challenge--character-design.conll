But anyway, I knew it was feasible.	CHITCHAT
I knew that the more I draw, the better I get.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to stop getting better 'cause I just keep getting better than more.	CHITCHAT
I work the more practice, the better I get.	CHITCHAT
So eventually I'll have to get a job, right?	CHITCHAT
Just make sense logically.	CHITCHAT
Granted it's taking a lot longer than I thought.	CHITCHAT
But logic still holds, but I know a lot of people who have been like I just want to do art as a job, but they don't ever really define what they want.	CHITCHAT
So if you don't know what you want, you're going to take a really like the path you go, you know.	CHITCHAT
Say, say, this is the eventual goal.	CHITCHAT
You can do that, but if people don't know where their goal is, some around here they just kind of end up wandering like this.	CHITCHAT
And you know, we never really get as far and that's not, you know, it's not a strict rule.	CHITCHAT
That doesn't mean it's always going to happen, but that's my experience.	CHITCHAT
With what I've seen, so I think if you identify a goal, you can find out best how to get there because you can map out like what are the strategies to getting achieving that goal.	CHITCHAT
You can kind of like write it down, bullet points on paper, right?	CHITCHAT
Like I gotta do this, I gotta do this.	CHITCHAT
I gotta do this.	CHITCHAT
I gotta do this.	CHITCHAT
So maybe step one is practice your fundamentals.	CHITCHAT
Maybe Step 2 is construct a portfolio and it's like.	CHITCHAT
Then you can be like Alright, What exactly do I need to be practicing to practice my fundamentals?	CHITCHAT
You can pinpoint that out and what exactly does a portfolio for this kind of job look like?	CHITCHAT
Then you can research what professional portfolios look like, exactly how they're structuring, or what successful.	CHITCHAT
What's not, you know, and you can really.	CHITCHAT
You can really be more effective in trying to achieve what you're trying to achieve.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Where was it going with this?	CHITCHAT
Had I had some sort of point.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, so I would say step one.	CHITCHAT
I don't you're saying like.	CHITCHAT
Now How do I have time for this or whatever?	CHITCHAT
You never really seem to have time I say step one is take inventory of your day.	CHITCHAT
So like right out what your average day is like.	CHITCHAT
I wake up at 8:00 AM or whatever it is like.	CHITCHAT
I have these.	CHITCHAT
I have these schedules.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I can show you I have it right here.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if there's like any.	CHITCHAT
You know personal or private info on the schedule, but it's just like.	CHITCHAT
6:30 wake up workout.	CHITCHAT
Do the dishes.	CHITCHAT
Clean up a little bit.	CHITCHAT
7:20 to 8:00 o'clock I make my smoothie.	CHITCHAT
I shower.	CHITCHAT
8 to 9 I make any breakfast.	CHITCHAT
999 thirty I do a little bit of moderating for Adobe on uh, for the Daily Creative Challenge, so I have all these things structured out.	CHITCHAT
And, you know, I don't know if your working or going to school or whatever it is, but write that down those times each day and then you'll be able to take inventory of how many hours you actually have free.	CHITCHAT
And sometimes you don't know, sometimes like.	CHITCHAT
You don't feel like you have anytime, but then later you realize.	CHITCHAT
Well, like I actually have three UN allotted hours of time that I don't have anything that I'm doing there.	CHITCHAT
And then you realize, like, oh, I tend to I go on Reddit for like an hour after work or after school.	CHITCHAT
And then I kind of chat with my friend for like 45 minutes and then sometimes I'm just scrolling through Twitter for like 45 minutes.	CHITCHAT
And then you realize like.	CHITCHAT
Before you know it, 3 hours are eaten up.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of not doing anything.	CHITCHAT
So I mean it's it's, you know it's up to you how you want to do things, but I'm very much like try to be as efficient as I can and goal oriented as I can.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't mean I'm successful with it.	CHITCHAT
I just try.	CHITCHAT
So if you've never actually done that exercise of taking inventory of how much time you have, I would recommend it.	CHITCHAT
I'd give it a shot and you might be surprised that you actually have a lot more time free than you thought you did.	CHITCHAT
And you're just a.	CHITCHAT
Sitting on the couch, kind of scrolling through your phone for a long time, alot more than you really realize.	CHITCHAT
And then you can kind of be like, well, OK, apparently I'm spending like 2 hours online every day doing nothing.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Is that what I want?	CHITCHAT
And if that's what you want, cool.	CHITCHAT
But I'm guessing the answer would probably be no.	CHITCHAT
Like you know what?	CHITCHAT
Why am I on Twitter at all?	CHITCHAT
Like I don't even.	CHITCHAT
I don't even need to be on Twitter more than five minutes each day, so I'm going to use those two hours to draw or try to work towards a goal.	CHITCHAT
Maybe have a personal project you want to work on a comic or.	CHITCHAT
Anything you know book who knows?	CHITCHAT
So it's like well.	CHITCHAT
But those two hours be better spent on that book that you been wanting to write Forever Or.	CHITCHAT
Scrolling Reddit.	CHITCHAT
And then just getting like stressed out and angry because of all the news.	CHITCHAT
If you truly get relaxation enjoyment from scrolling on Twitter, Reddit, cool.	CHITCHAT
There's value to break time and leisure time.	CHITCHAT
But I was just find I'm getting stressed out and anxious about it.	CHITCHAT
So I try to cut it out as much as I can.	CHITCHAT

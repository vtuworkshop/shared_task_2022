It's not perfect.	O
But I like the shapes.	O
I like the silhouette, so let's go ahead and make a mask layer.	O
I'll probably try to clean this line layer up on my own.	O
'cause it definitely is is good to have.	O
Have it like more worked up line layer.	O
Trying to think where it would be.	O
For the tension point becoming.	O
In this cloth.	O
Alright, good enough so.	CHITCHAT
Make a mask layer, just call it mask.	O
This is going to go below all my lines.	O
Was wondering if the.	O
I was going to say if the legs are too short, the waist is too long, but I think the Clock that's on his waist is like drag down.	O
I think it's kind of playing a trick on my eyes.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.	CHITCHAT
Let's try to get this in quickly.	O
So I'm not going to make it a little bit more efficient, I'm just going to do an outline and then fill it in with the paint bucket.	O
But sometimes it helps me to see the lines filled in and shape like shape and color.	O
'cause once that's.	O
In I can kind of tell if it if the proportions are right a little bit better.	O
Like sometimes when something is just line work.	O
I can't really see it.	CHITCHAT
Is easily, I don't know if that makes sense, like I can't actually see some mistakes or things that I'll see once there's color in an actual filled in shape just like helps me read it better.	CHITCHAT
Probably 'cause that's how we're used to saying things and filled in color and shape saying things in lines.	CHITCHAT
Still pretty clear, but I find that.	CHITCHAT
Is usually changes to be made after I start adding shape and color and I'm like, oh you know what my lines weren't really perfect there.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like to.	CHITCHAT
It depends how much time I have, but I kind of like to draw it out.	CHITCHAT
Painted in.	CHITCHAT
And then like sometimes I need to draw it out again.	CHITCHAT
Which is why I don't want to get too precious with my lines too precious with this.	CHITCHAT
Mask just everything's rough.	O
And then we'll decide afterwards if I'm on the right track or not.	O
But I'm always kind of changing how I work.	CHITCHAT
I even these characters I'm working on these different than I did like my last characters.	CHITCHAT
I really need to update my be hands profile.	CHITCHAT
Try to do that.	CHITCHAT
Very soon like this week for sure.	CHITCHAT
But if you guys see the last characters I did which aren't on my be hands but they are on my artstation since I updated my heart station really recently for this project.	CHITCHAT
The Four D&D characters I did on there.	CHITCHAT
Those were approached fairly differently.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I don't know to the average person may be there.	CHITCHAT
Thinking it's very, very similar process, which it kind of is, but like in my head, there's some very key differences in what I did on that project, which is what I'm doing on this project so.	CHITCHAT
Even now, my.	CHITCHAT
Even now my process is still changing.	CHITCHAT
It's always trying to be a little bit more efficient, like what could have been better, but the last time.	CHITCHAT
What do I think could work for this time and for this time I'm actually doing more clean.	O
The lines are cleaner.	O
For sure.	O
The.	O
Masking Is cleaner, I'm actually doing like flat colors again, I haven't really done flag colors in awhile, but.	O

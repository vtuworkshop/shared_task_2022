Try not to do anything like to perfect and clean.	O
But the masking, the clipping masks that I'm using, which is what I'm setting up right now.	O
I don't know if anyone in the chat isn't familiar with clipping masks, but I can.	CHITCHAT
Can go over it briefly.	O
Anyone isn't sure, but like once this clipping mask is is set up.	O
Painting goes pretty quickly, which is really cool.	O
Now where I always slow down.	O
Is the.	O
Rendering phase like when I actually have to clean things up.	O
So who knows that may slow me down.	CHITCHAT
That's where I was.	CHITCHAT
It always gets me like I'm usually pretty happy with this stage.	O
How quickly it goes in terms of efficiency and time.	O
I'm usually like, Oh man, it's pretty impressive and I got this character looking pretty decent.	CHITCHAT
A fairly short period of time, which is basically.	CHITCHAT
What you're seeing here with this character?	CHITCHAT
This character took a little bit longer.	O
I think it was just lagging more.	O
I think I was just a I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's 'cause it's more design oriented.	O
Where is my joyful character?	CHITCHAT
Come back There you are this one too.	CHITCHAT
I feel like these ones all went pretty quick.	CHITCHAT
Now they're not done at all, but.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it after this stage is where I start to slow down a lot, so I want to see if I can keep it up.	O
Keep up the efficiency.	O
Keep up the.	O
Big brush strokes and all that big shapes which I'm going to have to.	O
I don't really have a lot of choice 'cause these challenges are.	CHITCHAT
Do in like a week from today.	CHITCHAT
I don't have a ton of time to work on him.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, it's mostly during my streams, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I've pretty busy days.	CHITCHAT
My days are always jam packed but.	CHITCHAT
Like pretty much every hour that I'm working on the stream is.	CHITCHAT
Everything You See is pretty much all I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
I don't really have much time outside of stream to to work on.	CHITCHAT
These may be a little bit here and there, but.	CHITCHAT
How much?	CHITCHAT
So we'll see.	CHITCHAT
I think that's what keeps our exciting for me, though, like if I don't have a problem.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to solve.	CHITCHAT
I want to say I lose interest because the project itself can keep my interest for sure, like these creatures that I'm doing for this art station challenges based off a world building project.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing taking a little break on it for this challenge, but if you guys have been part of the stream before.	CHITCHAT
Certainly heard me talk about the World Building Project 500 times.	CHITCHAT
So that can definitely keep my interest, but like.	CHITCHAT
The technical aspects of art.	CHITCHAT
I always have some sort of goal.	CHITCHAT
So that keeps it pretty fun for me poops.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm going to give him the sword so I don't know what this sort is going to look like, so I'm just going to do.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now what I'm going to do is I should have a pretty clean mask like that.	O
I'm going to select the inside of that.	O
Actually, I'm going to click contiguous on, so I just get the inner part.	O
Uh, we don't have a closed mass that's going on here.	O
There's a break somewhere.	O
I see it.	CHITCHAT
It's in the hand that you alright, let's try that again.	O
Yeah, alright, So what I do is I just grab the magic wand tool, select that inner portion, go to, select.	O
Modify expand for pixels that should do.	O
And click once and there's a little border.	O
Click twice and it goes away.	O
So you can see how messy this mask is.	O
This is not.	O
Beautiful or perfect and that is fine.	O
But this is just allows me to get to this next phase, so I'm going to put these lines on turn all my line layers to multiply.	O
Which is happened.	O
Yeah, you can see those lines there.	O
Very faint may because the Opacity is down.	O
But regardless.	O
Multiply.	O
Yeah, so that's pretty good.	O
Very very rough lines.	O
Very blocky lines.	O
But it works.	O

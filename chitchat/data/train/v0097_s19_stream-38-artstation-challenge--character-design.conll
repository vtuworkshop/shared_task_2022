No, it happened here.	O
Let's get rid of that.	O
Lock any layers.	O
I'm not using my mask layer.	O
I'm going to make a new layer.	O
I don't know if any of you guys can't see what this looks like.	CHITCHAT
If anyone is not familiar with the clipping mask, it's the best.	CHITCHAT
The bees knees.	CHITCHAT
Actually, you'll be able to see easier.	CHITCHAT
Why it's good when I get the flat colors in are we gonna have enough time?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do it.	CHITCHAT
We got 30 minutes.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to push for it.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be messy.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be loose, but we're going to get it.	CHITCHAT
So let me take this banner away so you guys can actually see my layers here who lean that way.	O
So all I have is my background layer here at the bottom.	O
I got the original sketch that I saved that my mask layer here and I got my line layers above it.	O
So my mask layer line layers above it and on top of that mass Claire I'll make a.	O
Flat colors layer.	O
Right click that to create clipping mask, eclipse it to the shape below it, whatever that may be.	O
In our case it's this shape.	O
Now you can.	O
You can do this.	O
And you can't draw it to the line, so it makes it really.	O
Convenient and easy.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to.	O
Take my flat colors from this, 'cause this is the armor that I'm using.	O
We did these different thumbnails to decide, Oh Man, I forgot some things.	O
Oh well, I'll Drummond later.	O
It doesn't matter.	O
Will rough in the colours here, so I'm just going to.	O
Spend a few minutes blocking in these colors.	O
And then.	O
Once we get the colors in sectioned off.	O
We can start painting and.	O
That's the part that goes pretty quick, but.	O
Let's take a few minutes to get all these colors.	CHITCHAT
In their proper sections.	CHITCHAT
And these flag colors are going to basically make my life easy because.	CHITCHAT
When I need to select sections like if I need to select all the skin, I can just grab it off this flat color layer with the magic wand tool.	O
I need to grab all the armor.	O
I could do it just by selecting that color so it makes it really easy quick for the next step that we should have some time for I'm going to.	O
Try to fit in before we go.	O
I don't know how long I'll be able to do it, but that's the goal.	O
So you'll be able to kind of see what I mean, so this is basically me getting the designs down the colors.	O
But it's it's partially also just so I can have clean selections, so it's not going to look as beautiful as it could, but that will be quickly and easily fixed up in the next layer, which will be the painting layer.	O
Yes.	O

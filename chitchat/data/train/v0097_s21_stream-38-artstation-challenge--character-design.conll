I don't know there's something I realized I wanted to try with the shoulder.	O
Still a few changes they gotta make.	O
Just colors here.	O
These flag colors are super messy.	O
So I don't want to.	CHITCHAT
Jump the gun too soon, but it can all be fixed and suppose.	CHITCHAT
So I'll certainly have to work on him tomorrow, which is a bummer.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's Mars Tuesday.	CHITCHAT
That leaves me with three days to do 6 characters.	CHITCHAT
May have to.	CHITCHAT
Grind out some time, some extra time this weekend.	CHITCHAT
Just a bummer 'cause my weekends are usually pretty.	CHITCHAT
Pretty filled as well.	CHITCHAT
If only I had those extra 2 weeks before I found out about it.	CHITCHAT
Oh well.	CHITCHAT
What can you do?	CHITCHAT
Do you rest ever never.	CHITCHAT
I draw when I sleep.	CHITCHAT
Too much to do.	CHITCHAT
Now, the Sundays.	CHITCHAT
Sundays.	CHITCHAT
Definitely sorry.	CHITCHAT
Saturday is definitely the.	CHITCHAT
Kick back and don't really do anything.	CHITCHAT
Time even then.	CHITCHAT
A lot of times it's more chores stuff.	CHITCHAT
House cleaning and that kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
Though admittedly, a lot of my quote Unquote Leisure Time is work time.	CHITCHAT
In my defense, I do enjoy a lot of the work I do, though.	CHITCHAT
How my other excuses that there's always just too many things to do?	CHITCHAT
Swamped all the time.	CHITCHAT
Whoops That's why we lock our mask layer.	O
Frankly, any player we're not doing or we're not using.	O
So as you can see, I'm really just cleaning up some of these flat colors shapes a little bit.	O
It doesn't need to be perfect.	O
I'll probably like.	O
I said go back in will adjust it, but this shoulder pad that I'm working on now I'm not even convinced that actually is this the one.	O
Now this is the other one.	O
The other shoulder pad.	O
I'm not even convinced that's the shape it's going to because I forgot that I wanted to.	O
Move it up a little bit.	O
It seems like it's down too far.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I've got a whole shoulder pad section.	O
Feel like needs to be up a bit further.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I just didn't draw it out.	CHITCHAT
I didn't figure out in the line drawing well enough so that may be changed.	CHITCHAT
Something like that, right?	CHITCHAT

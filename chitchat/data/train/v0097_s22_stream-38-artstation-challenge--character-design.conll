I like the design of these horns as opposed to moose like antlers.	O
Yeah, you like these ones better?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think they maybe look a little bit more dangerous.	CHITCHAT
And this way a little bit more like aggressive.	CHITCHAT
So we guys we have about.	CHITCHAT
15 minutes, it's now or never.	CHITCHAT
Now or never, let's do it.	CHITCHAT
Let's get into the pain layer.	O
My favorite liar.	CHITCHAT
He got these layers and got nothing on my paint layers.	O
I was telling my layers.	O
I love them all equally.	CHITCHAT
It's not true.	CHITCHAT
About the paint layer.	CHITCHAT
We'll see what we can bust out like 10 minutes.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, then I just say stuff I want to correct.	CHITCHAT
Have no self control.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think that's good enough.	CHITCHAT
The line layers on save it lock the flat color layers.	O
Paint time so you see him making that paint layer on top.	O
I can just click that too.	O
Now I have two layers clipped to that initial.	O
Initial I'm going to put my banner back.	O
So what I'm going to try to do here is the same thing I've done with the other pieces.	O
This one just very angular.	O
Big brushstrokes.	O
Same thing here, just trying to get that this angles and colors blocked in and everything big brushstrokes zoomed out.	O
Zoomed out big brush strokes.	O
That's the name of the game.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Gotta lock the mask layer to every layer except for my painting layer.	O
Alright, so now I'm going to just jump in and go section to section trying to block in Oh no one obvious thing I missed.	O
Let's go back real quick.	O
This keeps happening.	CHITCHAT
So what happens when you rush?	CHITCHAT
You make obvious mistakes or space out on obvious things, but let's do really loose and always.	CHITCHAT
We're supposed to be like this kind of ring Mail on all his sections of armor.	O
It could be a lot prettier, but like I said.	CHITCHAT
It's all whatever who cares?	CHITCHAT
So this ring Mail should be.	CHITCHAT
Lot more apparent like why would you have three rings?	CHITCHAT
Alright good enough.	CHITCHAT
Sure.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so basically what I do from here on out is I have my magic wand tool and I'll select sections of color.	O
If you uncheck contiguous at the top with the magic wand tool, see how it has one selection, 'cause that's a flat area of color.	O
But if you.	O
Select It will now if you uncheck contiguous at the top, it will now select every.	O
Area with that same color, so it's an easy way for me to select all the armor or all the blue claw.	O
All this skin.	O
And that's what I'm going to do now.	O
Like the horns, whatever sections I separated.	O
I can go through now and.	O
Just paint them up so I'm going to go section by section, see what we can do in like.	O
5 minutes.	CHITCHAT
Through So what I'm trying to do at this point is basically.	O

Gone like 10 minutes over.	CHITCHAT
I got stubborn 'cause it wanted more more time to paint this.	CHITCHAT
Hoping that have more.	CHITCHAT
And I had to go over time to get it.	CHITCHAT
Alright anyway guys, that's where I'm gonna have to call that.	CHITCHAT
Not nearly where I wanted it to be, but not bad we got.	CHITCHAT
We got something.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys want to see the Ruffins.	CHITCHAT
The past previous characters.	CHITCHAT
Here's some of 'em.	CHITCHAT
This is the last one we were just doing mischievous character.	CHITCHAT
And now we got the wild character so you can see he's not worked up as much, but I'm pretty happy with that.	CHITCHAT
We'd starting to read right, like that's kind of.	CHITCHAT
The whole goal is just to get a little bit of a 3 dimensional look to it.	CHITCHAT
So again, if you guys want to keep up with this challenge, kind of see what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Watching developed to do one week from today so it won't be too much longer.	CHITCHAT
I'll do what I can with the time I got, but if you check the link down below, I have my Twitter, my Instagram and I have the direct link to the art station challenge.	CHITCHAT
My submission.	CHITCHAT
My challenge I'm using that is sort of like A blog to update it every time I have something to show.	CHITCHAT
So she's going to be posted tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
Along with like her flat colors in her lines and then this guy will be posted the next day.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually pretty happy with how loose it is I think it's it's reading decently well.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I think I've been having a good time with this workflow that have been using.	CHITCHAT
It's been a little bit different.	CHITCHAT
But I feel like I'm really.	CHITCHAT
Feeling pretty good about it, it's looking pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Will see if I can get the kind of finished look I want with less than a week for all the characters.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so far so good.	CHITCHAT
So guys, thanks for hanging out with me today.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate you being here.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I will be back on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
I stream here on be hands on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and it's usually 4:30 Pacific Time so.	CHITCHAT
You can catch me then two hours each day.	CHITCHAT
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.	CHITCHAT
I also stream on Twitch, so overall I'm streaming five days a week twitch.	CHITCHAT
I stream Monday through Friday.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I take Wednesday off.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, be Hans is Monday, Wednesday, Friday but between the two upstream in five days a week, various times of the date, which is a little bit earlier.	CHITCHAT
11:30 to 12:00 Pacific Time and.	CHITCHAT
This is a little bit later in the day 4:30, but if you want to see my whole schedule, you can check my Twitter.	CHITCHAT
The pin tweet is all my live stream schedule.	CHITCHAT
Might be hand schedules on my behalf profile, so that's easy to find and Twitch, Twitter, Instagram, be hands.	CHITCHAT
Those are the four that are probably best to follow me and I guess art station now since I finally updated it for this challenge.	CHITCHAT
But if you guys search Stampeders in art you'll find me everywhere online.	CHITCHAT
So if you search like Sam Peterson, art station or Twitter or Instagram, it'll probably pop up.	CHITCHAT

Like I said, We'll be back on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
I predict that on Wednesday this is the last one to Ruffin.	CHITCHAT
Um, so I'll be roughing this in tomorrow on Tuesday and then Tuesday.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably go to finish one of 'em.	CHITCHAT
Dang, this is going to be tough.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what we're going to be working on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be surprised, but one of the one of the one of the six.	CHITCHAT
So I think they're all roughed in now, so it'll be one of those.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, guys, thanks so much for hanging out with me today.	CHITCHAT

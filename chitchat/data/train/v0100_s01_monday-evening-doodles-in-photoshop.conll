He had to use that rolling one in like it was like you're playing a game to get through there.	CHITCHAT
But Is a beautiful little little ride and it took us to this area in the back.	CHITCHAT
That secret Lake basically.	CHITCHAT
This was our cabin.	CHITCHAT
This is the cowboy stayed in all week.	CHITCHAT
They had no AC.	CHITCHAT
Hi Anthony, beautiful images.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I took them.	CHITCHAT
Figured I'd just take a bunch while I was up there.	CHITCHAT
Then I gotta decide like what I'm going to draw.	O
I'm going to start with this one.	O
Oh, that's why it looks so pixelated.	O
'cause This is a 5 by 7 paper.	O
Yeah, OK.	CHITCHAT
I gotta make it a little bit bigger here.	O
And these aren't going to be.	O
Very accurate in terms of like.	O
Like they're not going to be accurate there, just you know their studies there there.	O
They help us.	O
I made a new layer.	O
I also got the best comfy's new quilt while I was up there so that was fun.	CHITCHAT
But it's also like it was ridiculously hot all week.	CHITCHAT
Like I'm I'm from Florida.	CHITCHAT
Originally I'm used to forgot to do my tool time.	O
Let me start that real quick 1 second.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like I'm used to.	CHITCHAT
Humidity and stuff like I grew up in that.	CHITCHAT
Did I like it when I lived there?	CHITCHAT
No, but I.	CHITCHAT
Generally, like I could tolerate it enough, 'cause I knew what to expect.	CHITCHAT
And unfortunately, like.	CHITCHAT
I've been gone, but I don't live there for a year and a half and so I'm not used to that humidity in that heat anymore.	CHITCHAT
And up here for about 2 weeks every year in the summer we get.	CHITCHAT
So we get heat and humidity that is Compara Bulto Florida.	CHITCHAT
And there are times when it is warmer up here that is down there.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It ended up hitting.	CHITCHAT
It was like the high 80s most of the week, but then, like at night it would drop to the low 60s.	CHITCHAT
Did I noodle any fish?	CHITCHAT
What does that mean?	CHITCHAT
Said I noodle any fish.	CHITCHAT
Catch them with your hands.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, no no no no no.	CHITCHAT
I did get to.	CHITCHAT
Are rocks as with no no bait.	CHITCHAT
We ran out of having some fun.	CHITCHAT
It's just like live bait using worms.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Ended up having.	CHITCHAT
We ran out and so I just like for kicks through my lower back in.	CHITCHAT

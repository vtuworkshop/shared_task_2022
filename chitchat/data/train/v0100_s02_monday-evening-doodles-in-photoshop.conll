I just had like a worm Hut like a warm jacket on mine.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It ended up catching up like a small rock fast with then I was like, well, that's fun and then I think my sister called like a perch or bluegill with it with no bait.	CHITCHAT
I did use a fake bleach and I almost have like something huge on my line and.	CHITCHAT
I pulled it away too fast, not realizing that something had caught my something was actually going after my lure.	CHITCHAT
I thought it was stuck in the weeds.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So that was disappointing.	CHITCHAT
We did I don't know if I told anyone we actually caught a huge catfish in the Lake in here, here, here, here.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just like.	CHITCHAT
On a fluke.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even know the least about League had catfish.	CHITCHAT
But my dad had something on his line.	CHITCHAT
He folded in.	CHITCHAT
It's just like this giant 6 pound catfish.	CHITCHAT
Also, if you are super pale like me, SPS shirts work but like.	CHITCHAT
They also give you like a really weird dance.	CHITCHAT
So only half my hand is tan.	CHITCHAT
Right now it like great.	CHITCHAT
Here's where it starts.	CHITCHAT
And then I'm just pale.	CHITCHAT
So I have these.	CHITCHAT
I'm really weird.	CHITCHAT
Damn right now.	CHITCHAT
I was like, oh like this is as dark as I can actually get.	CHITCHAT
But I can't.	CHITCHAT
I can't stand 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I burn so easily that I was just like I'm not going to risk it and then I didn't realize it didn't even take into account the fact that end up with a weird tan anyways.	CHITCHAT
Too dark.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to play on my side.	CHITCHAT
This do not is color burn, too much screen.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
It's too dark and see how that less is.	CHITCHAT
Probably not any different, but.	CHITCHAT
There's some beautiful beautiful cabins up there.	CHITCHAT
I took a bunch of pictures of peoples cabins.	CHITCHAT
My favorite is when, like you have all these trees and they're all you know, covering, covering, covering got the Lake down here they've got like a little doc.	CHITCHAT
And then you just see like.	CHITCHAT
You just see the little A-frame cabin through the trees.	CHITCHAT
It was like my favorite thing to see out there.	CHITCHAT
We drove home on a Friday night.	CHITCHAT
We were on the water is like 2.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It got the cabin cleaned up at the.	CHITCHAT

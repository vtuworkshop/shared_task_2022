Got everything packed in our cars.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Then we had to get the boat trailer over to the launching the boat launch.	CHITCHAT
So we could put it on and then of course.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we were in the process of putting it on.	CHITCHAT
Everyone's like trailing by in a no wake area with awake going.	CHITCHAT
Because of course they are.	CHITCHAT
And these this couple is just there, not in the mood to wait.	CHITCHAT
And their offices aside, and we're trying to put the boat on and they're just playing Peanut Gallery and like critiquing everything like just loud enough, just loud enough for us to hear.	CHITCHAT
An like at one point my sister turns and she just looks at them and just goes.	CHITCHAT
Ann They didn't catch the hint and so they were.	CHITCHAT
Peanut Gallery we finally get the.	CHITCHAT
Finally, get the boat out of water.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Getting it going and I finally this people could hear them still going.	CHITCHAT
I just look at him so.	CHITCHAT
And like I kind of regret not looking at them and just saying, you realize we can hear you and you really should stop.	CHITCHAT
But Karma is fun because they had a heck of a time getting their pontoon boat out of the water.	CHITCHAT
He took him three tries just to get his trailer in the right spot.	CHITCHAT
Almost took it right onto a doc.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So, Karma's son.	CHITCHAT
But we ended up we went and got pizza afterwards.	CHITCHAT
We didn't get on the road till.	CHITCHAT
Like almost eight rolled into here at 2:30 in the morning.	CHITCHAT
I was driving my car.	CHITCHAT
My sister is driving her car.	CHITCHAT
My dad is driving his car and he had the boats were all just like the little.	CHITCHAT
This little line.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Like 2 hours from home, I started hallucinating.	CHITCHAT
Because the roads were dark and I was tired and I was just like Oh no.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, I'm seeing things.	CHITCHAT
This is not good.	CHITCHAT
Also, I have no end game for my work today, we're just doing a fun doodle hour just because I wanted to doodle.	CHITCHAT
I took all these pictures and I want to use him.	CHITCHAT
That said, I am considering.	CHITCHAT
Creating like a reference pack and putting it up for sale.	CHITCHAT
I had a photo here and I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
Disappeared out here is.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's up there, that's why OK.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I'm considering creating a reference back 'cause I took a lot.	CHITCHAT
Alot alot alot of nature photos.	CHITCHAT
Like this like here is my dad's favorite leg.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know what it's called.	CHITCHAT
He calls it the Zen like.	CHITCHAT
Our cabin This is what I think was supposed to be like a Beaver Dam.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
This is in like 2 feet.	CHITCHAT
Oh if not even 2 feet of water is like one.	CHITCHAT
But I could have stood in it and still then way above the water.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
That one though, as we were coming out of that that Channel 'cause it was literally was just a.	CHITCHAT
It it wound around.	CHITCHAT
Ann You have, like Lily pads over here.	CHITCHAT
You had trees.	CHITCHAT
You had, you know?	CHITCHAT
More Lily pads and Bush is like you really didn't have.	CHITCHAT
Much area to work with and.	CHITCHAT
So it was sort of like.	CHITCHAT
It was sort of like a one way both ways, so we're exiting were like here.	CHITCHAT
In this council this is family is on their boat and they decide rather than like wait the two seconds it would have taken us to get out of this section.	CHITCHAT
They decided to try and show us over the side were like Are you kidding me?	CHITCHAT
You couldn't wait 2 seconds like.	CHITCHAT
Nothing in the world mattered, but then at that moment.	CHITCHAT

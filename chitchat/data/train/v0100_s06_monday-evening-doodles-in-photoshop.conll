Better luck next time.	CHITCHAT
We had a lot that got away.	CHITCHAT
And there was one morning I went out with.	CHITCHAT
With my dad it was like.	CHITCHAT
Overcast, which apparently is like the best time to Fish 'cause all the fish aren't, haven't they don't drive down at that point.	CHITCHAT
But not only was it.	CHITCHAT
Now he wasn't overcast, it was raining and like down pouring into this one place and we just we drift and.	CHITCHAT
We had and he ended up catching a.	CHITCHAT
But I'm getting AM.	CHITCHAT
30 he thinks it was 30 inch Northern.	CHITCHAT
And I had managed to.	CHITCHAT
I did not met it properly.	CHITCHAT
You're supposed to go.	CHITCHAT
Like you're supposed to take the net and send ticket perpendicular to the water.	CHITCHAT
Where the fish is.	CHITCHAT
And then he screwed him upwards and I did not do that.	CHITCHAT
So he flipped out and he got away and I've got awful because I definitely no.	CHITCHAT
Default setting fault.	CHITCHAT
I never taught you how to net post like.	CHITCHAT
But I feel bad 'cause that would have been a really big fish.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So we can't really cut like we count it.	CHITCHAT
'cause he still technically had it on the line and I witnessed it 'cause he's like you saw that right.	CHITCHAT
All the guy I saw that I tried and it it fails.	CHITCHAT
So we had a lot that like got away over the weekend over the week, but didn't catch anything at the damn.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
We're kind of.	CHITCHAT
He was hoping that we would catch something at the damn 'cause.	CHITCHAT
The water has tannic acid in it, so it makes the Fish Golden.	CHITCHAT
Heidi how are you?	CHITCHAT
I have to say this song I'm listening to.	CHITCHAT
It's really nice.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I have a Spotify playlist that you can't hear called Midway called sweater weather vibes.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It's really nice.	CHITCHAT
It's very chill.	CHITCHAT
I think that's almost too harsh, even though these do have a white edge.	CHITCHAT
Take this and let's go light with that sort of still some green to it.	CHITCHAT
Also, I am going ice skating tomorrow for the first time in 3 1/2 months.	CHITCHAT
I'm so excited.	CHITCHAT
My rank apparently has.	CHITCHAT
Has their public sessions back up and going and.	CHITCHAT
I prefer those 'cause there cheaper.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if they're currently, but I asked about.	CHITCHAT
I called Nashville Tuesday.	CHITCHAT
Feels like do I have to pre register for those?	CHITCHAT
And she's like no, we have.	CHITCHAT
Like if you want to you can shows, but they've been pretty.	CHITCHAT
You can walk on to those and I said, I've been pretty crowded goes no maybe 5 people so.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing those, but I have to pre register for any figure skating ice time that I want to use.	CHITCHAT
Which kind of sucks, but like.	CHITCHAT

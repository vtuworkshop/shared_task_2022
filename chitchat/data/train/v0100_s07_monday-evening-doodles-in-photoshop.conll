They have to limit how many people are on the ice.	CHITCHAT
So you can only register 24 hours in advance, which I think is stupid, but that's you know that's their rule.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Then I have a lesson with my coach on Wednesday, so I have to get on tomorrow just to get my.	CHITCHAT
She has to get my feet under me so I'm not flailing around like Bambi on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
Blending technique is on point, thank you.	O
I've been figuring out like painting in photo shop.	O
I'm working on a piece right now for.	O
I'm in a light Gray art lab.	O
Gallery show and the final is due Friday.	O
And I wanted to get it done before my trip.	O
But It was on.	O
It would been too hard to make it on time for that.	O
And it took me until today to really finalize the composition.	O
'cause it's it's a show called World Relay relay relay.	O
I don't know, we let.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
They you had to like essentially like throw the dice for three different.	O
Worlds and you got to pick the one you like the best.	O
And so the one that I ended up choosing was.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Tropical rainforest the theme is pacifist and.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Metal, or like the resources precious metals.	O
Which, like I've never drawn metal before, so this is actually a really challenging piece for me.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
The final was the enlightened final part of it was the enlightened age.	O
If I had to combine all four of those into their own little world, and so.	O
Now that I've been working on.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
As bouncing off some friends like How do I incorporate the enlightened agent?	O
This like I think I think in light data.	O
I think steampunk but like how do you turn it off for reinforcing the steam punk?	O
And I had I had created like a border almost for it, and then make the borders game lightened age part.	O
And it worked out, so I almost finished the border I'm drawing in.	O
Like shiny metal right now and it's it's looking really cool if I say so myself.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So it's I'm having a lot of fun with it.	O
But I have to finish it by the 10th which is.	O
Not Friday, Thursday.	O
Oh snap.	CHITCHAT
I got one last day than I thought I did.	O
So more than likely be working on it after this stream.	O
Family and decided I'm only staying on for an hour tonight 'cause I have to work on that and I can't stream that.	CHITCHAT
'cause they like everything.	CHITCHAT
You kind of Stander wraps until the show premieres.	O
But I want to work on it more and I've been.	O
Recording the time lapse of it.	O
Light Grey Art lab shows are fun.	O

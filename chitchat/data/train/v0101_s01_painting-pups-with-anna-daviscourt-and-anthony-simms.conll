I think they stole no, it was whatever their owner was sad they would bring them a random object basically.	CHITCHAT
And so they brought them like a pine cone.	CHITCHAT
I think it was so cute.	CHITCHAT
So I imagine maybe like potato.	CHITCHAT
Took a potato and just like kept it like don't even try to eat it.	CHITCHAT
Just wanted to have potato.	CHITCHAT
And then I get smaller and smaller.	CHITCHAT
Overtime is just like a wrinkled little potato.	CHITCHAT
That potato lives.	CHITCHAT
The second question is from Joanna asking a bit of a technical question what did or what brush did you use to sketch within fresco?	O
Oh golly, this actually, I think, was one of the new charcoal brushes, but Kyle just really fat, think right.	O
I don't have the iPad with me right now, but if you go on the discord I will happily answer that question later.	O
But I do think it is one of the charcoal brushes that Kyle just released for fresco.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
If not, then it was definitely one of the drawing brushes 'cause I remember finding this one would be like what a lovely texture.	O
Oh, that's very intentional that he gives it this kind of lovely texture.	O
I think now be in the chat saying jello jello.	CHITCHAT
To the chat once again, so good to see ya.	CHITCHAT
Everybody agreed that we should have a pet tab on the discord, 'cause I will make that in a hot 2nd.	CHITCHAT
And if there's any type you want, just let me know.	CHITCHAT
I will build all the tabs, will just have 5 million.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's how it gets in slack sometimes just a million different channels.	CHITCHAT
Gosh well, the discords that I'm on for certain Adobe things like their Adobe streamers, discord and it's a lot of and they keep asking for more.	CHITCHAT
And it's just like as a newcomer, it's a little overwhelming, but when you see it is like it makes sense after a while showing in the chat, saying nice, I'll check it out.	CHITCHAT
Yes, excellent.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, that was another plug for you to have to join the discord to get an answer, but like I genuinely don't remember what it is and my husband is also an artist and he uses the iPad when I am not, so he's probably got it in the other room right now.	O
I was thinking of making him kind of like a cream and alike Brown spots.	O
What do you think?	O
Anthony Freeman Brown spots?	O
Yeah, we can play with different colours, but just as a first pass, what do you think?	O
Yeah, I think that's a bog standard dog design.	O
Reminds me of the Pokey little puppy.	O
From the Golden Books Collection.	O
Give his cream with Brown spot.	O
But yeah, I want him to be just like in any dog.	O
I want him to be a mut, so it's not necessarily like you have to have any colorings or markings.	O
Say me in the chat saying pet tag pet tag tag.	O
Sammy's already just filling it, yes.	O
I'm so jealous of how many pets are at your guys house.	O
3456 Yes, I kept going up.	O
If you count the mouse in the fish.	O
Yeah it keeps going.	CHITCHAT
Come join in the chat saying Haha I totally get it.	CHITCHAT
I'm already in the discord 210 out of 10.	CHITCHAT
Need a pet channel?	CHITCHAT
OK, that's excellent.	CHITCHAT
Yes we will have a pet channel no problem.	CHITCHAT
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
Is this good Brown he likes?	O
He looks like to me some kind of like.	O
Uh, like a oh he's a mocha so he's got like the mocha spots.	O
And then there's like the Milky latte cream.	O
Yeah, maybe you could do one of those designs on his for like the painting with cream.	O
Oh my gosh, cute little heart like.	O
Come down with it or make one of those flashes look more like a potato.	O
More like what is what is that look like, less wobbly lines for me, like a distinct potato, a distinct potato?	O
He is a distinct potato, OK?	O
Kindle in the chat thing.	O
I need to share more pet pics.	CHITCHAT
More pics of my pets.	CHITCHAT
Seriously, you've got such adorable little Bubs Antones	O
So it's just like making random friends.	O
I think that could go in the pet shampoo.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely always animals and its creatures of all kinds.	CHITCHAT
OK, whether you live with them or not.	CHITCHAT
Is that weird?	CHITCHAT
Like we do that for animals?	CHITCHAT
But if you were taking random pictures of like people outside like, here's my roommate, then here's somebody I saw the street.	CHITCHAT
But with pets and random animals outside like there are so many, I was just talking with Anthony about this 'cause he came over.	CHITCHAT
We had a socially distance little hang out.	CHITCHAT
It was cute and pulls especially cute, convey Anthony's outfit.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, can I post a picture of you in the field on the discord?	CHITCHAT
'cause it's really cute?	CHITCHAT
I don't know, maybe will have to come up with like people watching channel on discord.	CHITCHAT
No, don't be an Anthony Appreciation Channel.	CHITCHAT
I am so down for that anyways.	CHITCHAT

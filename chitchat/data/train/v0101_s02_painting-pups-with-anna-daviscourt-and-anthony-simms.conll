So I was telling Anthony I really want to get more pictures of the wildlife around here, 'cause it's really booming like there's a.	CHITCHAT
There's a community.	CHITCHAT
OK, you guys, and it's bustling.	CHITCHAT
And the only problem is trying to first of all catch it because there's like a specifically a muskrat that goes down on Creek and like he's there for maybe 5 seconds.	CHITCHAT
So it's not all set a time to catch him and then other than that, like you kind of want to appreciate the moment and just be like.	CHITCHAT
That's so cool.	CHITCHAT
It's like the spirit of the Creek is right there.	CHITCHAT
You don't see him everyday and you can't tell when it's going to happen, and I don't even bring my phone with me on every walk, so it's a hard thing to actually capture, but it would be so cool to capture it.	CHITCHAT
'cause Oh my gosh, so many fun things live outside.	CHITCHAT
We found a crowd as have like a hatch of babies that they take care of on their underbelly and we actually saw that like a big crowded with a bunch of Little Crawdads underneath it.	CHITCHAT
And it was so magical looking like just in amongst the little brush at the edge of the Creek.	CHITCHAT
So cool.	CHITCHAT
And we've got a healthy.	CHITCHAT
What would you call it?	CHITCHAT
School of fish?	CHITCHAT
These like tiny little fish, but they're all over the Creek and and a giant.	CHITCHAT
What do you call it towed baby?	CHITCHAT
Polliwog yeah.	CHITCHAT
I guess it's bigger than a with the little ones called Tadpoles Castle.	CHITCHAT
Bigger than a tadpole, but not a full fledged frog yet.	CHITCHAT
and I thought maybe it was a plecostomus 'cause it looks like it was clinging to a rock and had a little tail, but Anthony is convinced that that was a polliwog or whatever.	CHITCHAT
I think it might still be considered a tadpole because it didn't have.	CHITCHAT
Catholics are back legs.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but it was so big like Man, I'm not going to make a heck of a toad or frog.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
They balloon after awhile 'cause they have to become big burly fraud.	CHITCHAT
Frogs, kind of the cousin to the bull frog.	CHITCHAT
Frog frogs are the best.	CHITCHAT
I'm sculpting a frog right now.	CHITCHAT
It has a little Lily pad on top of its head.	CHITCHAT
Cute so cute.	CHITCHAT
I've got Kindle in the chat saying I also need pics of the neighbors animals, although all the lambs are grown now.	CHITCHAT
Still lambs but giant sometimes the horses also from a different neighborhood come by and cows.	CHITCHAT
I love it so much.	CHITCHAT
Farm animals have a special place in my heart because they've always been behind defense like I just want to pet a cow.	CHITCHAT
Can I please just stop at the side of the road when I see a farm with calves on it and just put a cow?	CHITCHAT
Is that allowed?	CHITCHAT
Probably not, but I really want to do it.	CHITCHAT
I just want to cattle.	CHITCHAT
But you know, there's certain places you can go to that take care of like rescued farm animals.	CHITCHAT
and I really want to visit one of those too, because I think that would be.	CHITCHAT
I mean then you're just paying admission towards those animals lives and that feels good.	CHITCHAT
Do you know Jenny Nicholson used to work at a petting farm in Disneyland?	CHITCHAT
No way.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Pretty interesting petting farm at Disneyland.	CHITCHAT
I've never heard of anything.	CHITCHAT
I think they got rid of it to make room for other attractions, but she did choose.	CHITCHAT
I don't know like anytime that there's animals involved.	CHITCHAT
I worry about their well being and especially with so many people coming through that could be really hazardous thing.	CHITCHAT
Like you can't always just like kids, especially when if they pull on the tail of an animal and they had like get kicked in the face or whatever you know like it could be a really bad situation really quickly.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's just a negative way of looking at it, but like I want people to be able to appreciate animals.	CHITCHAT
But the most important thing is that you're not causing the animals any harm.	CHITCHAT
So I wonder how that went down, like if it was always a good thing.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure there's always like a one off thing, but by and by every time I've been to a petting zoo, nobody's been like trampled or beating up the animals.	CHITCHAT
Well, OK, at our Oregon Zoo Petting Zoo area, they only admit like a few people at a time, so hopefully that's everywhere where it's not just like everybody openly pet, but I think that my stuff in the case because she said it wasn't a very popular attraction.	CHITCHAT
'cause when people go to Disneyland they are there for the rides and queuing up for the bigger things.	CHITCHAT
And this was more for like.	CHITCHAT
Kids that couldn't go on some of the rides, people that just commit go on rides because it was too intense or whatever, and this was just like a nice relaxing spot for people to just come and chill out a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I'd be all about it, man.	CHITCHAT
Also very small section.	CHITCHAT
It was like a bedroom size, probably with only a few animals from the clip that I saw.	CHITCHAT
The better I think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, in the chat we've got Kindle saying Pollywogg just made me think of that one Pok√©mon and then it goes on to say I put the cows.	CHITCHAT
If they let me usually my doggo scares them away though.	CHITCHAT

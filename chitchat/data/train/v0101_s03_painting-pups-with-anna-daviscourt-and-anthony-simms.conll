But yeah, that happens.	CHITCHAT
And then Kendall goes on to say when I'm at my grandmother's house, if she has cows in the yard, there's lots of pets always cows giving slimy kisses.	CHITCHAT
Apparently there where did we learn that that their saliva so viscous that the cow lick like stays up?	CHITCHAT
It's like a sick.	CHITCHAT
It's not you.	CHITCHAT
Was it all history of that we talked about that I can't.	CHITCHAT
It must've fallen, was involved.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I like potatoes, potatoes.	CHITCHAT
Amazing and I love them.	CHITCHAT
Just the sheer mass of them.	CHITCHAT
What a lad.	CHITCHAT
But it reminds me of one of the other random pictures of pets on the Internet.	CHITCHAT
I saw it was a dog that brings a large stick to what the person called the big dogs which was a bunch of horses behind a fence.	CHITCHAT
It goes and finds the biggest stick and it's like here you go for you.	CHITCHAT
Cute you surround the chat.	CHITCHAT
Saying flu says that someone starts someone.	CHITCHAT
It's my dream dog will patates now he's just a random dog go that I wanted to draw.	CHITCHAT
Like if in doubt, why not make something cute and he came out one day and then actually I think he started with this like little sitting pose and I was like I want a dog without a neck just like a little chunk are you know.	CHITCHAT
and I started drawing with like really bubbly lines.	CHITCHAT
What would you call that like the warble 2:00 AM.	CHITCHAT
And I liked it, so I kept going and I'd say I think that this top one might be my favorite, like this line area, especially around his side is just.	CHITCHAT
It makes me happy.	CHITCHAT
And I sent it to my dad 'cause he was.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
He was asking something about like making.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We were talking about something and I was like this is potato and then he immediately replied with mom loves potato.	CHITCHAT
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen is he immediately shows it to mom and she loves.	CHITCHAT
Obviously my mom would love it.	CHITCHAT
She's just like me.	CHITCHAT
She loves animals.	CHITCHAT
But I live love the idea of my dad showing mom something I Drew.	CHITCHAT
Someday, maybe they'll see this and they'll be like.	CHITCHAT
They'll dad will.	CHITCHAT
Mom would be like, Oh, she's talking about us.	CHITCHAT
Joining the chat asking petting zoos generally have really small animals, right?	CHITCHAT
And then you know Sarah saying I love heading cows and Buffaloes.	CHITCHAT
They are the cutest.	CHITCHAT
If they let us.	CHITCHAT
True.	CHITCHAT
And then Kendall, responding to Joanna depends.	CHITCHAT
I've seen llamas, ponies, and donkeys and petting zoos.	CHITCHAT
It's and then going on about the cow cases.	CHITCHAT
It's like snot, it's gross.	CHITCHAT
But so fun to say hi to cows.	CHITCHAT
I would be down as long as I could like wash my hands at some point.	CHITCHAT
I feel like when I'm going to say like you're going to petting zoo or some animal interaction time like we went over to our friends who had a Puppy Party of borzoi puppies.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, amazing, you just go knowing like I'm going to be around animals.	CHITCHAT
It's gonna get dirty is fine, you just clean up afterward.	CHITCHAT
So if I go to the farm I know that I'm going to get cowlicked.	CHITCHAT
I'm down.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh though.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think that most heading zoos have like medium range so not too small, not too big of animals.	CHITCHAT
One of my favourites as a kid I don't even know if it was really is strictly a petting zoo, but like a farm stands that we would go to every once in awhile and visit the IT was alpacas that they had and there was one called honey that was my absolute favorite and we would just like fawn over her for hours and then one day she was gone and we were like Oh no what happened.	CHITCHAT
She actually had to have surgery done.	CHITCHAT
Emergency because she swallowed an entire Apple Bowl.	CHITCHAT
Wow yeah, so they had to like get it out and then she like she came back but slowly you know that kind of thing so it was.	CHITCHAT
It was a little sad as a little little Anna, who worried about the animals, but it all worked out for honey.	CHITCHAT
She was back and we lavish her with love once again.	CHITCHAT
Kendall Jenner chat saying sometimes the cows thinks raspi a dog is a lost captain come running up to us to see if there recently weaned calf.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes a little scary when more than one follows, there's thankfully always offense between us, though.	CHITCHAT
Oh, definitely yeah, you kind of need defense, especially if it's multiple.	CHITCHAT
That would be scary.	CHITCHAT
Just run up to you, but that is so cute that they're just like little baby.	CHITCHAT
Let us take care of you.	CHITCHAT
What is razy?	CHITCHAT
Think about like Oh my.	CHITCHAT
There are large.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says one of my other neighbors had a llama.	CHITCHAT
His name was MC in his friend.	CHITCHAT
The goat was Jambo Jambo.	CHITCHAT

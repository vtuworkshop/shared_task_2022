Within a jambox yeah yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think that naming animals is one of the most fun things that you can do it.	CHITCHAT
It's like that's imagination time, for me at least I love it.	CHITCHAT
And if you guys didn't see I just did opposed to the other day of the bagels that I baked on Instagram stories, I now have a food highlight.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to go back and look at it, you can.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, I named all of the bagels and gave them like brief back story kind of things.	CHITCHAT
And it was so much fun just to name stuff like I want to name more things.	CHITCHAT
Clearly this is potato that was.	CHITCHAT
You know their name from the beginning, but I just want like more animals, so maybe that's just the impetus to make an entire project of random animals.	CHITCHAT
And then I get to name them all.	CHITCHAT
Sounds like Animal Crossing.	CHITCHAT
It's true my ransomware.	CHITCHAT
Kindle says Razzies always sniffing the ground until she hears them, then she gets a little scared occasionally.	CHITCHAT
Nose kisses to happen though.	CHITCHAT
If you could ever get a picture I would pay you $5,000,000.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh yeah oh I don't have it but I would be it.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, oh I said doll hairs.	CHITCHAT
5 million still.	CHITCHAT
I mean, how many dollars do you think I could find and how many hairs per dollar there?	CHITCHAT
I know.	CHITCHAT
I'm using the trick guys.	O
I'm doing the holding down the littles~ key underneath the escape key to make my brush into an array, Sir.	O
Kendall says naming things is fun.	CHITCHAT
Malvy says my ears and then up dead face and then Kindle says hi, names all the animals that might book the other day.	CHITCHAT
It was fun.	CHITCHAT
I'm assuming you scurry.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I don't even remember 5 seconds, probably squealing about dog.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, it definitely felt that one.	CHITCHAT
It was a guttural all yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And let it go.	CHITCHAT
Kendall goes on to say you still the sticky notes to name the pets Dragons and people.	CHITCHAT
Sticky notes yeah, oh used all this I thought you said you stole you.	CHITCHAT
Stole all the sticky notes.	CHITCHAT
Used all.	CHITCHAT
Awaiting the sharp shock of adult dark dock you remember, Jenna had a thing where she's like trying to teach Kenneth how to it was elocution.	CHITCHAT
Angie said.	CHITCHAT
It's like waiting in the dark of the weight, waiting in the something of a dull dark dock for the of the sensation of short, sharp shock.	CHITCHAT
The rule juror Verger.	CHITCHAT
30 Rock sorry, this makes no sense to you, but 30 rocks.	CHITCHAT
Amazing and you should watch it.	CHITCHAT
Telugu song to say I'll work on getting a photo.	CHITCHAT
It happens too quickly so I never have time to get a photo or video.	CHITCHAT
I feel that I feel that it's with all the wildlife around here.	CHITCHAT
It just doesn't want us till I understand.	CHITCHAT
So I would first inform us.	CHITCHAT
Encourage you to enjoy the moment.	CHITCHAT
Don't worry about capturing a photo.	CHITCHAT
But if you can do so.	CHITCHAT
Invest in a GoPro constant.	CHITCHAT
My life, so for the most paranoid or the avid creature watchers.	CHITCHAT
One or both.	CHITCHAT
Papa Trying to find a good.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is a thing that I've actually been thinking about four.	CHITCHAT
Painting a subject on a plain white background or like some kind of character, maybe with like a little bit of background.	O
Whatever.	CHITCHAT
There are several techniques that people use that I really like to show the depth of a character.	O
Basically think about this pose of potato in the upper right hand corner.	O
You can either make his ear in the back darker like I did on this one one layer, or you can make it closer to the white in the background and it kind of.	O
Saves it back into the background a little bit.	O
I've seen both of the techniques used and probably way more successfully than I'll do in like a few seconds, but it's just something to think about, like how we want to.	O
Render this unnecessarily render, but like just the spectrum, the technique of it receding into the background.	O
'cause this is a point at which we can choose.	O
Darker, lighter, darker.	O
Greater original, darker, lighter.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT

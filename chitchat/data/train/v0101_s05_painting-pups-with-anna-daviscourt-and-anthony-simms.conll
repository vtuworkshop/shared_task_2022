I don't know if I did anything for anyone, but uhm, I think for now I would lean towards the darker.	O
That's just my inclination.	O
And of course, if anybody has questions about any of this stuff that I'm doing, please let me know.	O
'cause if you've watched for awhile, you probably know a lot of the stuff that I'm doing, but I still like.	O
I will totally repeat all the things.	O
If you want to know.	O
Kendall says, Oh, I always want the image, but I'm never ready lol.	CHITCHAT
And then Sammy says ADB always be videoing.	CHITCHAT
Constant video feed.	CHITCHAT
It's important to my life.	CHITCHAT
Kendall language serbo say they like the darker option.	O
Darker, OK, cool.	O
I'm glad you guys agree, uh?	CHITCHAT
What was it?	CHITCHAT
Oh, it was.	CHITCHAT
I was listening to the podcast from the watcher guys, which I told you guys a few times about, but it's a YouTube channel with the guys from BuzzFeed unsolved and worth it and.	CHITCHAT
They were talking about ships in their brain where, like someday they're going to just have.	CHITCHAT
It was like they were talking about Apple Pay like Ryan would just bumped his forehead against like the pay scanner and be like done.	CHITCHAT
And both Ryan and Shane seemed to be very down with our future of being automatized, automatized, could I recall it dipped in the brain where like say you wanted to record a moment that you saw.	CHITCHAT
You could just be like.	CHITCHAT
Obviously this is all like science.	CHITCHAT
The science fiction and all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
But if you were to be chipped in the brain would you be down for it for the abilities or would you be against it and have to go off grid?	CHITCHAT
What do you think, Anthony?	CHITCHAT
A little of both.	CHITCHAT
I'm fine with it being in my phone.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I want it in my brain.	CHITCHAT
Both says you kind of don't mind.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's like our cellphones are basically that like you have your option to video record in.	CHITCHAT
An event or use Apple Pay or Google Pay or a variety of different things are tracking.	CHITCHAT
It's like all of that, but they're just talking about making that smaller an embeddable into your body somehow, and I think that's where I would draw the line of.	CHITCHAT
I'm fine with it being good device, but I don't know if I want it inside of me.	CHITCHAT
They have to track you at all time, which they already do with cell phone right now.	CHITCHAT
Used to carry your yeah.	CHITCHAT
So that's why I say little about like the technology is cool and definitely useful, but only when I want it to be there.	CHITCHAT
I don't want it to be constant.	CHITCHAT
Which is like you going on walks without your phone.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you're actively choosing not to be tracked, or to have the ability to record an event.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise he would just take it with you.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I chose it because I don't want to clean it when I get back.	CHITCHAT
What are you doing to hear?	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm being overly safe about covid, so every time I go outside I touch a door handle.	CHITCHAT
I touch a railing on something and then I touch my phone so I'm gonna clean it when I get back.	CHITCHAT
That's just I think people in general should clean their phones more often.	CHITCHAT
They get.	CHITCHAT
So grab me after just even a week of Houston.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if people really even come clean.	CHITCHAT
Their phones on that often.	CHITCHAT
Ono before this.	CHITCHAT
I've never claimed it, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Uh, and also James is a perfect testament to this because he has a screen protector that slightly up at the corner and it's just gathering all the stuff that gets on your phone against a sticky adhesive and it's nasty, Oh yes, subgroups, but he refuses to get a new one because he's a cheapskate man.	CHITCHAT
Just need him to know I if it's bugging you that much right now, you should just get the right place.	CHITCHAT
Now, and you would hate me saying that about him, so he's not a shoot, he's just a like he doesn't want to go.	CHITCHAT
So back to the chat user said never thought about the lighter option for behind the ear and then Anthony Jackson saying hello chat and then Kindle goes on to say I want to scanner with chip ideal, but I think risks would be easier for scanning so medical updates would be so much easier.	O
My mother and I have lengthy conversations about this topic.	CHITCHAT
Also would be easier to wear a bracelet to protect my chip from malicious people.	CHITCHAT
Corinne in the chat saying I want a dog so bad and I'm sure it goes on to say I neglect my phone.	CHITCHAT
Kindle says I cleaned my phone a lot.	CHITCHAT
Now he also says hello to Corinne.	CHITCHAT
Kindle says there's a phone germ quiz in discord.	CHITCHAT
Really, it is a very handle.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Kendall posted.	CHITCHAT
She says it's from the oatmeal.	CHITCHAT
Oh good, that's going to be very scientific then.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you guys are awesome.	CHITCHAT

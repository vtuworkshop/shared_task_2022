Maybe it'll just up our health factor altogether.	CHITCHAT
I barely got sick before this.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I didn't, you know, get a lot of things, but I feel like I'm going to get less of any illnesses after this because I know for a fact that this is going to be your like residual habits.	CHITCHAT
That last probably my lifetime of just like.	CHITCHAT
Being not I don't wanna call it paranoid, but like this to some people paranoid and I'm fine with that.	CHITCHAT
Like lean into it man, I don't care, it's not hurting anybody.	CHITCHAT
But especially mask wearing if you feel like you're sick, I think that's just a smart thing that we should all adopt.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna try to keep that like Warbly line that I got in the initial sketches, but just seen it a little bit so that it's a designed warble, you know.	CHITCHAT

Three years I mean, obviously after this is all over 'cause we would never get together during this, but just imagining, like I don't know I, I just haven't seen my entire extended family in quite awhile and so I feel like we're due for another really big get together.	CHITCHAT

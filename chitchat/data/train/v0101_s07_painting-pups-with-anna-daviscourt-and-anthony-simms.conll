It was uhm, making Christmas cards with a bunch of other art students for a good cause.	CHITCHAT
It was for like a organization that advocated for children in court, Casa si ASA.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, we were all sitting around.	CHITCHAT
Anthony wasn't there unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
I wanted him to be.	CHITCHAT
But I was sitting there with some of my friends and one of the people who was working with us like teaching us how to use certain equipment or whatever she comes up and just says like, oh hi, what's your name?	CHITCHAT
Nice to meet you and I was like.	CHITCHAT
Hi, I'm Anthony.	CHITCHAT
Indiana She just broke down crying.	CHITCHAT
Clearly I was so hung up on the fact that Anthony was not with me for one moment in my life.	CHITCHAT
Drive into existence through me.	CHITCHAT
Little did I know he was at home having a seance trying to nap.	CHITCHAT
Anthony came through.	CHITCHAT
Yes, that story has haunted me for years.	CHITCHAT
The random instance of not using your own name as anyone else ever experienced that.	CHITCHAT
Is that normal?	CHITCHAT
I'm sure it is somewhere right, right?	CHITCHAT
This one time I said I was Anthony Davis court.	CHITCHAT
So embarrassing, could you imagine it's record?	CHITCHAT
Record it for the rest of my life?	CHITCHAT
Well, it's perfect because it wasn't even calling it in Anthony Davis court like you are misquoting your last name.	CHITCHAT
It was because it was Anna Davis court.	CHITCHAT
So you're misquoting my first name as yours, which is consistent with this whole story that my name is Anthony.	CHITCHAT
So it comes full circle.	CHITCHAT
There we just keep pushing it that way.	CHITCHAT
It's really, Steve Ross says.	CHITCHAT
Vigilance, current says, looks like a Tibetan spaniel, plus dachshund.	CHITCHAT
Did I accidentally make an actual breed of dog?	CHITCHAT
Kindle says.	CHITCHAT
Using more people and so many cells, I've had so many dogs, students with cute food names, but none named potato.	CHITCHAT
Yet we gotta get a potato.	CHITCHAT
Says he So I feel for in size one of my favorite stories.	CHITCHAT
Kendall in Tiraspol say Lol and then Kendall goes on to say sometimes at Starbucks.	CHITCHAT
I say I'm batwoman or pick some other name.	CHITCHAT
Love it, take the power, it's yours.	CHITCHAT
Corinne says Haha, one time I nervously met someone named Irene.	CHITCHAT
Oh she was she OK?	CHITCHAT
Continue.	CHITCHAT
She said my name is pronounced currin, not Corinne, but she said I dream.	CHITCHAT
And so I said, I'm Corinne.	CHITCHAT
And then I paused and said, actually, that's not how you pronounce my name.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why I said that.	CHITCHAT
You know exactly what you said, that 'cause your frame is great just like ours.	CHITCHAT
Make Chris current goes on to say Haha next part you do.	CHITCHAT
It was it posted yet you do face?	CHITCHAT
Hey hey, no fighting.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says it's fun.	CHITCHAT
Also fun, I think that food names for dogs or pets in general are the good way to go personally.	CHITCHAT
But Anthony, we've talked about this before 'cause you grew up with pets with human names basically, but they were kind of like after characters.	CHITCHAT
No, they're just human names.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I guess that was here.	CHITCHAT
But I mean Casey in Charley and Tracy and Lily, all those ones I don't think were named after anything specifically but Thelma and Louise were named after the movie.	CHITCHAT
The movie dumb movie Maui says they met in the bathroom.	CHITCHAT
What o'curran Irene thing was that part of their story?	CHITCHAT
Not to my knowledge.	CHITCHAT
I don't know where that bathroom part came from.	CHITCHAT
It's fine, sometimes the weirdest meetings that you have with people just happen to be in the bathroom, and that's OK.	CHITCHAT
No, nothing comes tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
Or something?	CHITCHAT
What I'm saying like I've not met anyone in the bathroom.	CHITCHAT

Something about when your food has more color in it has more antioxidants in it.	CHITCHAT
Like think blueberries, being purple and purple potatoes have more nutrients.	CHITCHAT
I was thought like more color on the plate is better, just 'cause you're usually the most colorful things are vegetables and fruit because I know like when you know you have a really lazy deep-fried meal.	CHITCHAT
It's just Brown.	CHITCHAT
If it is just like OK, where is the color?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I never thought of that like the deeper the color, the more nutrition, but it makes sense for like kale to the dark leaves like very deep color.	CHITCHAT

I've seen that on YouTube before where they like I hate pink for a week and I feel like purple would be a better one because it occurs in nature much more readily than pink Kindle goes on to say purple cabbage, purple carrots, purple potatoes, purple fruits.	CHITCHAT

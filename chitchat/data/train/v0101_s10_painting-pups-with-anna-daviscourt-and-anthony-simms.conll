and I was talking to James 'cause.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we have this ongoing discussion about getting out out.	CHITCHAT
Take what do you call it?	CHITCHAT
Take out backwards.	CHITCHAT
Ordering food a lot of people have been doing that since the beginning of Covid and have been totally fine, but he is also still scared that somehow it would be contaminated or just of our chances of risk.	CHITCHAT
Basically it's like why would you risk it for something that's a luxury.	CHITCHAT
So I thought today maybe we could get some different ingredients to kind of switch up the profile of tastes that we can create in our kitchen and then branch out to new dishes.	CHITCHAT
And maybe that would kind of fill the void of what I'm missing.	CHITCHAT
A lot of it is Thai food.	CHITCHAT
I just crave Thai food specifically.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I need some sprouts, and maybe that's just my body telling me what nutrition it wants.	CHITCHAT
But anyways, that's what I'm craving right now.	CHITCHAT
I don't know about you guys.	CHITCHAT
Are you craving anything in particular who sell berries?	CHITCHAT
Captain Crunch Cereal?	CHITCHAT
No, we know your favorite cereal of all time.	CHITCHAT
Go ahead.	CHITCHAT
It Oh Gosh, it was Lucky Charms with all marshmallows taken out but put into.	CHITCHAT
What was it?	CHITCHAT
Pretty pebbles, fruity pebbles, fruity pebbles with marshmallows from Lucky Charms, so it's lucky pebbles.	CHITCHAT
There you go lucky pebbles or fruity charms.	CHITCHAT
And I discovered that fruity pebbles already had a brand or cereal that had marshmallows in it.	CHITCHAT
Trolls from one box and put them into the other.	CHITCHAT
That wasn't dedication and I got pictures of the hallways.	CHITCHAT
Rooms wanted it so he made it happen, but now I'm having a craving for oops all berries, berries.	CHITCHAT
Well, it's true.	CHITCHAT
You know, even if you have a favorite of something, that doesn't mean you want it all the time.	CHITCHAT
So oops, all berries.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to get you some looks like we're 10 minutes away from the end of the stream.	CHITCHAT
We just catch up on chat real quick.	CHITCHAT
As I have too many pics on my phone now, I clear it every once in a while trying to be good and backing it up to my drop box and Kendall it goes on to say out take of that take out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but it it.	CHITCHAT
No, Anna remembered.	CHITCHAT
It's been 10 seconds or more and she remembered progress.	CHITCHAT
Kerr incest.	CHITCHAT
They make these prefilled pouches for Thai dishes.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says or wait.	CHITCHAT
Current goes on to say they are pre sealed in all of that.	CHITCHAT
I like it because you don't have to buy a whole container of spice for one fish.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says I'm praying Vietnamese noodles always and then current says the Kindle Yummy and Kendall says my mother and I eat out at the place almost every other week.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
My mother and I eat.	CHITCHAT
Out at the one place almost every other week in your service says I'm craving Japanese pop food.	CHITCHAT
Oh, Japanese like the hot pots.	CHITCHAT
See, that's another thing you can't really get that delivered because it's an experience, but you're doing.	CHITCHAT
You're cooking it with everyone at the restaurant you know, so that's.	CHITCHAT
Probably where people are getting really strong withdrawals from having things like that social food outings.	CHITCHAT
Yes, Ricoh Santa say in the Vietnamese pho or fat?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and then Kindle says what this is too short of a stream.	CHITCHAT
We only do it hour on Mondays.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry Kendall, but thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's really nice.	CHITCHAT
Handle says I want more Japanese Curry.	CHITCHAT
I ate all of mine.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, yes, So what are the most recent things I did was did a chickpea Curry kind of Indian style?	CHITCHAT
What would you call it?	CHITCHAT
Like a tomatoe dish with rice and that was one of the most fun things to do because it was outside my comfort zone and I need more of that like just to diversify in general, my taste buds thank me like we just need more different food.	CHITCHAT
Joanna saying, I tried vegan Greek at lasagna the other day and holy smokes so good.	CHITCHAT
Amazing how is I've never thought about it like an vegan too.	CHITCHAT
I mean yeah, yeah, so I could either do not die after.	CHITCHAT

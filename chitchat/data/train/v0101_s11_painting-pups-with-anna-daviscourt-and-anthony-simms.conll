It's been too long.	CHITCHAT
Japanese Curry is more miles from Indian.	CHITCHAT
But both are excellent.	CHITCHAT
Youstra says.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to get the recipe right and the ingredients and make a Japanese.	CHITCHAT
Sukiyaki and now I'm craving and Kendall says I'm craving both.	CHITCHAT
I'm craving all the things you guys.	CHITCHAT
I'm just hungry now.	CHITCHAT
Oh but this is more chance to get in the discord.	CHITCHAT
And if you make any of these things, post them today.	CHITCHAT
I didn't have time to post before the stream, but I will the ROM.	CHITCHAT
And then I just made for us for lunch today.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, we didn't have any Roman noodles for so long.	CHITCHAT
And then I finally just ordered them online from like a different purveyor.	CHITCHAT
And got like a bulk about it was awesome.	CHITCHAT
So I finally made my dream Rahman today and it was a I gotta.	CHITCHAT
Have you had those eggs?	CHITCHAT
Why do they call their like soaked in soy sauce?	CHITCHAT
Another photo?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's like a not 100 year eggs but like 10 year eggs.	CHITCHAT
No, I don't know what the name of them, but I know what you're talking about where it's like seasons hard-boiled seasoning.	CHITCHAT
Basically, yeah, really good and sometimes they like half it and put it in Rahman tissues.	CHITCHAT
Well, I've done hard boiled in Rahman dishes and usually I do show you Rahman because I'm vegetarian.	CHITCHAT
So the broth is well now.	CHITCHAT
I've kind of made it my own which I use better than Bouillon brand vegetable base, which if you haven't found that and you're vegetarian, get it.	CHITCHAT
Will change your life.	CHITCHAT
It's so good.	CHITCHAT
And as like a nice earthy savoriness, and before it was a lot more salty and I kind of had to learn how to balance that.	CHITCHAT
I also use me so which is very salty as well.	CHITCHAT
But uhm, all that to be said, it's just one of those things that like.	CHITCHAT
When you find a good Rahman suit based broth recipe, it's like changes your life.	CHITCHAT
That's something I look forward to eating every single time.	CHITCHAT
It's so good, but this time I added egg to the broth as I was cooking it, so I poached the eggs in the brow, and then I put each egg in each bowl and then there are a little bits of like a still in the broth.	CHITCHAT
And so I mixed it and it becomes like part of it.	CHITCHAT
Makes it creamier and then I put the broth on top of the noodles and all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
and I also do fresh carrot, very thinly sliced at the bottom and when the hot broth goes on it it softens the care.	CHITCHAT
It just a little bit and it's almost like.	CHITCHAT
I usually do that with cabbage as well, but it's just a little Christmas to the dish and then you know vegetables.	CHITCHAT
Fried tofu got another Chris Element and a green onions and sesame seeds like all the good stuff.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Nice just ate it like few hours ago, but I want it again.	CHITCHAT
Now he says lol now I remembered a fun story about that in the bathroom and then it goes on to say I entered a bathroom at a restaurant.	CHITCHAT
That guy was having trouble.	CHITCHAT
Let's say literally said sorry when he heard I was washing my hands.	CHITCHAT
Poor dude.	CHITCHAT
I mean, yeah, I understand that.	CHITCHAT
But like oh, that's just you can't control what happens to you.	CHITCHAT
You know is not somebody's fault.	CHITCHAT
That's just sad.	CHITCHAT
All you wish in those moments is that you could have a private bathroom like to sound rude.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Kindle says Japanese country food is different from the more well known sushi types of food in it's been so long since I've had any current, says, Oh Man, I love ROM and one of my favorite foods kinda goes on to say I also that reminds me it was supposed to be Nearish Meow Wolf and now I want to know what's going on with that place.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, have you guys heard him yell Wolf Anthony?	CHITCHAT
Do you know what that is?	CHITCHAT
No, Kendall goes on to state.	CHITCHAT
By the way, if anyone goes to Santa Fe once Covid Nightmare is over, go to meow Wolf best.	CHITCHAT
Most fun place ever.	CHITCHAT
Twilight Zone Plus welcome to Night Vale.	CHITCHAT
Plus Peewees Playhouse equals meow Wolf, but in person.	CHITCHAT
That's why you are sorry.	CHITCHAT
Driving it in the chat, let me describe it.	CHITCHAT
I'm so excited now.	CHITCHAT
No, it's so true.	CHITCHAT
It's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Google it please?	CHITCHAT
'cause it's awesome.	CHITCHAT
When I went to 99 U two years ago, uh, one of the creators of meow Wolf was one of the speakers, and that's how I learned about it.	CHITCHAT
Like from the creators mouth.	CHITCHAT
And Oh my gosh, like their presentation of it.	CHITCHAT
Just I was literally scribbling down like what would I make if I could make anything happen as an experience and like I came up with this whole idea for like what my meow Wolf Experience would be, but there's this so freaking cool.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, I want it to be in Portland.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it would just work so well here.	CHITCHAT
I want them to expand to every city.	CHITCHAT
So cool.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, yeah that was my room right?	CHITCHAT
More like an endorsement ringing endorsement of something I've never actually been to.	CHITCHAT

Being alone, they exist?	CHITCHAT
Oh no see having a personal experience, yeah, I feel like you'd immediately be like, Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope.	CHITCHAT
Not messing with that.	CHITCHAT
But I like Kerans answer or she's like with someone like we've talked about this before.	CHITCHAT
She's like if I had a pet, I would feel safer because I think at least it would be like you're protecting the pet.	CHITCHAT
So you get stronger, like somebody breaks it, they're not touching my baby.	CHITCHAT
OK, so like suddenly I'm diving for that knife a lot faster, but you know, it's it's just time to make some ghosts.	CHITCHAT
Catch phrase.	CHITCHAT

Shannon says, Hey Corinne, it went well and then Johanna says there's some places like in Australia and I just that seems so unnecessary just in case the Ghost Havoc Raj.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely yeah.	CHITCHAT
If if you've ever had the experience with them, I feel like it an immediate like you don't mess with them because.	CHITCHAT
But then you have the feeling like they are real, so I think it majority of the time it comes down to that.	CHITCHAT
I've never personally had an experience.	CHITCHAT
Have you, Anthony?	CHITCHAT
Yes, she says I watched Commission you to draw Teddy Anna your doggo illustrations are so cute and then people goes on to say.	CHITCHAT

China says I used to watch ghost hunters obsessively and watch live ghost games.	CHITCHAT
Then I was home alone and heard glass shatter and someone was breaking in.	CHITCHAT
Went out to say hello because of course a robber would respond.	CHITCHAT
Turns out my BF's bulb on her fans shook off and crashed to the floor and since then I have not been able to watch scary things at night.	CHITCHAT
Understandably, yeah, I don't think I want to watch scary things ever, but especially not at night.	CHITCHAT
On washer like we've been talking about, there is a new show that they put out called are you scared where they just read crazy pasta stuff to each other?	CHITCHAT
Well try and read this is Shane and the recent when they read they said was actually a true story and Nope just I am so if that's a true story, I'm out like oh gosh, it's so scary but they always say at the beginning of the show like turn out the lights and like hopefully it's stormy night.	CHITCHAT

I watched it in the morning while I'm eating breakfast next to James like I feel so safe so that I can listen to scary things.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, Kendall says I'm mostly scared that I'm going to turn my house into a haunted house.	CHITCHAT
Because I accidentally buy some haunted objects from a flea market.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, yes.	CHITCHAT
All the haunted things like oh, that's gotta past.	CHITCHAT

He could tell Anthony's feelings about that definitely haunted, definitely creepy, and they're just in these boxes.	CHITCHAT
And sometimes she opens up up and they're just laying in this like tissue.	CHITCHAT
But you can't deny their beautifully made like they're crafted.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, sure, I could appreciate the craftsmanship of it.	CHITCHAT
But still creepy.	CHITCHAT
Actually, even say I'm like I'm going to make a ghost, but this is probably because I was scared of slappy from goosebumps.	CHITCHAT
Oh is that a doll story?	CHITCHAT

I didn't read this website there, but it was a marionette kind of think like Chucky style where it's evil doll that wants to kill you.	CHITCHAT

Something about it is it disconnect from actual horror movies for me, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it doesn't feel like it's trying to make you scared, it's just that those things would happen.	CHITCHAT
If you know those dinosaurs got up, but so that ends.	CHITCHAT

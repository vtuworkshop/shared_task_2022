That's not scary, right, children?	CHITCHAT
OK, that was one that I absolutely loved but scared some of my friends.	CHITCHAT
I was Hocus Pocus.	CHITCHAT
I remember a few people being like oh, I don't like that and I'm like I don't know like but his mouth sounds like that.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, um potato is a lovely little pepper Ann were going to paint his other poses sometime, but I'm very happy with just this little hanging thing we did today.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to the sketch and let's talk about food.	O
So what do you all need?	CHITCHAT
Wait before we talk about food?	CHITCHAT
I just have to get these last comments out of the way.	CHITCHAT
Joanna says.	CHITCHAT

Anthony, what are you making tonight tonight?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We did a Costco order today and have that delivered so there could be like potential stuff for dinner, but we haven't planned anything out tonight.	CHITCHAT
There's some cauliflower rice that is taking up space in the freezer that I think we should try to get rid of.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so maybe something that steamed veggies, maybe some sort of protein in there.	CHITCHAT
We got some chicken Nuggets.	CHITCHAT
Chicken Nuggets are just good with everything.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, chicken Nuggets.	CHITCHAT
We have vegetarian ones for me, but they are so dumb cable and so delicious.	CHITCHAT
I don't think we have any plans for our dinner, but basically I made my dream dish for lunch that Rahman really hit the spot so dinner doesn't matter as much.	CHITCHAT
You could have at least one really good meal a day, don't you think the other ones can just take a hike, but like you know one just star but every meal is an opportunity to make something that really.	CHITCHAT
Helps you along, uh?	CHITCHAT
Like makes your mood better, makes you happy.	CHITCHAT
I think in smoothies for dessert so that 'cause we got some psyllium husk powder finally after not having it for awhile and I usually put that in smoothies and it helps with digestion alot.	CHITCHAT
Now he says, uh, maybe pizza.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what to get today.	CHITCHAT
You know, says I don't care what I'm doing tonight for food yet.	CHITCHAT

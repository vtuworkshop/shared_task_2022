That took awhile so that we got there.	CHITCHAT
OK, well we should probably call it.	CHITCHAT
I know we should go 10 more minutes and make this an hour and a half.	CHITCHAT
No, really.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we're only 10 minutes drive an hour to paint more golly, OK, we're going to go as fast as we can on this one.	CHITCHAT
Will make one of the next ones this week.	CHITCHAT
An hour one or just continue the trend of an hour.	CHITCHAT
Now that is really up to you and the chat.	CHITCHAT
I have no place in this decision making.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says this is the third time since foreign team started that I've had dreams about something that just randomly happens with the same subject to the next day.	CHITCHAT
The llama one was weird.	CHITCHAT
Dreams about llamas.	CHITCHAT
Next day, llamas apparently can save us from coat fit.	CHITCHAT
I may think you're creating our reality.	CHITCHAT
James had a series of dreams that he said were very, very hard to wake up from because every single time it was that he would wake up again.	CHITCHAT
So it's like you wake up in your own bed and you're like, oh.	CHITCHAT
I'm waking up and then he's like, wait I can see Anna out of the doorway.	CHITCHAT
That's not how our apartment is like.	CHITCHAT
He would never be able to see me out of the doorway and so he's like this isn't real.	CHITCHAT
And then he's like I had to start like punching myself to wake up and I was like dude.	CHITCHAT
You have control of your dream and you're like, Oh God, I get outta here.	CHITCHAT
To the window and take a flight into Sky.	CHITCHAT
I want to wake up.	CHITCHAT
He wasn't like thinking oh I'm dreaming he's just thinking I want to wake up so well I guess that's a lot but The thing is guys train yourself this is the way that you do it if you want to become a lucid dreamer is you look at something that's either words or numbers.	CHITCHAT
Read it and then if you read it again and it's not the same order then you're dreaming that's like how people train themselves to always think like am I dreaming right now oh let me look at the Clock it's 1201 and then you look at the Clock again and it's like ABC.	CHITCHAT
Like Oh, I'm dreaming.	CHITCHAT
So people just start that habit when they're away, can it carries them into their sleep?	CHITCHAT
And so I told him, like hey, next time don't hurt yourself please.	CHITCHAT
'cause what?	CHITCHAT
If you wake up in the real world and you just start punching yourself?	CHITCHAT
But anyway, is, uh, that was an interesting little.	CHITCHAT
Like Dream experience that I've never had.	CHITCHAT
I've never been like waking up and then wake up again.	CHITCHAT
The only time I was ever stuck in a dream I was really scared 'cause the guy from Jack in the box tops singing opera.	CHITCHAT
And then came after me and I was like, Oh my gosh, like the big headed one where it was like a big bubble up and so I was screaming at the top of my lungs.	CHITCHAT
Why God?	CHITCHAT
I eventually did you know, his catch phrase was probably time to make a ghost.	CHITCHAT
No, it sounds like Dunkin' Donuts, like it's time to make the Donuts, but like it's trying to make it go.	CHITCHAT
Sammy says I proved I drove it til Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Johanna says an hour and a half has been the new standard for Adobe AP AC, so you know facts.	CHITCHAT

So that would really help.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says inception time.	CHITCHAT
Current says let's all dream together.	CHITCHAT
Guys will start will stream overnight lol and then kinda stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm always jealous if my dad's dream see always ends up flying and lucid dreaming while flying.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, that's so cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you ever lucid dream and you're like really in control and get to do stuff awesome anyway, so this is the discord.	CHITCHAT

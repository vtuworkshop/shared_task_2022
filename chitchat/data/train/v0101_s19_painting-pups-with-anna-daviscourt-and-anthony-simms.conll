Well, thank you for spending this time with me Anthony and everyone on this chat journey.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, let's see.	CHITCHAT
I think we've just been consistently kind of painting on these guys, but I guess I'll flip again through.	O
Where are layers so that we can see what we did?	O
We got Mashed potato anyways, so this is the main paint layer.	O
But before that what we did was we laid down a base layer of gold and then I put some layers on top of that.	O
Actually it's just one layer of cream and Brown that I clipped to the yellow layer below it and then I put the line layer above it so that we could color it and kind of use that as part of the painting 'cause I don't want to lose the line.	O
I like the line.	O
And then we added a soft light layer with tons of fun colors.	O
Let's go to normal just to see what that is.	O
So like blue gold, uh, a little bit of like a muted red and set that to soft light.	O
And there you go.	O
Well, punch of color and then.	O
When we see this guy oh you so rough up suddenly painted.	O
Look at that smooth fluffy boy.	O
He really does feel like mashed potatoes in my mind like his entire body is just covered with a thick coat of fluffy fur and must exactly what I wanted.	O

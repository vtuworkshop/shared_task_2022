I've got the uh XT file open is this is a Taco delivery app that Saturday I'm working on.	O
She's got a brand new document up on her screen in illustrator.	O
I got the XP file.	O
We are using Co editing if they'll be XT to work together, she can just drag and drop files for copy and paste files from illustrator right into this document for me to pull into the design.	O
She can come here anytime and edit any part of this document.	O
She can start typing or Dragons around and I'll see her move things and he's talking it.	O
Fighting is super useful when you need him.	O
You need to have like 2 designers in a file at the same time.	O
Kobe Sear too high Kobe.	O
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, uh, we use it to work between her.	O
You doing all of the kind of branding and art elements and I'm doing with design so.	O
That is what we are doing.	O
Uh, let us know if you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I think we're pretty far along in this process.	O
I'm going to go ahead and hit play on this.	O
You guys can see what we got going on course.	O
It's full screen, so it's going to.	O
Do the thing.	O
At that.	O
There we go.	O
OK, so we got our.	O
Main sort of page singing.	O
Lord of the Afghan roll tacos.	O
Address search.	O
Colored locations by you, um, things we need to work on our connecting this map screen to the different take out.	O
Delivery menu On screen here and then just check out screen.	O
We need it.	O
We basically do connect everything together because the last time that we worked on this we work primarily on this little.	O
Delivery sequences are chords here, so the little delivery map.	O
That traces the line and then transitions over that.	O
There's a little bike.	O
Little Bell Sound.	O
I don't know if you guys can hear that the last time that we tried to play that for you all.	O
Broke The audio in my stream so.	O
Yeah, so all gone.	O
Got some older people alone.	O
Join Sic, shared in another another streamer so you got Colby's shared in both.	O
Also launching bonding and so I've got a full House today.	O
So I think we've got a couple more icons for Sarah to wrap up.	O
I gotta couple that.	O
I need to pull in mostly the sort of back buttons and check out buttons here and I'm going to work on just kind of wiring all this stuff up together.	O
Place I've got is pretty well thought out.	O
We're not going to go all the way with this and make this like a complete.	O
A completely flushed out kind of AB or just kind of doing a minimum viable product here and then.	O
BP, which is this map, the menu and the check out process for Taco delivery company called properties.	O
So also to give a shout or Ryan who suggested that we use this yellow circles tortilla, which was really an idea.	O
So Ryan if you got any other brilliant suggestion was no.	O
Sharon saying, it's my first time visiting your stream.	CHITCHAT
Jeff Watson had been made himself into just keep missing yet yeah, that happens.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I missed a lot of streams of it like I just I don't know or I'll catch.	CHITCHAT
I have this terrible tendency to catch Ryan like in the last 15 minutes of his live stream.	CHITCHAT
It's a yeah.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I have terrible luck catching people when they're going right so.	CHITCHAT
I cannot wait.	CHITCHAT
Sorry Sir, I'm just like talking away.	CHITCHAT
If you have anything you wanna talk about what you're doing over there on your screen, let me know.	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
Well, not really doing anything yet, but kind of just a quick like re introduction of everything that we had.	O
We did like a sample artstyle we came up with some icons for the different categories for the menu that we made.	O
We came up with the spicy meter.	O
I don't remember who suggestions a little Peppers were but I think we went with that.	O
And we have a checkout icon are back button and we need to finish these topics.	O
So I'll be tackling those first today.	O
If you when you get a chance if you could throw the I don't think I have an XT file.	O
The back button or the.	O
How do I do?	CHITCHAT
OK, and I'm right here.	O
I just wasn't over far enough to see.	O

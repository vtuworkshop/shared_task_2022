You guys.	CHITCHAT
Perfect this is IRA work in that I don't remember.	O
Is it thick enough.	O
We'll see I could always just full line waiting next uses it keeps the stroke weights from it.	O
Keeps the path this strokes so I can actually adjust it if I need too.	O
PST file when I scale everything down so.	O
Should be good, but now we have that issue at first.	O
Think the inside strokes for cheese stick and everything was kind of blending together on these.	O
Yeah, I dropped those.	O
Yeah so I had dropped those down.	O
You can see that little one.	O
I think the inside line weights we made like 25 or something like that.	O
Stop.	CHITCHAT
You tell me at .5.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I mean, we kind of Lucky Arrow to be heavier anyways, 'cause won't be able to see it.	O
So yeah, I figured.	O
Popeye's chicken last time.	O

But I, uh, we have to go make that and I'm currently working on this app on.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
He answered.	CHITCHAT
We could turn this into a cooking live stream and I keep on making more than anything.	CHITCHAT
Make apps about food majors.	CHITCHAT
Make the food or the drinks in this case.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I need to just make a disclaimer that not everything that I make is food really.	CHITCHAT
Although a lot of things that make our food related, because if it's a personal project, I mean what like issues.	CHITCHAT
Why not?	CHITCHAT
We're not making about food.	CHITCHAT
Flight delayed.	CHITCHAT
Have an agreement.	CHITCHAT
I love food.	CHITCHAT
So much.	CHITCHAT

Understand evening of 'cause you're OK.	CHITCHAT
Eating there.	CHITCHAT
Hurting her, if I remember correctly.	CHITCHAT
I believe.	CHITCHAT
What can you do?	CHITCHAT
What size and height?	CHITCHAT
Anybody have any questions for either Sarah or I only say to ask?	CHITCHAT
Want us to answer one about what we're doing?	CHITCHAT
Uh, as conveniently we possibly can.	CHITCHAT
I was just gonna say I will Babble their major answer how it be sometimes.	CHITCHAT
I totally know what I'm doing.	O
I used illustrator every day of my life.	O
But you do.	CHITCHAT
We do that I do.	O
Oh Well this is not.	O
Yeah, I guess it is close to the same size.	O
Sweet.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if anyone else can tell, but I can tell I'm lagging.	O
Like my illustrator is slightly.	O
It doesn't look like it's lagging, so I apologize when I can see from here from my screen, but it might be lagging for you.	O
I've had that happen before were like.	O
It doesn't visually look like it's lagging, but you can feel like it's not.	O
Not moving as fast.	O
I like it hot upon since been a slow being all day today, yeah.	O
Yeah, it's not I'm looking at.	O
I'm watching you work now and I don't really see much of a lag on our end.	O
It just might be.	CHITCHAT
I've had that happen before when, especially when I'm using the same peak in illustrator.	O
It like will.	O
Uh, last behind the path that I'm drawing.	O
I don't work that way to everybody on the live stream, but it will like I can feel it but it.	O
Yeah, I can definitely feel lagging.	O
I feel like every time I select something it like it takes the 2nd.	O
It's not like super distracting.	O
It's just weird.	CHITCHAT
Hindering I should say.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well I wow.	CHITCHAT
When I got the funds for it out, now I wanted to figure out the state I want to use for the active.	CHITCHAT
The inferences active state for the map markers.	O
He may have suggestions, the place I left this at the last time and I remember like not being unsure about how I wanted to handle it.	O
Where I left off.	O
At last time essentially was the.	O
Which I had.	O
With these little circles behind it, and I'm not sure that that's the right way to go about handling it, I would need to make up.	O
We need to make that clear that like this is the icon for the the location that is selected in some way.	O
So we've got this yellow one.	O
Maybe there's a couple of things you hear that this yellow one which is supposed to represent.	O
Or location and then the blue ones are representing the restaurants and then the dots behind.	O
We added sort of as a temporary solution for highlighting the rush up and you have selected.	O
I like the idea of Talian this little circles.	O
Maybe it's just a matter of changing with colors so that the blue is the one that represents.	O
Um, your location and yellow 'cause the yellow would match the tortilla color.	O
Then you still have to figure out how to handle the fact of steak sauce.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
I feel like this is where we got stuck last time, right?	O

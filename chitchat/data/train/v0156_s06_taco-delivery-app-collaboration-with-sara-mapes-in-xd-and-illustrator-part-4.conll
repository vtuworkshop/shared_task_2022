Yeah, and it's just I don't want to go ahead and like I'm like why are up these screens until I figure out what these if I need to like reset these icons, change them.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Steven's saying can't help your laggy audience and slightly choppy.	CHITCHAT
My audio hours.	CHITCHAT
Sarah's audio.	CHITCHAT
Colby, for some reason, whenever anybody tag your name in the chat on getting well like MoD approval, warning that they need to approve your any messages with, I don't know what's happening.	CHITCHAT
Might that might be something we need to ask the.	CHITCHAT
So my group about 'cause That's very strange that everything tagged with her name is getting flagged.	CHITCHAT
Say your audio is choppy.	CHITCHAT
Audience mean.	CHITCHAT
Unknown.	CHITCHAT
I never knew that.	CHITCHAT
Are you hard wired with the Internet?	CHITCHAT
All you did not do that yet.	CHITCHAT
I have not done that yet.	CHITCHAT
'cause I moved for my desk.	CHITCHAT
It's so perhaps.	CHITCHAT
That might be the problem, yeah?	CHITCHAT
I was not hard.	CHITCHAT
But OSC, however it was not hard wired in last time either.	CHITCHAT
Interstate saying this, I'm going to have to figure out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
7 to say that my audio is good, so uh, no must be.	CHITCHAT
It's either your headset or your or possibly or.	CHITCHAT

Then let me choose a different location.	O
He appears there, indicating that's the one you selected.	O
Yeah, we need.	O
We definitely need some way.	O
I'm just like I'm wondering if there's a way to tie it into the I guess that would work.	O
Taco man is made out of Global Tortilla Shell and so that would kind of visually play it back to the.	O
Tortilla shell containing all the information at the bottom, so maybe we could use and I like Bull Taco man so that we could add that next to the little icon to indicate that's the one that we because we don't have our little talks about on the screen anywhere so.	O
Let's see a.	O
My only concern is, uh, just the size of the line work.	O
If I get kind of cramps.	O
Too small.	O
So I'm only active state.	O
I made this button that components so there's an active state tap on it so.	O

So yeah, I might have to change the line weights because it's gonna get a little bit.	O
Squishy That's too small.	O
What?	CHITCHAT
There always seemed strange trees.	O
Cheese Not rolica block of cheese or something.	O
I don't know how to show that.	O

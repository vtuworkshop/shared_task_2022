Yeah, all fun.	CHITCHAT
He told you sing.	CHITCHAT
So it's nice she combined.	CHITCHAT
It's hard as you EXE projects.	O
Bottom illustrates the elements and stuff without having.	O
Or having the illustrations done already, so it's nice to be able to work with somebody else in the same time so that you could do more.	O
Uh, but Sarah is gonna be starting room doing their own thing.	CHITCHAT
She'll be live streaming on Behance and you'll be able to go go subscribe to her, be hand school like holding hands for awhile and you will get notified when she goes live so you can check out what she's doing on their stream.	CHITCHAT
Do you have any plans for what you want to do?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, well, first of all, thank you for having me.	CHITCHAT
A second of all my only plan so far are going to be hit you a probably start streaming my design for all of my stream stuff like my schedule an.	CHITCHAT

Stuff.	CHITCHAT
That's it so far so.	CHITCHAT
Yes, yes you have to check out there.	CHITCHAT

Is there anything that you want to say?	CHITCHAT
In my No, not really, just thank you again.	CHITCHAT
This has been a wonderful experience and I very much enjoyed it and your best.	CHITCHAT
Jenna saying sorry guys, I'm confused who's doing the UI part uhm?	O
Technically I was working in XY here, working on the well.	O
Both of us really.	CHITCHAT
I guess concerns you on the Internet.	CHITCHAT
You do go under the elements.	O
It was kind of a joint effort, so we kind of developed the brand first.	O
And figure out the kind of styles everything.	O
And then I did some wireframes on the first day and then the added are.	O
Little icons in art and things up as we kind of went along in the style of the interface.	O
Basically just kind of.	O
Form from there.	O
Yeah, it was kind of derived from the brand name is Saturday, then the icon.	O
His stuff like that so I can.	O
I know it's right combination about Tim saying the question is who isn't?	O
Can I see you?	CHITCHAT
Uh, yeah it was a group effort.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I said to see a lot.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of in my mind.	O
It's hard, it's sort of weird for me because I don't separate out.	O
And like I said Before, I'm just not really separate out.	O
The things that I do is like separate individual skills.	O
There's like an overlap and everything they do animation, illustration, design like it's all just kind of one in my mind it's all just like these are the things that I do and they all overlap intermingle with each other in various ways and so it's hard to separate out and say like yes as a UI designer.	O
These are things I'm responsible for because all kind of.	O
Once I don't know.	O
We probably agree with animation that, like you don't really separate out.	O
Like yes, I do this one thing and that's what I do.	O
I guess there are jobs out there where people do that kind of stuff.	O
I just it's not not by the way.	O
A little.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I agree.	CHITCHAT
I completely agree with that at all.	O
Kind of overlaps.	O
One skill leads into something else that leads into something else and you just like I, I've learned all of this and it all kind of goes together.	O
Yeah, I mean, there's certainly going to be things that you're going to be like.	O
Enjoy more or you're going to have more practice or experience doing.	O
But I think that like, yeah, I think so.	O

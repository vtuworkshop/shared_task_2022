We're starting off with something much simpler.	O
I am going in and I am grabbing through these colors from these photos.	O
And I am using them sparingly.	O
I'm using them to create new illustrations.	O
Now.	O
Part of the reason I do this is but it has a bar as a bird to heed what's up, man, welcome to the stream.	O
I'm doing this because it's it's like a really good way to start a really good way to come up with ideas.	O
And you know, and it really helps me, kind of.	O
Really understand how color schemes work together.	O
If you're on here and you're watching them, and I know that you're on here, and I know that you're watching this, 'cause otherwise you know Jonah in the Woods.	O
Happy, heard or seen by anybody.	O
Then you probably shouldn't art and you're interested in color as these things kind of go hand in hand.	O
I will admit that when I was, uh.	O
But but, uh, we college student.	O
I kind of wasn't that interested in color.	O
I kind of like really interested in like black and white illustration or or 3D design, and it was only interested in painting or anything like.	O
I deeply regret this.	O
I think part of Maine knew that I would regret it.	O
Oh, I need to show my Smart Tools.	O
Watched.	O
Which face?	O
Extensions will timeline as set this up real quick so that you guys can follow along with me on the goals.	O
Our tool capture.	O
There we go.	O
Became more bigger, we'd begun.	O
I kind of skipped past it and I wish I had stuck with it now.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But in doing these it really loosens me up.	O
It takes me do things that it teaches me about.	O
One of those things that you came here to learn about which was color.	O
Because colorism, mystery and the way it balances is a mystery and often really good art just hits us.	O
And it's just like.	O
Is spectacular and it kind of draws us in in grid art.	O
Can be alluring and.	O
And you don't know why.	O
As it turns out, it's offered through use of composition and color.	O
This is.	O
To welcome you this my stream about color about opposition.	O
And we're going to experiment.	O
We're going to play around and we're going to see what it is that we really like about this mysterious thing called color.	O
And how we could potentially wield it in interesting ways.	O
To do this, to start off with, I am grabbing colors from this.	O
Image here.	O
And I'm just experimenting with applying these colors onto my own.	O
Pallet now you might notice some similarities in general composition because I'm kind of drawing some compositional ideas from this, but in general I am not.	O
Creating That was him seeing on the screen I in this little picture in fact.	O
Shortly I'm going to remove this.	O
I mean, shortly.	O
I mean within like a couple minutes.	O
I'm going to remove this image.	O
Is the great over here.	O
And we're going to paint paint freely, and the idea here is going to be basically really checking out like what are these colors?	O
How do you actually interact together and How do I use these colors in one of my own compositions?	O
To create something original and cool.	O
Never before seen.	O
That's my jam.	O
Jimmy jam That's where we're at.	O
So if you are one of these 16 people in this room, or again, maybe some 16 people, maybe just dying or 10.	O
I can tell because I don't know how to read this counter.	O
I'm going to choose as soon as the higher number 'cause That's more exciting to me.	O
But I want you to join in.	O
This is going to be really fun, I'm like.	O
Pretty aunt to get into this.	O
I do this one yesterday.	O
Much more kind of kind of like.	O
Basic Browns with blue and I base it on this picture here.	O
Um again, I don't have.	O
Much of an agenda as to the ones that particularly use what's up.	O
Awesome nikolina low.	O
Welcome to the stream.	O
I'm kind of just at the moment I'm going to nature to try to.	O
Figure out because nature has what we humans sometimes lack, which is complexity.	O
And things are always a little bit more.	O

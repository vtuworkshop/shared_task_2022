Is this more variety of colors and we kind of assume there would be etc.	O
So it's really good places heart because basically any given photograph will yield any number of colors.	O
And with any number of colors will provide you so much.	O
Like information to kind of invent and creates, you know from there.	O
Exceed C I'm also following here.	O
I'm making up the Instagram incident.	O
Jonah Goof is Tigran incident of 2020.	O
It Wicks Texian Journal Lobe.	O
And it ever be rectified, used to say.	O
But this is a start.	O
What's up?	CHITCHAT
Awesome call Dixie has a burger.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is great and welcome to everybody else who's here.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go ahead and if you notice, if you look at my key pallet, I'm kind of just doing a lot of color sampling.	O
I'm holding down the alt button and just color sampling these, and I'm trying to get like just I'm trying to pick up.	O
Colors and I'm distributing them kind of across the board a little bit across the whole scene a little bit.	O
And I'm doing it with a little bit of movement.	O
But I'm playing nearby that is.	O
I'm creating movement across across my palette, so this is not quite a landscape peace.	O
UM hoops But I am having it follow some kind of landscape E feelings.	O
So that is to say it seems to have some kind of Horizon Line.	O
Past the middle here.	O
There seems to be some kind of paling of light.	O
But it's a little unclear, right?	O
It's like what's what's, what and that's fine.	O
And actually it's very much my intention is I don't want to create anything that looks like anything else at this moment.	O
I'm open to that.	O
I'm very open to that and if if we go along and we start basically that that's kind of ends up being what we start doing.	O
That's great, like we start inventing new things, but at the moment I find it is something intensely gratifying and kind of subtly.	O
Both both learn things about art and learn things about myself and what I can do with art.	O
When I do exercises like this so often, what I'll do is I'll kind of grab these certain colors and I'll put them in somewhere like if I just, you know, if I just experiment with what is it like to have just look up little speckles of orange over here?	O
It's pretty cool.	O
It looks a little bit like splash off from everything else so.	O
Reply that I can see what that does for Maine.	O
And you know.	CHITCHAT
We don't know yet like what they will yield or if it will look natural in the grand scheme of things.	O
But Am I concerned about that?	O
Create a little bit more of his breakage.	O
Some of these lines when I first laid these colors down, some of them were very hard.	O
Edged them and very soft edge and I'm going to be blending like this.	O
Just color sampling from the area, blending, pulling that color him and see what happens when one things bills into another.	O
Is often we get these very cool.	O
Movements.	O
When we do that.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT
I know what that sound is.	O
I don't know part of the background sound little town.	O
Of some of these sinking lower line.	O
I want.	O
In some of them.	O
I'll take it.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT

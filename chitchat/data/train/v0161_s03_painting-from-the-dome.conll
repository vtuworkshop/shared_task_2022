I'm doing like a live stream.	O
There you go, that's what you want.	O
People, people moving in next door.	CHITCHAT
But I wasn't as this woman in Bolivia who.	CHITCHAT
Work next door.	CHITCHAT
Choose mosaicist she moved elsewhere on this floor.	CHITCHAT
And so she just moved out.	CHITCHAT
And so nobody had the spot, but apparently literally like two days later, AKA today.	CHITCHAT
The moving in.	CHITCHAT
I have neighbors again.	CHITCHAT
They're just moving in large amounts of art supplies.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
I like them.	CHITCHAT
What's going on with the values here with like these kinds of this, this kind of white.	O
This white light here and I think that's.	O
That's what's going to do after me and I feel like it really creates this feeling of Sky.	O
Much of what it is.	O
It's kind of doing it, but it's kind of like giving a cloud or something.	O
I'm not sure I'm going to kind of go with that.	O
Over here.	O
Like ends up in general, like up here, not entirely, but just like into these kinds of blobs.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then that way I can hopefully create this really cool dramatic like.	O
Sky Sky scheme that necessarily isn't necessarily there in the actual picture.	O
But What is something of my own design?	O
Something I really like for that which I really want to pursue?	O
Is.	O
This.	O
Like kind of gradient gradients.	O
So basically take these colors in the background.	O
Here is sample that it kind of painted in, just gently and it kind of creates a feeling of like home.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Want to put this whole canvas?	O
I find especially when creating works far like this that are like kind of have these different they are like.	O
Almost like like Scott, you like landscapes or whatever.	O
These compositions that kind of are made up and kind of go in different directions.	O
If you don't flip the cannabis from time to time.	O
You might lose out.	O
Kind of on what on like on the way it slanted often what happens is that something apiece you draw it with your left hand, and then after a while you flip it and you realize, oh man, it looks like it's been drawn by somebody falling over to the right while I go to the left.	O
Our arts they basically have a handedness, right?	O
It could be left-handed, right-handed, etc.	O
And if we don't put it back and forth, we're going to lose out on that.	O
That like.	O
Directionality right?	O
So going forward, I want to focus a little bit on like the contours of the light.	O
On the shapes of the shapes of things, basically so excited to create right now, where it's kind of a muddy.	O
I can model of.	O
In a value in points and all that, I'm just going to start to try to smooth things out and I might not do that in the same way for every picture.	O
But I'm going to be basically, but this one.	O
I'm feeling it because I like these big Boeing shapes like the movement of provides.	O
I like it, but I'm also going to just pull them down.	O
Kind of in movies lines in We do the same with the red and drag that around.	O
Now I could go zoom in in here and focusing on these little areas, but at the moment.	O
Truly the best thing for me to do would be to zoom all the way out like I'm doing now.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of like get a feel for how things could be laid out.	O
Because only when I kind of settle on a big.	O
Larger composition.	O
Will I know for sure?	O

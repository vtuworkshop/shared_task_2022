What's working, what's not?	O
And then when I know what's working?	O
What's not then I can go from there and I can design an invent and expand.	O
This again, let's focus on these big shapes.	O
I like this kind of curling.	O
Out is a movement away.	O
Resumed out there we go.	O
I just did what I said I wouldn't do, which is I've zoomed in.	O
I like this and then I'm going to have this kind of even arcing out further across here.	O
That creates this kind of like billowing cloud look.	O
Oh my, my head is like all over the camera apologies.	O
Remove the camera back.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And with this up.	O
By the way, so we have about 40 people watching so far.	CHITCHAT

Don't hesitate to let me know I'm here to answer questions.	CHITCHAT
I'm here to hang with you.	CHITCHAT
That was so nice about having live streams.	CHITCHAT
Is it you don't have to watch this as if it was YouTube video you can answer questions, ask questions.	CHITCHAT
You can say what's up, you can interact.	CHITCHAT
You and I are hanging out together in real time.	CHITCHAT
Over here in the US is the 4th of July.	CHITCHAT
Which is a holiday.	CHITCHAT
But I'm working because I am an artist, there's no rest.	CHITCHAT
Or the broke as they say.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
No, but seriously, though, I actually I have a one year old daughter and so the last year I haven't been able to get at the end to work as much as I like.	CHITCHAT
So honestly, I relish the ability to go into the office and when I'm here on the Adobe Channel is that I get to do I get to come in and I got to make art and what kind of part do I have to make?	CHITCHAT
Nothing.	CHITCHAT
I get to make whatever I want, that's what that's what Adobe reports.	CHITCHAT
Mean has always had been doing honestly.	CHITCHAT
If you don't know me, I'm not familiar with back in the day I used to stream on Adobe Twitch Channel.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT

But Yeah, Adobe is always.	CHITCHAT
Literally, they've never.	CHITCHAT
Once.	CHITCHAT
Told me what to stream.	CHITCHAT

And they pay their people Z brush.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if anyone here is familiar with the brush.	CHITCHAT
That's a program.	CHITCHAT
Not made by Adobe.	CHITCHAT
I quite like Z brush, but there people do not support the fans nearly as much or there.	CHITCHAT
They were like how we loved your work on the Adobe channel, which income stream for us, and I was like yeah, sure.	CHITCHAT
How much do you pay your streamers?	CHITCHAT
And they're like, Oh no, we don't pay.	CHITCHAT
But you know, exposure.	CHITCHAT
I was like get get outta here get outta here.	CHITCHAT
I did it like once.	CHITCHAT
It's like kinda find anything like didn't do anything for me.	CHITCHAT
I'm like OK, I'm giving you free advertising.	CHITCHAT
And they were very picky about how I did things etc.	CHITCHAT
Not Adobe.	CHITCHAT
I worked for Adobe on a secret project, or.	CHITCHAT
A year and a half after I finish streaming for them can tell you what the project is.	CHITCHAT
To this day, I can't tell you.	CHITCHAT
I worked with a great guy over there at Adobe who actually has since left he retired.	CHITCHAT
But But the really like the feeling there was really of like.	CHITCHAT
Creativity, like reading tools for people like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, it was very.	CHITCHAT

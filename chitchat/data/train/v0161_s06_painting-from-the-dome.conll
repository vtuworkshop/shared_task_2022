Thanks girl.	CHITCHAT
I believe some of this tangerine down and around.	CHITCHAT
There is a real freedom for me in this exercise.	CHITCHAT
I am very wedded.	CHITCHAT
To realism As an artist.	CHITCHAT
I am dedicated so much of my education towards.	CHITCHAT
Drawing things as they are.	CHITCHAT
Or drawing things as in the most realistic way possible, and what I've come to understand over the course of Mycareer is.	CHITCHAT
While that can be impressive in some regards, it is not necessarily.	CHITCHAT
Make for amazing art and in fact, although I get the more I think to myself, Gosh, I am learning a lot.	CHITCHAT
About how to do more with less and how to.	CHITCHAT
How to invent?	CHITCHAT
And not have to worry too much about whether or not the thing that I'm inventing is realistic.	CHITCHAT
Um, because it doesn't matter as much as is it affecting.	CHITCHAT
If there's any fans of gate video games out there.	CHITCHAT
And you might know what I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
I mean some of your favorite games might not look realistic at all.	CHITCHAT
And so many of these games that strive for realism.	CHITCHAT
Are not.	CHITCHAT
Like that worth remembering, you know.	CHITCHAT
You heard it here first folks.	CHITCHAT
The real world is overrated.	CHITCHAT
The art direction in the real world is globally as best.	CHITCHAT

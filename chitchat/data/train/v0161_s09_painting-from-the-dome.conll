I mean, this is.	CHITCHAT
This is the hardest, right?	CHITCHAT
Like this is the hardest when they can't do anything from the cells.	CHITCHAT
Although once you start running around I guess you're going to have your hands full.	CHITCHAT
Whoops Thanks.	CHITCHAT
But still though, it will be still be really super fun.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I've got these colors now.	O
I've got this new assortment.	O
Grab this thing, it is that there's a value there.	O
Now I'm trying to not just grab these little black spots and I'll just put them here and there.	O
You know these are like it's like.	O
It's like reality, disassembled, you know.	O
I like that.	CHITCHAT
Might might have have.	O
I don't want to have just horizon here.	O
I want to have like some kind of action going to bring some of this green up.	O
Up the side of the painting like this.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'll bring green to the middle.	O
I'll bring some of this more of these kinds of.	O
And you see, I'm filling in the blue I don't want anymore that blue in there.	O
Now as I go, you might think yourself.	O
Oh, it was cool before, and now he's wrecking it, you know?	O
Don't think that.	O
We're just getting started.	O
So here we have, oh, you know we have this kind of silvery.	O
I might be the same color as the Sky, more or less.	O
Let's say it's more or less the same color as the Sky.	O
But the thing we have just just be aware of, so I'll put a little bit down there over this blue down there.	O
Little bit of this other kind of blueish color alright.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Now I'll hide the photo reference.	O
I'll put this image a little bit.	O
I will be going for something a little bit more.	O
I don't just something different this time.	O
A different feel though.	O
I like this kind of tall.	O
Earth monolith thing here.	O
I like that yeah, I did that thing that looks cool and maybe I'll just end of butter.	O
Sit by adding more.	O
I'd like Aladdin one over over here.	O
A short one right?	O
And then I'll add one like here and maybe I'll make it slightly different.	O
I'll add these ringtone out, total changes in them.	O
Then here's we had this kind of like Mountainy things, but I don't need those.	O
Be mountains, but I do like that you know The thing is when we use certain colors, turn value shifts and all that and we moving reference from photographs.	O
Our eyes know what is an image from my balls, except for assemblage of.	O
Color and light braved when we do the same thing.	O
We bring the same thing into a photograph, and we bring in the same colors.	O
Our brain might still parse these things at distance thing.	O
So again, like grab more of the city stuff.	O
City stuff kind of maybe in the middle distance.	O
And then add that again.	O
But I can now use these colors values to create a feeling of depth.	O
Let me create if that kind of sales down through here.	O
Hey, maybe I'll create multiple.	O
Have there may be a little too symmetrical.	O
Beware, symmetry is not always your friend.	O
It's been a piece of Art.	O
In fact, oftentimes symmetry and egg loot the power of a piece.	O
This from this image.	O
Despite this black here.	O
Now if it is or not.	O
But I don't hate it.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to continue to use.	O
My background, I'll rate difference tall entities in the back.	O
Then we start to create this pattern of repeating shapes.	O
I think that would be cool.	O
Skip this these cities in the back.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Moving across the middle.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Way to continue to nurture these like high rise style.	O
Gross.	CHITCHAT
And this is exactly by the way, like how like you can create like really cool original like.	O

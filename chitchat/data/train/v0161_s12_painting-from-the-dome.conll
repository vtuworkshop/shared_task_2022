Good luck with your brush, Rahman.	CHITCHAT
No, I'm not going to use too many this hard edge rushers in the background, so just to keep the background and it from looking too crisp.	O
Should look like the background you know.	O
We put this horizontally.	O
All right, this time to look a little lopsided, I'm going to take this darkness here.	O
I mean expand my my reach.	O
I'm going to create a little bit of shape here.	O
Some other kind of prong shape.	O
Action.	O
Going to.	O
I think it had to balance this.	O
Probably a little bit of action down here.	O
Get this kind of.	O
Early.	O
Alright, I want to get.	O
As you have how to balance things a little bit?	O
And it makes things look.	O
Like Not to last sighted, you know.	O
There we go, including little bit of shading, kind of on the other side or whatever foliage this is.	O
Something like that, I'm not sure.	O
Will be almost 99.	O
Total views by thanks for coming and thank you to the 18 people hanging out.	CHITCHAT
It is a pleasure to have you.	CHITCHAT
It is a pleasure to be had.	CHITCHAT
By you.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Bing is is there like almost like a like brambles they like.	O
Still register as paths, but they're kind of Rambly.	O
Not necessarily go anywhere.	O
Like that it creates miss.	O
Bum bum bum bum.	O
I can blend in this color here.	O
This is still like the whole thing is tilted a little bit like a ship.	O
So I'm just trying to figure out, like you know, so it's all like this.	O
Yeah, right this orientation.	O
But they how do you balance against that exactly?	O
And so I think the answer really is, it's got to be something.	O
Let me bring out like this color here over here so I'm gonna bring a little bit of that in.	O
Background a little bit.	O
That color as well.	O
I braced with that over here.	O
It will be more.	O
Balancing action.	O
Yes, that's nice.	O
But I'm going to create menus this green and I'm going to maybe.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Language like having floating shape, kind of.	O
Check is balances, counterbalancing just the right way.	O
Maybe this one needs to be less.	O
Chooses baby.	O
Listen here.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
OK, because.	O
Base with that this this this blue around.	O
I will bring some of this blue back.	O
I like how it's fading in here so I'm going to lend that in.	O
To do that kind of mix things up in the background, then loop things, see how things mixed together.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Like that it's kind of hugging this mean this mean.	O
Our source of tree, whatever it is.	O
But I got guys I got.	O
Gosling's Ginger beer Right now.	O
That sugar boots with my uncle.	O
That He slipped out.	O
Wow.	CHITCHAT
I can do the trump drink ready.	O

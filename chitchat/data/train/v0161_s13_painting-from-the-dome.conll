There we go OK.	CHITCHAT
Now let me let me zoom out for a second.	O
There's a reason we zoom out here is because it.	O
It allows us to kind of see the whole thing from a distance and kind of figure out what's going on.	O
What's not, Elias asks, are you using a reference picture or from your mind?	O
I use this picture.	O
And I color sample from this picture.	O
I grabbed a bunch of colors from this image.	O
And I using it.	O
I'm using those colors to build this fictional.	O
Space.	O
Before I had this picture.	O
Then I use this these colors to build.	O
This.	O
But you're not very careful.	O
Um, this wasn't very cool because the colors are so dramatic.	O
To rain here is too.	O
Do the same exercise.	O
But with this?	O
So the question really becomes.	O
What is my central thesis?	O
What am I doing here?	O
What do I want this to feel like now I think in looking at this and looking at bringing this up, there's something I really like.	O
What's going on and that's just kind of horizontal growing sensation, so I'm going to emphasize that I'm going to start pulling this white.	O
Down to the image.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
On a really drag it in.	O
And pull, and I'm trying to create this verticality for the peace.	O
And I think that verticality is kind of was very attractive about this.	O
You know, the idea here is we're trying to use these colors, create a very particular.	O
And the question is what is that feeling now?	O
How does that feeling manifest and what is the essence of that feeling?	O
If you were.	O
That's from a kind of how they wait, I believe.	O
There we go.	O
I'm going to grab these colors.	O
I'm going to drag them down in.	O
In I'm going to have more colors.	O
I'm going to drag those colors down a little bit, and I'm going to start create this feeling.	O
Of growth, so we have almost this kind of network of.	O
Roads or something?	O
I don't know what they are, the kind of lay along the ground.	O
But You have this, then there's something growing up and out.	O
From the space.	O
There we go.	O
I'm going to really start pushing that a little bit.	O
Well, I'm going to do that is going to start lowering.	O
Some of the terrain.	O
You know, kind of Flatting it out.	O
Bring it across like this.	O
I'm going to have other things kind of punching up over it.	O
So specifically.	O
Forms are overlapping on other forms in one particular direction.	O
Not in all directions like before, but in one particular direction.	O
That's how we're going to create this feeling of upward movement of us.	O
Rotate this image again.	O
So it's a little.	O
Uneven, but it's coming together, but more.	O
I think that part of that is that we have to match some of the.	O
The brightness is.	O
That we have going on other areas.	O
And then we have also match their contrast.	O
So again creating this.	O
Elder here creating lower downward movement I can create or.	O
Vacuum here.	O
This unified some of these colors into one shape.	O
That When you start to see these things kind of start coming together, it's very exciting.	O
Very much like wow it there before.	O
There was nothing and now there are things.	O
What's up with all the things?	O
I'm gonna push this little bit back into the background a little bit byte by darkening it up.	O

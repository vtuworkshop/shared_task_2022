And I can create all about cradle ball over here.	O
But nothing too sharp because sharp edges catch attention.	O
And this is kind of off to the side, so I don't totally want.	O
So much attention.	O
So much focus.	O
On this shape.	O
And actually, I might even take this.	O
Other color kind of just this, reduce its overall contrast and thus reduce the wrong power.	O
Yeah, let's continue to draw lines down through the environment.	O
Really emphasize.	O
Too many of these shapes.	O
And simplify.	O
That's one thing we forget as artists.	O
Or that it's easy to forget, especially as you continue to belabor particular project.	O
Simplicity is paramount.	O
This really works more than anything.	O
Very effective.	O
I know what these lines are, I don't want that line.	O
I leave them with this line.	O
Yeah, here we go.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
As I said at the beginning of the stream.	CHITCHAT
If you are interested in you want in what you're saying and you want to see more, you want to follow along.	CHITCHAT
Whatever I dropped me follow through on Behance, you happy to have you.	CHITCHAT
Jump on.	CHITCHAT
When I make when I do these compositions, I want to do all kinds of other Art 'cause I've done a lot of different art.	O
You're on the stream, I've done last time I was here.	O
I did a slightly different thing.	O
Which is we did these compositions.	O
And this was more using this cartoon character that like we're doing this large illustration which is super fun to do.	O
And again we did it using kind of starting from a very basic perspective.	O
Where the you know what they are, I know there.	O
There and then also, we've done outright illustrations here on stream, so if you guys were around in Selma Selma early, earlier, streams.	O
Something like put this together.	O
We put this together together.	O
And I never finished it.	O
Actually, I still need to finish it.	O
I'm happy with it, but I still need to finish it.	O
And then we also last time we worked to create.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Compositions based on like feelings.	O
So we use little character.	O
Ain't quiet, his character of my creation.	O
And we started using him as a subject for some of these.	O
Feelings, feeling or a word here.	O
This word was void.	O
How do we create a feeling of avoid not just by drawing a thing, but by drawing a composition?	O
This cozy Ride.	O
I think this was like intimidation or something and then we got better and then we started doing even more with it.	O
We got started going Vertigo and we tried two different kinds of Vertigo.	O
And you know these little thumbnail drawings can do an enormous amount.	O
The teachers about the potential of a larger piece of work.	O
On completion.	O
Weathered.	O
And then we made this drawing and we expanded it.	O
Into this chart.	O
This was super fun.	CHITCHAT
They did here at the behest channel with you.	CHITCHAT

Because it forces me into a very unique headspace, but I get to then invite people into.	CHITCHAT
You know it's very helpful to set about learning and try different things.	CHITCHAT
But oftentimes some of the best learning occurs when we don't really even try.	CHITCHAT
We're experimenting and we're giving ourselves permission.	CHITCHAT
Screw up.	CHITCHAT
If you know me.	CHITCHAT
And how many of you do if you know me, you know just how important I think it is to have.	CHITCHAT
To be free to screw up, let me try a different camp.	CHITCHAT
's house?	CHITCHAT
Yes, that too close to me.	CHITCHAT
It's too close.	O
How's that?	O
A bad.	O
A little bit at hanging in the background.	O
There we go.	O
And then I'll just drag my little camera off to the side a little bit.	O
Because it's all this a little bit.	O
Yeah, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Bum bum bum Hum.	CHITCHAT
Hum, hum.	CHITCHAT
Doctor Seuss, Doctor Seuss this up just a little bit, right?	O
What does that mean?	O
Means curves?	O
That means.	O
Wiggles Nothing here should be so rigid.	O
And perfect that we can't go in here and add some more like.	O
Fluidity?	O
Go in there and do that that fluidity.	O
Let me add some of this.	O
Highlight blue around here.	O
Yeah.	O
As some of that attach it there.	O
Like a zoo statuses.	O
And I really hope that out.	O
I'm going to create, yeah.	O
I might be just a little bit too dramatic of a difference.	O
I'm going to go ahead and blew it down just a bit.	O
This so doesn't totally steal attention.	O
From our kind of center, this whatever city were in here.	O
I'm gonna grab this darker color or just kind of brush it a little bit more to the exterior of bits just a bit and I like this or I don't see that fits.	O
I'm going to add some of this color.	O
Kind of throughout the center here just so I have a little bit more integrated.	O
It is I see I saw that this was the only color left.	O
Of its kind in the image and I was like, oh.	O
A save that species before it dies out.	O
It could be useful.	O
Create variety.	O
Another thing that I find very helpful about things like this and about color referencing from pictures etc.	O
Is that it makes you stay away from those primary colors?	O
Those dramatic, clashing primary colors, but all are the hallmark of.	O
The uninitiated, when it comes to color.	O
I am.	CHITCHAT
I'm working in colors for years now and I am still pretty uninitiated.	O
And so I find that color control is sometimes beyond Maine.	O
And I, but if I'm restricted.	O
By the colors in the photograph.	O
Honestly, sometimes that sets you free.	O
And if anyone here familiar with the concept of restrictions to the you free.	O
But it's it's quite effective.	O
Often when we are tasked with more restrictions, we end up being more creative without restrictions, and we were given too much freedom become quite overwhelming.	O
I don't know because I've had that feeling.	O
But that was what I was talking about earlier with regards to the.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
What's the weather like for?	O
Diner The restaurant diner fact.	O
I should I should call it that she called the diner effect.	O
I should call that effect now is I just called your term.	O
I know love you guys don't know me or.	CHITCHAT
And who I am or.	CHITCHAT
Whatever, but I am a art educator.	CHITCHAT

And I just stumbled on a term that I'm going to incorporate into my art education from here on app.	CHITCHAT
The diner effect two many options.	O
That's real.	O
We have too many options we can.	O
We can fly off and some other random direction.	O
Never know quite how to handle it.	O
The diner effect.	O
Not bad, not bad.	O
That's what it is, is what it says.	O
Not only a.	O
Teacher, I'm also a client.	O
So the only issue we have at the moment with this tree here and that is taking a kind of the middle of the image, is that it doesn't quite.	O
Draw attention in maybe the ways we would expect or want to see from it.	O
It's so far as it, uhm?	O
It's not boasting colors we haven't seen in the rest of the image, and it's not posting shades we haven't seen the image.	O
It's kind of actually being pretty neutral in tone, as everything else.	O
That's fine.	O
Then they have to be dramatically different.	O
But it we do need to know that you know when we're trying to forge.	O
A center point of interest in a piece.	O
Behooves us to use dramatic colors.	O
Untrust So we want to make sure that we.	O
Brasa opportunity when we get it.	O
That would bring this.	O
Gray around.	O
And then we use some of this bright color here to fabricate a little bit of what's going on with these black areas.	O
And just like.	O
Now just kind of created a little bit, a little love in there.	O
There we go.	O
At cool.	O
Like it's getting the sense of like kind of growth.	O
Nothing is growing up around this.	O
That's cool, I like that.	O
Boom Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Both.	CHITCHAT
And everybody here, by the way, is a follower of Aura Watcher or fan of critical role critical role.	O
Finally just shown their next episode finally.	O
This is the Cobit.	O
And I think.	O
FA.	O
Use my art.	O
In like during the break.	O
And they always show off an art.	O
I think I did.	O
Savannah Little God, I think it got shown.	O
I don't know.	O
I haven't watched the episode yet, but I think it got shown and that's exciting.	O
Here we go Wiggles.	O
Number Doctor Seuss.	O
Lego Lego.	O
Understand little bit.	O
Here's a little bit of his white.	O
So it's not quite so bright.	O
Pull over that down a little bit more of a nice.	O
You know contrast.	O
Get that kind of is too much white.	O
Kind of Mary.	O
Is it kind of?	O
Movie I in directions we don't want.	O
Alright, so now I'm using contrast here to make some design decisions.	O
Create a movement form.	O
And just really.	O
How to create enough visual interest that this center becomes suddenly worthy of our attention?	O
That's the goal, right?	O
As we need.	O
Are you going to do piece of art?	O
It's good to know, kind of where the focused's going to be.	O
And to do that?	O
Or as a purposeful action on our part is artists.	O
And this goes for, you know, whether you're a cinematographer, a photographer.	O

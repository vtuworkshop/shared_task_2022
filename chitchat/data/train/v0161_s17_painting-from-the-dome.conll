An artist.	O
Of any kind.	O
Sculptor.	O
Being able to know and understand where the tensions of the viewer will be.	O
Be able to manipulate that.	O
And then focusing on those areas is.	O
But gives you so much power.	O
As an artist.	O
And these colors very slightly.	O
So that this black for this near black can kind of read through.	O
And it's interesting ways.	O
There we go.	O
Let's rotate this one more time.	O
And then soon we should start another one I think.	O
Is there anybody out there who would?	O
Who has any ideas for what they would like to see in a?	O
You know what kind of color scheme that they would like me to go with?	O
You have an idea.	O
Please do tell.	CHITCHAT
No, it's quiet group.	CHITCHAT
I would come to realize better than Adobe thing.	CHITCHAT
Twit on Twitch people just.	CHITCHAT
Chatterboxes chattering along.	CHITCHAT
People tend to be more observant here.	CHITCHAT
Why is it observant?	CHITCHAT
Big fat Quiet type fares.	CHITCHAT
Bring who?	CHITCHAT
Now here's a question.	CHITCHAT
Oh Wonder if I can bring.	O
Some of these Blues down around the outside.	O
It makes the whole thing feel.	O
Native.	O
Share that's that's even cooler.	O
'cause that seems less like a like a normal landscape and more like A.	O
Gonna Blenders Thunder stand.	O
And more like a.	O
Like this whole thing is contained or held.	O
It's like a little City Park.	O
It's out of a head of lettuce.	O
What a cool idea.	O
There we go.	O
Got this this late here.	O
And this will go in front of that, maybe around a little bit, but then maybe around that is when we have this kind of circle of white and we can bring some more of that around here.	O
And maybe even if we get rid of so much of the exterior, we get this kind of.	O
Contains feeling that's kind of what I'm going for here at this point.	O
It's funny how you can kind of just create an invent.	O
And just play and end up creating something that is like kind of area unexpectedly fun.	O
Art, am I right?	O
Hey.	CHITCHAT
An art crazy.	O
I said it all.	O
I kind of dig.	O
2.	O
Bigger.	O
Single.	O
I mean, I don't know.	O
Alright, bring that line down.	O
And then the spring, this brightness around.	O
Mavis brightness around.	O
There we go.	O
Yeah, this is kind of fun, right?	O
I'll zoom out once you can see it this whole thing kind of contained.	O
We started to look like a world.	O
In a little contained little space.	O
That is a turn.	O
All right, and if this whole thing is contained in some kind of world space, well then I want to create.	O
Some some things.	O
The lie that you know some kind of heads of lettuce, other kind of in the foreground here.	O

The really.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Now I know where these lines are coming from or why they're coming shooting into this head of lettuce.	O
But I dig.	O
I think that they are.	O
Nothing about this makes sense, and yet I love it all.	O
Continent.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's more buds.	O
Of action.	O
Bing.	CHITCHAT
Boom boom boom.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
On that around.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I like this.	CHITCHAT
I had just a little bit more this black right here 'cause its area of high contrast and this kind of this like Rd.	O
Going in.	O
Ooh, I like this is for is creating kind of like this like.	O
Strange.	O
Growth texture.	O
Wonder if there's some black going through the middle of us?	O
Like it through here, if I could blend it in if that would look good, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder.	O
So can we integrate these all these areas in believable ways?	O
In I like these things going through.	O
This is cool.	CHITCHAT
Wait a little more hollow there.	O
Imagine a Asian.	O
Like us But As with all things with his to do with his exercise, but I think I got to move on because this is.	O
I feel like I could finish this at a later time.	O

As we have seen.	O
Those behind.	O
Here this white.	O
Bring some's weight in this world aside all the way across.	O
To rate.	O
Back here, it kind of creates this movement like that.	O
Without kind of getting too much in the way human, I'll let the human mind connected those dots.	O
And I won't worry overmuch about what they're doing.	O
But I know that that feeling of movement is going to persistent and build the space.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
That's working out pretty well, let me.	O
There we go.	O
And I got this color here a little bit of that other on top, so right here.	O

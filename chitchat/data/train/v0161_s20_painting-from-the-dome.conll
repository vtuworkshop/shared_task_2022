Cool, now let's start playing with it.	O
Let's make things up.	O
So I love.	O
I like, I mean, obviously this blue is the power is the power color right?	O
So what we need to do is you need to keep that too.	O
Power must be conserved.	O
How to reduce its amount in general?	O
What's the general default color?	O
This is it down the fall color.	O
OK, so I'm going to go ahead and do a lot of that color across a piece.	O
Maybe has interesting.	O
I was wondering if I could do like exterior of Blue.	O
They have a speed kind of.	O
It's like floating whoops, it's like loading rock thing.	O
In the middle.	O

Will experiment.	O
Get the more this green green.	O
Mean.	O
Is kind of the bright greens when the green skip writer that turn into that?	O
Alright, I'm going to try to be a little softer this time.	O
So I'm going to go ahead and start using softer brush strokes.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I'll just.	O
Dislocate a little bit of that blue just so it kind of is deluded a little bit and spread over a certain area.	O
I'm trying to think of what's a good.	O
Like what is what?	O
Some good movement that space?	O
They have seen us in general, swirling.	O
Maybe I want they want that.	O
Except this.	O
To go into deep.	O
Babies kind of mountainous areas.	O
Green and then it's like, no.	O
No highlights ever highlight there.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this would be a cool like top down like a topa graphical jam.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
We could even remove a lot of this.	O
We can tone down a lot of this turquoise as long as we keep a little bit of it there.	O
We can.	CHITCHAT
We can then we can work magic with it, you know.	O
Yeah, that's nice.	O
Oh, this is kind of oh, that's a nice color nice.	O
Although I gotta, I gotta tell you, it kind of.	O
It's a nice enriching color.	O
It might not be a good color to proliferate everywhere.	O
It doesn't seem to be doing.	O
Will be servicing my.	O
My piece that well.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
But we'll go wait over here to get rid of that.	O
Or, you know, I'll just.	O

And maybe what if we had what it maybe would have more of this.	O
Edward And then we kind of had this kind of be this kind of almost like watery shine on the edge of things, then were really capitalizing the idea that this is water.	O
And if this is land that we were looking at.	O
And we're looking at land.	O
How does that tablet topographically workout so?	O
This is kind of exciting actually is if we look at this as a challenge of trying to visualize the 3D landscape.	O
Inventing from our mind, but using these colors they have sampled.	O
We can actually start kind of coming up with like some really cool.	O
Topa graphical like kind of anomaly, not anomaly.	O
Like typographical interest.	O
And we can start generating a 3D space, so I'm going to say that the lighting is coming from the top left down, so we have different settlements in this in the ground and be variations and how things.	O
Shade, etc.	O
But so not everything will be shaded the same way.	O
But in general, if we can get the light.	O
To hit on some of these.	O
Thighs not on the others.	O
And maybe we can create the feeling.	O
But this is a 3D space.	O
This is a 3D environment, so I'm creating these kinds of like legs of land.	O
And also pair with kind of the edge.	O
Edge of.	O
So basically if I go in here and I shade one side in darkness.	O
And I like the other.	O
Using this kind of.	O
Earth stone light.	O
Then we can kind of create some really cool.	O
Semi believable landscapes.	O
Not committed yet, but I like the idea.	O
Also, I'm just down with anything swirling.	O
You know, I mean.	O
Atlas, which is, you know what that's rotate this.	O
I do this fam.	O
Alright, so now the light is coming from.	O
The bottom so different different angle.	O
So let's.	O
To shade on the right side of things.	O
Like this?	O
Why you coming through there we go.	O
There we go.	O
Some kind of activity happening on my blower.	O
That's cool.	O
People getting out.	O
That's nice.	O
Then Hum.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Dumb bum bum bum.	CHITCHAT
I'm done.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Bum bum bum bum bum bum.	CHITCHAT
You can see here I'm using some particular colors to punch outs.	O
Areas of land.	O
It weighs.	O
And hopefully kind of highlight.	O
The three dimensionality ahead.	O
That's the hope anyway.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Though as we go higher into these foothills, we might get bit more light hitting them like this.	O
Greenery etc.	O
Green action.	O
And then we'll get some shadows.	O
We might.	CHITCHAT
We think here how is it?	O
How are these?	CHITCHAT
Charlie, go.	O
But I like this movement overall.	O
You know you don't have been really wanting to.	O
Do you guys let me really wanted to work on a map of my fantasy world and really just like?	O
And like.	O
And do all the little like bays and inlets and all that, and I think just doing that would be a great exercise in world building.	O
Um an ingrate exercise in.	O

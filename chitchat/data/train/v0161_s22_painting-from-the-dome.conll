Kind of like knowing.	O
Like what looks good like what like.	O
Like and like what would be where you know, like when you think about the world through like a kind of a, you know a fictional world for the kind of a geopolitical power struggle.	O
Top down strategy game and started looking at Maps and stuff like that.	O
And you realize, oh, there's also things like tactics and like being tactical.	O
When it comes to geopolitical power, etc.	O
And there's ways that you can do that.	O
As a layman, you can look at a map and be like, oh, I understand if that's there and that's there, then this must be incredibly important.	O
And then you realize, oh, I see.	O
If the country did all it could to hang on to that bit of land, it might be worth their time.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then you can build stories around that.	O
I'm making sense, hope I'm making sense.	O
Just mean I just need to say that you know.	O
At lands.	O
History and politics and all that you know that we've seen in our world, makes for a great study in trying to invent new world, you know.	O
Learn if an enormous amount.	O
Just by studying map.	O
And so I feel like I can invent a lot of things about my world.	O
Right at the cusp, i'ma i'ma fantasy creator for anyone who is curious.	O
By the way I write write fantasy, I have been working in the fantasy realm for my attack.	O
We are.	O
And yeah, so it's kind of my bread and butter.	O
So I can invent things off the hip, you know, just shooting from the hip.	O
Oh, these people have gills on their faces, you know.	O
As terrible example, more messages more magine that generally.	O
But if you can look at, you know if you can look at history or evolution or whatever through a particular lens an explore your world with no preconceptions that direction.	O
Well, then you can kind of create.	O
Beings And nobody's thought of.	O
But suddenly it seems totally believable because.	O
You didn't just make it up.	O
You use their minds to invent.	O
And when when there's an internal consistency in the world that is respected.	O
It goes a really long way in the world of, you know in in world building if you can make somebody believe something about the world.	O
Oh, this is this way oh so of course it makes sense that that would be that way.	O
Well, now you've captured believability you can sell.	O
As a as a fantasy writer or whatever, you can sell a lot of ridiculous things.	O
Premises To an audience, if you can sell that first premise, you know.	O
If I can make you believe that X is true.	O
Then all other wise ease and WS.	O
Kids fall into place.	O
But first you have to believe that access true.	O
That's one of the most complicated parts, I think.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But But I.	O
I'm always up for the task.	O
Or they're not incapable of tasks with another issue, but I'm always up for it.	O
Alright, is kind of a bit of a Canyon.	O
Anything going on here?	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Just that also this is going to be a little brighter up here.	O
And that's the mountain range that we have.	O
This kind of sudden fall off over here.	O
I'll make that not quite so dark.	O
There we go as some greenery.	O
Wendy's mountain peaks, as some topography love.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
And I can create borders that actually.	O
You know, some watery borders that seemed to.	O
But rest the idea of.	O
This thing is a 3D form.	O
There we go.	O
I would've been.	O
Mr Phineas Hello Sir.	CHITCHAT
We were just talking about world building.	CHITCHAT
Something that I know you're pretty pretty interested in.	CHITCHAT
Then it's it's.	CHITCHAT
It's not like Twitch over here, it's much quieter.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Just you and me buddy.	CHITCHAT

It's very romantic.	CHITCHAT
It.	CHITCHAT
Now we can still hang out next month.	CHITCHAT
It's like up view of a Lake.	CHITCHAT
Yes, exactly exactly.	CHITCHAT
It looks.	CHITCHAT
It does look like a like that, doesn't it?	O
That's cool, it's coming.	O
It's coming together excellence.	O
Now I'm kind of started to add a little.	O
You know cracks and fissures in the.	O
In the earth, and that's doing a lot, I think to sell.	O
Three dimensionality of it.	O
Let me continue to make that happen across here.	O
I'm going to make this a little bit dimmer over here.	O
Probably this would not be so dark, I feel like.	O
Being lower down, it might be a more illuminated altogether for it.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Here I will rotate this back.	O
Rotate 180 bam.	O
Cool, so this is actually coming together.	O
It's actually it looks like a top down view.	O
Now let's remind ourselves this came from this image.	O
So kind of it was a top down view.	O
We're doing something very different this time.	O
Here we go.	O
Wonderful.	CHITCHAT
So again, if we have light coming from one side, let's continue to emphasize what side is what.	O
Well, add the shadow in here a bit.	O
I will blend this in here, this is.	O
These two bodies of land are she joined.	O
If you will have some kind of joint over here.	O
Scared is blue in here where it's not.	O
And then we can actually add in.	O
Maybe like a little like Lake in here, like a little.	O
Body of water edge.	O
And then we'll add some shadow on the one side, because it's whatever the land has to kind of collapse down into that.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Bum bum bum bum.	CHITCHAT
Very studious feeling in the room there.	O
Bum bum bum bum.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Right, we create a bit more of this world.	O
Yeah, but it could've shoreline glitter.	O
A little bit it actually it makes sense that there would be it just a little bit of color blending I think.	O
Like along some of the edges where, like the kind of edge of Earth goes into.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
See, that's very odd.	O
With all that you got the app and you still aren't able to.	O
Neither just working out the bugs.	O
Thanks for coming.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, good to have you.	CHITCHAT
As always my friend.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some shadows on this side of the mountain.	O
It would not be as much and then maybe on this side the peak goes up.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And I'm learning about how to Draw Something from the Sky.	O
Right now this is cool.	O
I'm not like I didn't know how to do this before and.	O
Now I'm learning.	O
You're just kind of how to you know what works?	O
What doesn't you know, like what wut lines really give certain feelings?	O
What doesn't?	CHITCHAT
I almost never do landscapes 'cause they're very intimidating to me and.	O
I just haven't taken the time to like really figure out.	O
And so this is excellent.	O
Actors for me.	O
Thank you all for being here.	O
Whilst I practice this landscape thing, I'm glad that I hope that it continues to be entertaining.	O
Informative everyone here.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I'm having a great time having a grand old time.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll add some more light on this coast.	O

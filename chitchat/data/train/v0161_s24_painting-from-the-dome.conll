We definitely trying to create like a certain like.	O
Should I create one last little island right in here?	O
I think so because it creates the swirling feeling there are going for.	O
We can add a little bit of turquoise around the exterior.	O
Keep going into the water.	O
At the Alex believable.	O
Basically what I'm doing is I'm blending.	O
Local land and bring into the water and then bring the watercolor and putting it gently over and then giving it just the Faintest will shoreline.	O
Outline you know?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping that creates a feeling of like death.	O
Play some mountain continues down under the surface.	O
But we have this very faint.	O
And ripple away.	O
The surface would be.	O
And then that makes me also want to go in here.	O
Just reduce a little bit more that turquoise.	O
Where there's kind of nothing much happening and then use it, but there's a lot happening.	O
I can create general movement in the water.	O
While I'll create this kind of like pushing.	O
Pushing feeling.	O
Now, like ripples.	O
Moving out.	O
And I think that like creating this this feeling.	O
Movement.	O
I think we're creating a certain kind of action.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I will draw more down into the walks into the water with his pen here.	O
Then I'll just again just highlight some of the shore did have to be all of it.	O
It shouldn't be all the way here.	O
But just a little bit of outline there.	O
It help.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And then I'll leave it out.	O
When these values in colors.	O
Little bit more balance.	O
Again, I like this pale.	O
No, like I don't over do it, but it's very nice.	O
Got that.	O
Turquoise.	O
We go.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'd be able to shoreline lighting.	O
But here.	CHITCHAT
This comes along the shore up the mountains.	O
I like this.	CHITCHAT
Big here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we used some of this black on this side.	O
This is black over here.	O
Is that black or is that what is that?	O
Look by black.	O
And will draw some shadows.	O
Oh man, layers in Photoshop Fannar.	O
Blessing at that.	O
I'm using them here to be honest, if you go, but in general.	O
Layers are very helpful.	O
There's a very helpful.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Area.	CHITCHAT
Me flip it on the X Axis, Bing.	O
All right now I have a good sense of.	O
By the landscape of the lighting is.	O
A lot and I like this muted.	O
Look, we have here of the light of level land.	O
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
OK so I have a land.	O
Is a water define digital and that the land 'cause like this out?	O
And then if it curves around, is this like?	O
Low of water around the outskirts.	O
Bring it back out here.	CHITCHAT
Bring it back out here.	O
This darkness will be on this side.	O
Move it.	O
Remember it in this in this particular instance we have very dramatic.	O

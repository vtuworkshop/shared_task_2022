Kind of lighting sunlight coming from one end.	O
But this illustration.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'll have some of his lights.	O
Down the coast, I mean down the.	O
Tide up here.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Makes my head dollar.	O
That Then yeah and then.	O
There are some like that.	O
Hear more shadow.	O
There we go.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Area.	O
I like this dark green dominate use that I'll bring in the light green a little bit here.	O
It's a nice foil or out for a nice counterbalance.	O
This turquoise, it's close enough, it's bright enough.	O
Yeah, like that effect that gives.	O
All right, there we go.	O
I'll do a little bit of shadow under the surface of the water of the land itself.	O
I'll replicate that.	O
Extrapolate that out.	O
And then I'll just go in again and just highlight a little bit of the edge.	O
I'll cut in there.	O
Yeah, that's nice.	O
And then I'll.	O
Very few more of these cracks, right?	O
I worked so well for me elsewhere.	O
And a lot of them are.	O
None of this cracks end up being kind of like.	O
Boarding too.	O
Run off the kind of thing you know as millenia pass and rock.	O
Kind of starts crumbling.	O
Here this would be.	O
This would be generally pretty lights.	O
Maybe this would be?	O
It is flatter.	O
Over here a little Mesa.	O
In create some kind of.	O
This is where it climbs up.	O
On the other becomes a meter, will kind of shade them into little bit.	O
Ann That's good.	O
And some cracks without landscape.	O
Yeah.	O
That's nice.	O
I wish her well like that.	O
I'm TomTom bum bum bum.	O
What happens if I just grab this?	O
Turquoise and push it around.	O
I forgot I was going to get create some movement OK alright so I will continue to create a uses dark color and all of her to push and create movement.	O
And there we go and then use the bright color and do the exact same thing.	O
Just have them work in tandem, you know.	O
And then in general it will spill out.	O
On this inlet is lit.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Cool cool OK that's cool cool.	CHITCHAT
It does create this blowing out feel and we have these individual.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Movements, and then when they're kind of joined together at the center as we hit the.	O
Edge of whatever this piece of land is.	O
They.	O
And the flow outward and join forces into this big spill.	O
Of lights of water.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
Then bring in the darkness there.	O
Fisher, even deeper darkness we could use.	O
Too dark, but it's nice to have that colour variation in there.	O
Hello everybody joining good to see you good to have you.	CHITCHAT
We're having fun today.	CHITCHAT
Inventing, creating.	CHITCHAT
It's a pleasure to have you all with me.	CHITCHAT

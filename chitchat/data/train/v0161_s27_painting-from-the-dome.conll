Alright, I'm going to move on.	CHITCHAT
Because while I enjoy doing this, I need to keep it fresh.	O
This is the image we started with this image here.	O
Let's make these bigger.	O
Let's make these reference images bigger.	O
I think I should.	O
I should do another one.	O
I think I should do another one.	O
Here's.	O
Is another one I did.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just make a little bit bigger than that.	O
And then there's this one.	O
I would like the dots on the shoreline.	O
It seems like the sun setting there.	O
Oh like, what do you mean which starts the blue dots?	O
Or you mean these are these new on the shoreline?	O
You mean the yeah, yeah, do you mean blue?	O
Dumb dumb.	CHITCHAT
Bum bum bum bum bum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but I'm bum bum bum.	CHITCHAT
Bah, Bah.	CHITCHAT
Bah Bah Bah Bum Bum.	CHITCHAT
Bump, Bump, Bump, Bump, Bump Bump excellent.	CHITCHAT
Well, thank you Alexander.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you did that.	CHITCHAT
Blue ones, yeah, the blue dots.	O
Yeah, kind of case that little shimmer.	O
You know that water is shimmer.	O
They always see that right?	O
When you look at the shoreline you always see like.	O
The glitter of water.	O
Touching the light water reflects the light so beautiful you know.	O
When it did, it download it on the Internet.	O
There I'm gonna.	O
This crab, this let's grab a pure blue again from the photo.	O
An really just kind of fly it.	O
Make sure it didn't get diluted in the process.	O
As more this glitter.	O
Like Alexander's talking about.	O
Have fun with it.	O
Make sure it's.	O
You know it's it's getting some play and we can pretend like you know there's in areas where it's especially rocky.	O
We can have some really nice.	O
Like almost trailing.	O
Letter works, you know, 'cause you know that there's a lot of like turbulence in the waters kicking up a little bit, or it's literally glittering around rocks.	O
Litter Splitter glittering.	O
That's what I said.	O
That's it.	O
Yeah, creating nice.	O
And it's hard shine litter.	O
Act Definitely helping our.	O
Light is coming from the side.	O
Bing.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I do like criminal sense of movement as well.	O
It does pleases me.	O
So actually if I create these shapes.	O
And really looking Fillans well.	O
With the different areas, definitely do a lot to like a feeling of movement.	O
It like just this flow of water in a direction and over here in large arrays it might be a little flatter, a bit more calm like this.	O
Right with the waves kind of hit each other and kind of even out into general rocking.	O
Light.	O
But There we go again.	O
Wherever there is drama.	O
We have the water kicking out of it.	O
This is great.	O
I've learned a lot about how to paints, water and landscape etc.	O
Justin doing this one little image.	O
This is great.	O
All right, Alexander Finn.	O
You have a cool picture of landscape that's really cool, like lighting scheme that you guys think I should make into a painting.	O
I've done this one.	O
Which is real trippy.	O
Now I'm looking at it again.	O
Super trippy.	O
This is my first one.	O
Ones like this are kind of the easiest.	O
'cause they like such a dramatic color scheme.	O
And this is the first one I did actually never got very far with this.	O
This is just a.	O
I'd like to be like applied paint of it though.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I didn't end up doing that much with it, but I just dig.	O
Just take the little that I did.	O
I wonder what would happen if I just.	O

Well, that's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Um, in the best results overall.	CHITCHAT
That's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's try this one.	O
Let's try this one and let's create something different, alright?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
To static, who's obviously whose name I just messed up.	O
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
My bad.	CHITCHAT
Let's, uh.	CHITCHAT
Start with this.	O
And let's see what we can build and let's build something unusual.	O
This time it won't think about it to deeply right off the bat, but let's just do it all, right?	O
So there's.	O
Dragons is projected pulling these colors in.	O
And we got this dark dark Gray Sky does even with that real.	O
I don't know if it's real or not lighter.	O
Latest and then pale pale white.	O
That's that's pretty much white.	O
That's interesting, alright?	O
Yeah, let's do it.	O
Let's do it good.	O
Good suggestion.	O
And right now I'm just kind of color sampling.	O
I'm kind of just trying to get a nice.	O
Uh, hey Sheridan.	CHITCHAT

Where do you know me from Sheridan?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT

Hi Hello Hello.	CHITCHAT
OK great, we have this kind of what's the color of the mountain side dark?	O
Dark.	O
A.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Those kind of our our colors.	O
Let's move this off to the side a little bit.	O
There are colors.	O
So now let me flip things around a little bit.	O
I'm gonna grab this color here.	O
And I'm going to apply to the underside here in dive cetera.	O
We're going to make this.	O
What should?	CHITCHAT
What kind of looks like?	O
A like a landscape kind of thing?	O
It's like a more of an undercut.	O
Kind of hanging thing and will add this earth stuff up here.	O
What I think I want to do is I think I want to make some kind of face or something like that.	O
Using these colors, 'cause the unusual mix?	O
And I think it could be really cool if we do something kind of unusual unexpected.	O

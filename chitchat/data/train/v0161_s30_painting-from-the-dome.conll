So this is these are the colors we have.	O
I think we maybe we're using this whites too strongly.	O
Let me punch that back.	O
Much that back.	O
I had the mouth open.	O
I'm going to close the mouth.	O
Maybe you know if we if we basically.	O
But using the colors and values of this thing.	O
But let's see what the scribe this Sky color and then put it underneath.	O
Space kind of thing we have going on so it kind of floats a bit more.	O
I don't know if I like this.	O
I mean I might just mess it up honestly.	O
Like not, not by mistake, I'm being purposefully.	O
I don't know if I like it enough to like face ID enough.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But we could also start with a face.	O
And then make it into something else.	O
So maybe that would be a fun exercise.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Thanks Phil.	CHITCHAT
I'll maybe I'll use that one next time I next time I do a painting.	O
I can't access it now.	O
With ease.	O
But that's a great that might be a great place to start next time.	O
Sorry, I thought you could post right here on the stream, but I was wrong.	O
Apparently.	O
She gets make sense.	O
They don't want people spamming people.	O
You know that kind of thing.	O
Yeah, I was on twist the other day working on a 3D model.	O
Sheraton I thought you'd be interested.	O
Interested to hear it's a model of a face.	O
I'll be by sign off from here.	O
I'll be going onto that.	O
And and basically.	O
It's a It's a model.	O
The faces Porsche with all the muscles and all that.	O
So people here are watching and they want to see that come find me on Twitch and you will see some really fun.	O
Bony, Bony protrusions muscular protuberances.	O
Other strange words like that.	O
Um, I'm learning a lot about human anatomy.	O
Which is saying alot 'cause actually no fair amount just because I'm a character doesn't have been cared artist for so many years.	O
But when it comes to the specific muscles of the face etc I've.	O
Don't know as much as I thought I did, or I maybe I knew.	O
I know that I never knew but.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But it's fascinating regardless.	O
Excellent thanks share.	O
Sheridan Yeah today were I'll show you were doing since some people just walked in here.	O
We're using photo references to use like this photo reference.	O
Great, this piece of Art.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
This photo reference.	O
Create this piece of Arts.	O
This is a photo evidence.	O
To create this piece art.	O
And most recently we used.	O
This photo Create this.	O
And so we're going to do this one more again, I don't know what it's going to be.	O
I mean, it looks a lot like a face at the moment.	O
But I don't know that I want to do that because I often I feel like that that's kind of goes against my.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Can we go get a little bit against my like?	O
Aim today, which was.	O
Oh, thanks Sheridan.	CHITCHAT
Do you know the Czech Republic?	CHITCHAT
Yes, of course.	CHITCHAT
Of course, I never.	CHITCHAT
I've never been there.	CHITCHAT
And I know it and I know.	CHITCHAT
I have a few friends who were from the Czech Republic.	CHITCHAT
I really want to go one day.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, So what I'm saying is I want to make this face, but I don't want to make something that will.	O
If I get it wrong will look wrong.	O
I don't want that, but in fact I'm actually kind of right now.	O
I'm kind of doing things.	O
I'm going to make a bunch of marks that are not that don't necessarily make sense with the design of a face, because I don't want to totally be dragging that direction.	O
And yet I did myself.	O
Part of me feels like I could feel myself doing it doing that, like letting myself be drawn in that direction.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So it's so much of this project today, is it about improvising?	O

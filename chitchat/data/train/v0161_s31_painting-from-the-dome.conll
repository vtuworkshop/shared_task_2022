So maybe I've.	O
I've gone too far with it, but you know what I can.	O
I can kind of like just invent and we can kind of just.	O
We can build something unique.	O
It doesn't.	O
You know it already looks like something that's like not quite.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Its every night human or composed of human like elements, flesh and blood etc.	O
Maybe we could just capitalize on that to make it extra weird and really take advantage of that.	O
Let's see here.	O
What are the input areas of interest?	O
Victory Christian tributaries that down the length of the face.	O
Is he just lines?	CHITCHAT
It disrupts things that like to connect things.	O
They can kind of create some of those.	O
Then I can kind of indicates me some more mayhem to work with.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
So it might be a little bit strong, but actually there's an element of the white that works for me because it actually creates this kind of.	O
Impactful splatter of action.	O
That's interesting, I can.	O
I can I can take some of that that line and turn it into a kind of a specular highlight.	O
Some of that can be something else, some other effects.	O
We go.	O
Alright, we create some more cracks etc.	O
That's those are the wrong kinds that found on color.	O
I want something darker.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's rotate this image.	O
Interesting.	CHITCHAT
Interesting.	O
Extend these eyes out and then actually I can create a crack.	O
I create one of these cracks.	O
It down the middle.	O
That'll really throw some chaos in there.	O
And then we can add some shadows or imply that shadows if you will.	O
As far side.	O
Asthma brightness.	O
There.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And I create, you know, I could even one more crack.	O
And the side.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
All right, and then I'm going to create some.	O
Let me continue to work on my mass is building out so many colors and then I want to add some texture, something maybe some bubbliness, some mossy.	O
Kind of texture to kind of counteract and a craggy element of it, and maybe make him look like he's really.	O
The Hues of rock man, you know.	O
Some kind.	O
And create, yeah.	O
I like some of this weight, maybe balancing out against the bottom here.	O
Mostly it's a yellowish white, sure.	O
Every up.	O
Hey, can you see the face?	O
Does it make sense?	CHITCHAT
I'm looking forward to the fallout show.	O
Yeah, the show movie, whatever it is, I'm into it.	O
I'm like you know, do I think it would be good?	O

I have no idea.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea, but I gotta tell you the source material there.	CHITCHAT
Working from is pretty great.	CHITCHAT
Excited and pumped.	CHITCHAT
I hope they like you some of my mantra designs, you know.	CHITCHAT
That would be dope.	CHITCHAT
That would be really cool.	CHITCHAT
I mean it would.	CHITCHAT
It would also not be cool 'cause you know not getting paid anything.	CHITCHAT
But even if I work there, I wouldn't be getting paid anything that you know 'cause it belongs to them, right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm excited.	CHITCHAT
But a cool idea.	CHITCHAT
For show I've been wanting.	CHITCHAT
Fallout show.	CHITCHAT
Or fallout movie rather.	CHITCHAT
Like forever.	CHITCHAT
Universe is just begging for it, you know?	CHITCHAT
Like that not our universe, I mean like the fallout universe.	CHITCHAT
Is begging for some kind of?	CHITCHAT
You know that the world has so much potential, I feel.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I've had this made by the simple for me Westworld.	CHITCHAT
That's true that I might actually be really good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, maybe I have mixed feelings about Westworld, but I do feel that they know fun.	CHITCHAT
And so I think that's the key here, you know.	CHITCHAT
Is will it be fun?	CHITCHAT
And that's cool.	CHITCHAT
That's imaginative and.	CHITCHAT
It's also funny because.	CHITCHAT
Westworld is so much about like kind of games.	CHITCHAT
In the world of Westworld, like the world that like existed that everyone used to go in and.	CHITCHAT
Play Cowboys and Indians.	CHITCHAT
It.	CHITCHAT
It's like it's like A.	CHITCHAT
It's like an open world game, basically right.	CHITCHAT
Kind of what it is.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Alexander graduate despite details.	CHITCHAT
They do kind of add a little something something.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you think so.	CHITCHAT
You know, part of me is quite jealous that they're making this show, and I'm not involved.	CHITCHAT
But on their hand, there was never any.	CHITCHAT
There was never really going to be any circumstance where I would be involved if I were to Bethesda, I still wouldn't be involved because they did not.	CHITCHAT
It's not really how they worked, you know?	CHITCHAT
There are quite a corporate structure to be honest with you.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'll give it an assignment under eyelid.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And so yeah, they wouldn't.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't really be a part of this project anyway.	CHITCHAT
But I'll just be psyched if they like you know if we see death claw on the show or something and it looks like just like my desk while you know.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
All right?	O
Cool cool cool cool I like this this this kind of turned out and have fun.	O
Now I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to create some kind of texture.	O
To the faithful little bit you know will continue to refine.	O
The face itself.	O
But I definitely want to create some feeling of like.	O
Like growth or something.	O
So Adam start adding in these kinds of.	O
Let me start trying to raise some.	O
Elvis.	O
Like what would it look like if if this was kind of like looked like greenery or something you know like Moss?	O
I don't think you can create a fallout universe in.	O
China.	O
Because it kind of flies in the face of.	O
So much of the role of fallout, which was all about.	O
It's the 1950s vibe in America.	O
It's the everyone can own a house, have a backyard, have a dog.	O

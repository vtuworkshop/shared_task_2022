If their noses into where they shouldn't be, you know.	O
And make decisions.	O
Oh Goshen Shell.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, great franchise.	CHITCHAT
We should have Scarlett Johansson play that character.	CHITCHAT
Skylander attached to the bad job.	CHITCHAT
You just like why?	CHITCHAT
Why are why?	CHITCHAT
You could pick anybody.	CHITCHAT
You can, there's literally thousands of actors actresses.	CHITCHAT
But what are you gonna do?	CHITCHAT
That's Hollywood, baby.	CHITCHAT
That's why, and This is why.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
You have companies like.	CHITCHAT
A HBO just crushing it out there.	CHITCHAT
Is it like, you know we're going to go ahead and make good things with good stories?	CHITCHAT
We're not going to use all like the most amazing actors we're going to use.	CHITCHAT
You never heard of.	CHITCHAT
And it's like, oh, that's why everyone watches that stuff now.	CHITCHAT
Also, kids movie theaters are crazy expensive.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going in here and I am.	O
I am using this blur tool.	O
Blur's messages, 'cause actually?	O
What's one thing I really want to work on in general in life as an artist is blurring edges.	O
Of losing some edges.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Because I think I like that, like you know, not doing hard edged everything.	O
I think is enormously important.	O
As an artist, the remember.	O
Edges themselves are.	O
It catch the eye.	O
Actually it goes himself.	CHITCHAT
Movies are pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
They feel like they went with different style.	CHITCHAT
Now you see movies which ones?	CHITCHAT
Which ones do you mean like the one from like 1990 something?	CHITCHAT
I went, I saw that in theaters.	CHITCHAT
I was really excited when that came out.	CHITCHAT
I went with my friend Andrew.	CHITCHAT
My mom took us.	CHITCHAT
And it was pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
The head.	CHITCHAT
They have the graphic novel at that point I think I did.	CHITCHAT
I can't remember.	CHITCHAT
I got the graphic novel once around 15 or something like that.	CHITCHAT
I can't remember.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I just read about it.	CHITCHAT
This ghost in the shell.	CHITCHAT
Movie.	CHITCHAT
And it was an amazing to be released in theaters, and it was supposed to blow the lid off everything.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's what happened.	CHITCHAT
Dial blur I'm so old.	O
There we go.	O
This has become a kind of character, right?	O
He's he's got some.	O
He's got stories to tell.	O
Definitely not natural.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
For this app.	O
And if this white stuff is like snow or something like that.	O
We can use it to kind of create.	O
I can maybe I can outline the eye with a little bit more.	O
And we can go over the eye socket appear.	O
And a cool.	O
As a certain kind of aids, a certain kind of like a certain feel.	O
That, I think is kind of cool.	O
I've only seen the first one too.	O
I don't think I've watched another ghost in the shell.	CHITCHAT
I watched the live stream the live action one.	CHITCHAT
And I was not.	CHITCHAT
At first there was there was a couple part was like oh this is dope.	CHITCHAT
And then it kind of keep going off the wrong direction.	CHITCHAT
And it's just not just not where it needs to be.	CHITCHAT
Characters were not that like memorable.	CHITCHAT
The seat.	CHITCHAT
They kind of forgot, like some essential things, which is likely.	CHITCHAT
Why do we care about this movie or like basis?	CHITCHAT
You know, are we having fun?	CHITCHAT
But I'm also a movie snap, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Anybody else out there?	CHITCHAT
Is a movie star, but I'ma.	CHITCHAT
Definitely, I'm a picky, picky fella.	CHITCHAT
I'm definitely people who like everyone's like that was great and I'm kind of like Yeah was it though, was it?	CHITCHAT

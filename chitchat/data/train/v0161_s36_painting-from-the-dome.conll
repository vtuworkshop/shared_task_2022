Knowing what you know about the hotel and seeing the characters walk into the hotel around some corners and into this room, there should not be a light there.	CHITCHAT
There should not be a window there and out of that window.	CHITCHAT
Is coming this very intense, very intensive whites?	CHITCHAT
English light.	CHITCHAT
And it's it registers is daylight, just something?	CHITCHAT
Off about it all.	CHITCHAT
That's exactly the kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
That like.	CHITCHAT
Dude, this to put in the movies and you wouldn't notice until you watching anytime.	CHITCHAT
So every time I watch the shining I get something new out of it.	CHITCHAT
The feel like wow is loaded with Easter eggs, you know?	CHITCHAT
Studio Ghibli is.	CHITCHAT
They're stand out.	CHITCHAT
They are unlike them in their tremendous.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Lot of fun overall groups that I just know I'm OK.	CHITCHAT
They just.	CHITCHAT
Maybe is undone.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm shaving.	O
I got it bro cat.	O
Yeah I think so, OK?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so fun now why isn't?	O
Be here.	O
Make sure that my chat is upper.	O
Looks like from what I was looking at that it wasn't.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, give Lee is unparalleled.	CHITCHAT
There is nothing quite like them.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to take a this green here and even though the photo reference only goes to a certain point, I'm going to just bring it up a little farther.	O
This little yellow.	O
Just so that we have a little bit of.	O
And persistent, I'm going to pop that in there.	O
This creates a little more interest, that's all.	O
It's just fun.	O
I can create maybe some deep cracks throughout.	O
Deeper than before here.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Ann It gives.	O
I mean there's nothing quite like Ghibli, honestly.	O
They just know women that Winsey and their artistic direction is just.	O
Oh Mr.	O
Sun parallels.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, that's pretty cool like that, but this is turned out pretty well.	O
We create let me grab this little extra bright.	O
Extra yellow popping up stupid Moran.	O
Just add a bit more.	O
The upward growth on some of these areas.	O
Mr really drive home that like you know there's something.	O
And a plant life, some kind of Moss.	O
Whatever it is.	O
Growing up I don't know if it's really reading like that, but it's worth a shot so.	O
What's your favorite Ghibli movie that's a good one?	O
Maybe Nasaka Valley of the wind maybe?	O
I like spirited away a lot.	O
I really like.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I've got no name.	O
Great design, no name.	O
I liked I really.	O
There's a lot I liked about.	O
What's it called?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Come on.	O
Princess Mononoke.	O
There's a lot of like Princess Mononoke.	O
I just never really felt like the movie totally came together for me and that is.	O
I imagine that will probably that feeling will go away when I watch it again, because that is not necessarily like an especially valid opinion for me to have.	O
I recognize what I'm saying is I recognize I'm wrong.	O
About that like you know, I'm willing to admit that, like.	O
Yeah, I think you know anything.	O
Part of it was I was expecting one thing or expected something to happen.	O
Maybe I expected it to follow.	O
Some western storyline structures, and it didn't.	O
And it became a little bit difficult.	O
You know, that's my only thing about is about that, um, about giving movies that always kind of tripped me up is I always feel like I, I can see where they're going.	O
And then they don't go in that direction and I find it a little unsatisfying.	O
But I honestly believe that's just that's just I am culturally expecting something.	O

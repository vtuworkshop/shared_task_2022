It's going to be fun.	CHITCHAT
Very excited, so as always, be sure to download the design assets along with this live stream and you can find it on.	O
Be hand somewhere in the be hands area.	O
I don't know.	O
I think it's I think there's like a link on the right below the chat or something like that, but be sure to download it.	O
The design template.	O
And yeah, so this is just an example of a mask.	O
It's kind of.	O
It's really big.	O
It's not going to be this big, but I mean I have some really boring face Mass.	O
I don't know about you guys.	O
I have this.	O
Screen face Messi have a black set of black face mask.	O
And I'm going to be going out later today and I'm going to have to wear face masks.	O
and I hate I don't like it, but I have to do it.	O
I know it's we have to stay safely and to make sure that we don't get this nasty bug.	O
So I'm just going to design some face masks in design the face mask.	O
I wish I had and hopefully there's a site out there where you can design your own face mask.	O
I'm sure there is, but yeah, definitely probably going to do that soon.	O
'cause I am six of these face masks, right?	O
So now I'm going to transition.	O
To my browser because essentially I just want to show you guys basically what we're going to do today.	O
So we're actually going to utilize some really very very nicely designed UI kits to design our website.	O
So as you can see, scrolling down and if you go to adobe.com or just Google, Adobe X DUI kids, you'll find this site and there's so many UI kits you can choose from.	O
There is a component things do I.	O
You like it by Howard Pinsky.	O
Um, there's a design system UI kit.	O
There's this hand drawn wireframe UI kit I love.	O
This is, oddly enough, I think my favorite you like it because you can rapidly prototype.	O
You know whatever you're working on, and I actually use this recently for a client, so I I really love this hand drawn wireframe UI kit.	O
Yeah, so, but for today's live stream we're actually going to be using this XT wire frame kit.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And we're just going to build out our product page site using this like it.	O
So if you download today's design template, I did include this like a few.	O
Acid from this template in the design template for streams so you don't have to download it, but if you want, I definitely encourage you to download it and explore the the UI kit.	O
Alright, so how about that out of the way?	O
What I'm gonna do is I'm actually going to just emphasize some info I got for today's live stream, so I actually went on Steve Madden's website because I love to shop in doing some shopping, online shopping, and this is probably.	O
Cook closest design that we're going to do today, so it's just going to be really simple.	O
We're going to have kind of a black navigation menu at the top.	O
It's going to be white, pretty much black and white, and the only real color I guess is going to be from our face mask design, and this is just an example of a single product page for a face mask, so there's you know a nice image of our product or the face mask and then we have some.	O
I guess it's not the photos for this product.	O
We have a nice big add to cart button and some very old.	O
I guess a title or a name for our base math, so we're going to kind of use that as a guide when we are designing today's site.	O
OK, so yeah, this is our site in the first thing we're going to do is let me just show you the face mask template that we will be using today.	O
So in photo shop.	O
Hopefully you guys can see this, but I have six.	O
I guess art boards in photo shop, but we're actually going to create 3 product images for each for our face, so we're going to basically design two face masks and then each base Max will have these three different views, so there's going to be like a front view side and into side views, so I already kind of have a little design that I did.	O
So essentially what I did is I actually.	O
Used it took a photo from Adobe Stock and then I use the liquify tool in Photoshop so we're going to try doing that.	O
And yeah, it's really cool tool to using photo shop and I actually got that from Paul trainees live stream and he did it a couple weeks ago, but he was designing face mask and he used the liquify tool in a photo and it just gives it such a full effect.	O

So that's what we're going to do, so yeah, so I'm going to.	O
Go back to my browser.	O
There we go and we're going to go on Adobe Stock and look this number cato's.	O
So let's see what's on stock.	O
I think I'm going to.	O
Let's see what's frozen.	O
Treats has to offer in terms of photos.	O
Well, we have some pretty colors, so essentially I want to look for a photo with some pretty colors.	O
That way when we liquefy it in Photoshop it's going to really show some nice colors and it's going to.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So I really like this popsicle photo.	O
Let's see what else there is.	O
Well, this is cool.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just gonna.	O
I'm not even going to bother license the photos.	O
So if you don't have an Adobe stock license where you can purchase a photo, you can just download a preview.	O
And that's pretty much sufficient for you know for design.	O
So let's see what else there is.	O
I really like this one.	O
I think I'm going to grab that.	O
So I'm just going to hit download preview or actually, yeah, OK, I'll download the preview.	O
Usually what I do is I do save it to my library, but.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I know I'm going to save it or download the previews today.	O
I think I'm going to look for another photo, let's see.	O
I was going to type into summer 'cause I was just putting me in this summer.	O
Nude Speaking of summer it was so hot on I think it was Wednesday.	O
I went out for a walk and.	O
Yeah, it was sweating in places that you don't want to sweat weather basically.	O
And it was literally the hottest.	O
I didn't even realize it, but we found out it was the hottest day so far of summers, though that was.	O
Yeah, I definitely felt that.	O
And let me know how you guys are doing.	O
I hope you are enjoying summer and.	O
Going out for walks, I know where inside a lot, but you can get some fresh air.	O
Get some vitamin D who I love this photo so I love the pink.	O
I love the blue.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
The yellow we're going to download that and fun fact pink is my favorite color.	O
I love pink.	O
OK so I have some photos I have.	O
Think should I get another one?	O
I don't want to spend too long on picking a photos, but maybe I'll choose one more who I love this one too.	O
OK, I'm going to download that one right.	O
So I have three photos that I can choose from.	O
I'm going to hop back over to.	O
Photo shop.	O
And let's design our face fast.	O
So I'm really hoping that.	O
It's not too lady because I found when I use the liquify tool in photo shop.	O
Uhm, it's really really laggy.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we have our face mask.	O
So what I'm going to do now?	O
And I'm just going to select.	O
This last row, because I already have my first design.	O
I might change it up, we'll see, but.	O
I'm going to select the 2nd row here and right in the right hand side in the layers panel I'm just going to click this.	O
You're designed here and it just FY.	O
I did not create these face mask facemask mockups.	O
I actually got these off of free pic.	O
And they have a ton of free design, you know, resources and acid, so I think I linked it in the description, but it's not I will link where I got these mock ups in the description below the live stream.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to turn this off and I'm going to import the photos that I downloaded from Adobe stock so.	O
Let me search for that in my downloads folder.	O
And I think I'm going to start off with popsicles, were going to name this photo popsicles.	O
So we're going to place it here nicely on our board.	O

And again, we're just downloading.	CHITCHAT
We just downloaded the preview from Adobe stock so we don't have to have Adobe stop license.	O
You don't have to have one, OK, so now I'm actually going to make sure this layer is selected.	O
And OK, I'm just going to go to health and I'm just going to search for liquefy.	O
So it's under filter liquefier.	O
OK, there it is.	CHITCHAT
So just going to click liquefy.	O
And now we're in the liquify tool, so this is my new favorite told photo shop.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to zoom out so I can see it a little better.	O
And I'm just going to start dragging.	O
Clicking around the photo.	O
We can make some swirls.	O
And we can make some a cool little.	O
Would this be considered a pattern?	O
I guess just a design?	O
To seize swirly colors like so.	O
And as you can see, it's already really making this so cool like this.	O
It's turning it is making this photo into a new design, basically.	O
So we're just swirling around, dragging, clicking, clicking.	O
Having fun.	O
And we're just making and you.	O
Image.	O
And this is probably the easiest way to like.	O
Make us a different pattern or a different design like you just grab a photo you like with some nice colors, liquefy it, and then you're literally making an entirely new image.	O
So's wireless wireless wireless.	O
OK, I think I'm happy with this uhm?	O
Yeah, I think this looks good I I'm liking the way this turned out so I'm just going to hit OK.	O
And we just need to wait for it to load.	O
And Speaking of liquify, I know this is actually used for editing photos and making people either slimmer or.	O
Bigger like you can use it to like maybe slim down your face or your body or something.	O
I know people use that magazines, probably that's what that's what they mean when they talk about photoshopping.	O
A photo like that photos photo shop.	O
They're probably using liquefy and like making someone look a certain way.	O
So you can use liquid by for that as well.	O
OK, so we have a massive colors, a sea of colors.	O
So what I'm going to just do now is I'm going to press the command S to save it.	O
And this should appear on our face mask mockups.	O
So let's see how that turned out woo.	O
That looks so cool.	CHITCHAT
That looks so cool.	O
But it looks like it's showing up on that Copass 2, so I guess it's kind of linked.	O
Let's see what's going on.	O
So yeah, so it's linked OK.	O
So I already kind of design that first row so we don't have to really worry about.	O
You know making sure that they are not linked, but when you are designing, your face must be sure to.	O
I guess design them separately.	O
So first to your first design and then the second design.	O
Yeah, so let me just continue adding that.	O
Design to our second and third images.	O
So because I already have this.	O
Designs I think I'm just going to copy this layer.	O
And let's say we link to the file.	O
I'm just trying to see if I can unlink.	O
This like this design.	O
I don't want to spend too much time on that, so yeah, let's just grab this image that is layer.	O
An I'm going to place this design on our second image and then our third image.	O
So I'm just going to double click.	O

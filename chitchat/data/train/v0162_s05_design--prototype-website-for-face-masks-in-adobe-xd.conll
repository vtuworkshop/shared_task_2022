And as you can see for this I used a photo of a beach and I use liquify and any kind of made this school affect.	O
I'm just going to command the pace that layer.	O
And let's wait for that to load as well.	O
I'm so scared to do.	O
I guess working in Photoshop and using the liquid liquify tool 'cause live streaming an using liquefy an all the other programs that I have up.	O
That's like a recipe for crashing.	O
That's a recipe for failure.	CHITCHAT
And Speaking of failures, last weekend I did a live stream in my Mike was off the entire time.	CHITCHAT
And it was over an hour.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that was quite the live stream and I don't know if anyone watched it, but yeah, that was really really.	CHITCHAT
Really interesting, but it's all good.	CHITCHAT
I'm back my Mike's on.	CHITCHAT
Don't give up, that's the that's the moral of the story.	CHITCHAT
Don't give up.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're going to have to wait for this to load taking awhile.	O
Do do today.	O
OK, it's almost done.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
We have oops.	O
What's it loading now?	O
Oh gosh.	CHITCHAT
Rendering come on.	O
So if you are tuning into the live stream, don't be shy.	CHITCHAT
Say hello, I hope you're having a wonderful morning and let me know where you're from where you're joining me.	CHITCHAT
I'm from Toronto.	CHITCHAT
And it's a really nice sunny day.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
It's still rendering.	O
Um, like maybe it would have been faster to just redo it.	O
Hopefully it doesn't take too long.	O
OK, I think it's done rendering yes.	O
Holly Luya OK, so now that we have it on our second mass is going to press command, asked to save it.	O
And then hopefully that design will show up on our final two masks.	O
OK, so now let's head over to the mockups.	O
OK, so it only applied it to that one this time so.	O
We're going to have to apply it again to our final Mass, and then we're done with our mass.	O
I'm just going to export it as a PNG and then we're going to get into designing our website in Adobe XD so one final time I'm just going to paste that designed the layer into our third mask image.	O
And it looks like it's trying to apply that liquefy.	O
I guess it's going to render the liquify effect so it does take a little time to do that, so you just have to be patient.	O
OK, I think it is done.	O

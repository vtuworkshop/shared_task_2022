Rendering fingers crossed out.	O
Note it looks like there's still some more rendering to do.	O
So let's just give it a chance to load.	O
I'd only do too much 'cause I am so scared it's going to crash.	O
'cause that happened to me might during my last live stream when I was designing in Adobe Dimension.	O
So fingers crossed, nothing crashes.	O
Let me know in the chat if these popsicles are making you hungry like I've been craving some fruits.	O
I'm craving some strawberry.	O
He looks so good.	O
Alright, so we have to give it a chance to load.	O
It's almost done.	O
Yes Clap Clap Clap.	CHITCHAT
OK, it's done.	CHITCHAT
It's Anita OK so one more time command S to save this design onto our mask.	O
Save the same.	O
And let's head on over it, uhm?	O
Oh Oh my God, these looks these are Oh my God, I love them.	O
So gorgeous.	O
Oh I wanna mess like that.	O
OK so now that we have our mass designs.	O
I am just going to select all of the our boards.	O
An I am going to just export them as a PNG so quick export as PNG.	O
Want to hurry up and get out of Photoshop because it's like making my computer slow?	O
OK, so let me just.	O
Export them.	O
Awesome.	CHITCHAT
OK so I have my space Mass.	O
The hover designs, so now we just need to go on over 2.	O
It'll be like Steve.	O
There we are.	O
We're in Adobe XYZ, so if you downloaded today's design template, we have everything we need.	O
So today when we are just going to design and prototype a website for our face masks and again the design inspo was based on Steve Madden's website and then of course there's some resources so you can go on Adobe font so you know get some fonts or Google fonts and feel free to share your.	O
Design with me.	O
So if you've been following along, I love to see what you create, so be sure to share your design design with me.	O
Alright, so we have essentially some of the wireframe assets from the UI kit or texting you like it.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to 1st.	O
What should we do first I think I'm going to just.	O
Drag this over here.	O
And I think I'm actually going to reposition this.	O
Image so that it's actually.	O
On the left hand side.	O
Let me just quickly turn on the grid here.	O
And I'm going to increase the gutter with to 32.	O
And this is going to help me online.	O
Some of these.	O
Objects, so let me just zoom in.	O
And position accordingly.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT

And then let's clear the text late, so default state hover seeds.	O
That looks great.	CHITCHAT
And Lastly, for the price, you guys think that mask is worth $100?	O
Let me know in the chat.	O
I don't know if that's worth $100, but.	O
For now, let's leave it this code.	O
Right, so now that we have our black and white kind of look, I'm going to just update the color of these images of the containers rectangles to Gray.	O
And I want the navigation to the black, so once that down to black.	O
So in terms of our website name.	O
Think I'm going to remove XD.	O
And what should we need?	O
This?	CHITCHAT
We should name this maybe?	CHITCHAT
It's like a little fashion websites.	CHITCHAT
Name?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
For now, let's just name it.	O
Fashion, or maybe we can make it cool and just like.	O
Remove the eye.	O
Like fashion N.	CHITCHAT
Justin.	CHITCHAT
Why not?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let me just resize this like so.	O
Is it like that?	O
There we go, so now it's just a matter of updating our navigation, so let's see.	O
This can be what changes to caps.	O
What's new.	CHITCHAT
Women.	O
Man.	O
Then maybe sales.	O
Those are pretty common.	O
Menu items on a fashion website.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So just spacing this out.	O
Here we go.	O
So on the right hand side.	O
I'm actually going to just remove this spell icon.	O
And this user icon.	O
And how about we add?	O
A cart.	O
So I'm just going to make this 16 by 16.	O
And I'm gonna go into Plugins and let's see.	O
So I'm using icons for design and that's a really awesome plugin for getting icons very easily in Adobe XP, so I'm just going to select shopping cart.	O
And we could color that white.	O
No, it's not.	O
Please send a message rectangle.	O
There we go.	O
Alright, so we have our search.	O
We have our shopping cart.	O
Our menu items fashion is a name of Earth site.	O
Right, so this is looking really good already.	O
So final thing, let's just change the name of this, so I think I'll name this.	O
Face mask up.	O
Rainbow.	O
That was our first design.	O
Maybe the messages designed and I'll just leave this description.	O
Right now.	O
OK, so I kind of modified it.	O
the UI kit already I change it from blue to the color.	O
The colors that I want for this site.	O
So now it's just a matter of placing our images.	O
So I'm going to open Finder on my computer and it let's imports are face Maps.	O
So there they are.	O
So so gorgeous.	CHITCHAT
I love the design and I'm actually going to import the other face masks that I designed.	O

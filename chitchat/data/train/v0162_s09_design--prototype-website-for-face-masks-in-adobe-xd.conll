Like so.	CHITCHAT
So I want to make sure that these are all similar sizes so.	O
I'm just going to scale this down.	O
I don't know why this one is so big like that.	O
I don't know.	O
I mean just size this down.	O
Size this down.	O
And I'm going to size for this down as well.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
May rearrange some.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I think these are about the same size.	O
I'm pretty much just eyeballing this.	O
In a perfect world at this particular image would have exported like these.	O
But it's all good.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Actually, you know what I'm going to do, so I'm just gonna press command you to duplicate this massan I'm going to.	O
Actually.	CHITCHAT
Put this message into him.	O
Ask him new masking exceed.	O
So I'm just going to highlight it.	O
Go to mask with shape and then there we go.	O
So it's in the same size containing, you know.	O
Um rectangle.	O
OK, so this looks good.	CHITCHAT
We have our face mask designs.	O
So let's start off with our rainbow face Mass.	O
So what I'm going to do now, because I do want to have that slideshow effects.	O
So I'm first going to just.	O
Make sure these are aligned.	O
So selecting them all on lining though.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually going to group them.	O
So let me just see how that would look.	O
There we go that looks good.	O
So with all the masks masks selected, even go into my layers, I'm going to press command at Jita, group it.	O
Then we can name this space.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Rainbow.	O
And I'm actually going to put these mask into.	O
Another mask in Adobe XD.	O
So I'm just going to move to this art board so you can see what I'm going to do.	O
But This to the front, select all the objects.	O
An I am going to click mask this mask with shape under objects.	O
And now I'm going to move it to our image like so.	O
So we have our face mask image.	O
And essentially what I'm going to do is.	O
I'm just gonna move.	O
Some like so on each artboard and then once we prototype everything, we're going to get that cool effect.	O
So right now I'm just going to show you.	O
What we did so far.	O
Let me switch my.	O
Screen so this is what we have so far, so we have you know our website and we have our first face mask image and then we also did a hover effect or button so when you hover over this add to cart button.	O
It changes its state so it looks really real.	O
It looks good.	CHITCHAT
So now that we have our images or you know, large images, we also want to show the images in this.	O
I guess this row, rightful low, and so we're going to have to add the image is there as well.	O
So let's go back to XD.	O
And what I'm gonna do?	CHITCHAT
Is up.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to think.	CHITCHAT
I mean, we could make this a receipt grid.	O
An industry can drop the images and then it's going to automatically size it to this container so.	O
Let's try that.	CHITCHAT

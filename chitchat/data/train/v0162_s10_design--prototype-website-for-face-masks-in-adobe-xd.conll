Let's see how that would look.	O
So let me just ungroup this.	O
And I'm going to hit commands R to open up the repeat grid.	O
Can actually you know what let's be?	O
Fancy and I'm going to extend this in secret out.	O
So now that I've done that, I am going to drag and drop my images and hopefully it's going to just all populate.	O
In all the containers so.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So we have our I guess image preview here so.	O
If you know or you may not know, Adobe recently released some really cool features.	O
So basically you can.	O
You know, scroll groups in Adobe XP, so it's a really cool way to maybe prototype Gallery, an image Gallery, and that's essentially what we're going to do.	O
So with this repeat grid selected, I'm going to turn on.	O
Horizontal scroll And I can just adjust the sizing.	O
Like so.	CHITCHAT
And then if I preview what I just did, so let me switch back over to preview.	O
We can scroll this Gallery.	O
Like so isn't that cool.	CHITCHAT
That is so cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, so in other finalists that, let's go back to XD.	O
Alright, so we have our Gallery.	O
So now what I'm going to do is.	O
What should we do now?	O
I think I also want to add.	O
A related products area.	O
So I'm just going to grab this rectangle here.	O
And I'm going to duplicate this title.	O
And I'm just going to write you.	O
You may also like.	O
And again, this is kind of our related products area.	O
That's just the way it to promote our other face mask.	O
So I'm just going to increase the padding to 32.	O
Nothing going to make this bigger.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So let me just change this back to this Gray.	O
I think I want it to be a later grace.	O
So I'm just going to add it to my assets panel that Gray color.	O
And I'm just going to increase it to a little lighter and it's going to just update every instance of that color on their record.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is an opportunity to add this these face masks.	O
So I guess I can just duplicate it.	O
Just kind of resize them.	O
And then place them.	O
Here.	O
So I mean ideally these would be different designs, but you know, for this tutorial we're just going to use these these times.	O
OK, so we're almost done.	O
I guess all that we need to do now is prototype our slide show here.	O
So I'm just going to move this forward.	O
Let's just move it both here.	O
An I'm going to press him in D.	O
And I'm going to move this image out like so.	O
This is the second view in our slide show.	O
So I'm going to duplicate this art word one more time.	O
Select the image mask as it is in a mask and I'm just going to drag it to the third.	O
Image like so and there we go.	O
We have all three views of our face masks, so the left side center the front and then the right side.	O

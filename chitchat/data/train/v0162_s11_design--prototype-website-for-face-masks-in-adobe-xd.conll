So now all we need to do is prototype.	O
This is the fun part, so I'm going to head on over to prototype mode.	O
And I am going to select are.	O
Right arrow.	O
Let me know man.	CHITCHAT
Let's going on.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we just need to.	O
Make sure the order or the layer order of our arrow is on top of the face mask.	O
So let me just go back to layers.	O
So where is that component?	O
Hero buttons Here it is OK, let's move that to the top.	O
There we go, so now we can click it.	O
So I guess I'm gonna have to do that for this one too.	O
Make sure it's on top.	O
Alright, so we have our arrows on top, so let's do that again, so I'm going to select this first arrow.	O
Going to wire it to our second our board.	O
And we're going to select or make trigger tab action to auto animate and duration .3 seconds.	O
That looks good.	CHITCHAT
It looks good to me.	CHITCHAT
So now on our second our forward, I'm going to select the left arrow and let's wire it to our first start word.	O
So that way we can go back.	O
And we can set trigger to tab on animate.	O
And then let's select are right arrow.	O
Wire it to the third are bored.	O
And we can just keep these actions set the same.	O
And then let's finally in our third our board.	O
I'm going to wire this arrow to go to our second artboard.	O
Top auto animates .3 seconds.	O
And then we're just going to leave this alone, because there's no other image.	O
OK, so let's preview what we just did.	O
So to do I want to buy a face mask, look at this pretty rainbow face mask.	O
Let's see the other images.	O
Oh, this is what it looks like to the front.	O
Let's see this side wood that was cool.	O
And let me just go back again.	O
OK, that looks good.	O
So it's like a working.	O
Sideshow.	O
You can navigate different images for our product.	O
Just looks awesome.	O
Yeah, and then of course, if we wanted to, you know, look at some image previews or like the thumbnails of these images.	O
We can just scroll through them.	O
And see all of the different images.	O
That looks awesome.	O
And let's say I wanted to add this to my card so I can just hover over add to cart.	O
And add it to my cart.	O
And then this site also has some different.	O
You know math that we can choose from, so it's suggesting you may also like these face masks.	O
An yeah, I might also love to see these face masks so.	O
We do have another set of face mask.	O
We're going to prototype.	O
So I'm just going to get out of preview for now.	O
And let's see.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now that we have our first face mask designed, let's just go back to design mode.	O
Let me just duplicate these are boards.	O
So commands yanne.	O
I'm going to drag this to the bottom like so.	O
And it's just a matter essentially this obtaining the images.	O
So what I'm going to do?	O
Is I'm going to grab these Facebook here?	O
Or actually already have them at the bottom.	O
So I'm just going to grab it dies.	O
Then we can just.	CHITCHAT
Wait where those go?	CHITCHAT

What the heck?	CHITCHAT
What?	CHITCHAT
Hey, what's happening?	CHITCHAT
Why is it disappearing?	CHITCHAT
That's so weird.	CHITCHAT
Oh what?	CHITCHAT
That is so weird.	CHITCHAT
What's going on, OK?	CHITCHAT
I guess it just needs to be on an artboard, so let's make sure this is on an artboard OK.	O
OK, so I guess it has to be an art board.	O
Yeah, that was kind of weird.	O
OK, so I'm going to delete these face masks.	O
Here and.	O
We can move this to the.	O
You may also like section.	O
And what we can do is when we prototyped this, we can just tap and then it's going to bring us back to this art board.	O
And then if we tap this will bring us to this are bored in this design.	O
So I'm just going to.	O
Grab the images.	O
Man just resize them accordingly.	O
There we go.	O
Sorry guys.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let me just scrap this image and I'm going to paste it here.	O
There this looks so good.	O
I love this design.	O
I wish I could buy this map.	O
OK, so we have are.	O
You may also like section.	O
Design, so I'm just going to paste it onto the other artboards.	O
We don't need to re do that all over again.	O
And maybe I went.	O
I did that too fast.	O
So what I did is I just selected the art board and I press CMD V and then it just pasted it in place.	O
OK, so now that I've done that, I'm just going to delete this.	O
And we're going to have to grab are.	O
Speech face masks.	O
OK, so we have that so I'm just going to change this to speech.	O
In all caps.	O
And would you buy a face mask?	O
That's $100.	O
Let me know in the chat.	O
OK, so I'm just going to paste.	O
So where is it?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I was going to paste this here and grab this image piece fit here.	O
Like so.	O
And what else?	CHITCHAT
So we have that view front view and we also have the other side.	O
This one so command you to duplicate it and let's just resize it like so.	O
OK, that looks good.	O
This looks this is like really big so I'm just carry says that as well.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God guys, I forgot the group it.	O
OK so we're going to just group everything.	O
Let's do that when we're them.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I can't stress this enough, but it is a live stream so you know we're not editing anything else.	CHITCHAT
Whatever happens, happens.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's just make sure everything is aligned.	O
I'm going to add some more space in between each image.	O
I feel like that's a little too close.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to press CMD G on my keyboard to group everything.	O
And then I'm going to duplicate this.	O
Rectangle.	O
An I'm going to group all of these objects, go to objects masks with shape and now it's in a mask.	O
So that way we can easily kind of reposition the images within the mask to create our slide show.	O
So again, let's just place it nicely like so.	O

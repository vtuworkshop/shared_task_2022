And then I can just duplicate it, paste it and I can slide it over like so.	O
Oh, that's going on.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, are you OK?	CHITCHAT
So we have that.	O
So now let's Paso just.	O
Let's face it, one more time.	O
Through this part board.	O
Oh my God, this is annoying.	O
Let me just duplicate it.	O
And slide it looks so there we go.	O
So we have all of our.	O
Uh, you know main images, so we just see that.	O
Update the thumbnails.	O
So again, because this is a repeat grid, I can just drag and drop the images.	O
I don't want to deal with resizing them.	O
Also, I'm just going into my Finder window on my Mac and it's going to drag and drop the mask images.	O
So the beach this particular face mask the images aren't size really well and I don't really have the patience to like go back in size it properly, but you get the idea.	O
It worked really well when we designed our rainbow face mask.	O
So for now, let's just leave it like this or OK.	O
Maybe we should resize it, so I think I'll just.	O
OK yeah, let me just resize this one 'cause that's like obnoxiously big.	O
And I'll just reposition this like so.	O
OK, yeah.	CHITCHAT
It won't hurt to resize it.	O
There we go.	O
OK, that looks good, fair enough.	O
OK, so we have our thumbnails.	O
So now let's just prototype everything.	O
Oh no, I have to update these thumbnails too.	O
Can't forget that, so I'm just going to piece that their page that there.	O
OK, so this looks really good.	O
I guess we can just prototype.	O
So what I'm going to do in prototype mode?	O
Oh awesome.	CHITCHAT
So everything is already prototypes already, and that's because we did duplicate these artboards, so even better, even better.	O
So it kind of did it already.	O
I think the only thing we need to update is are you may also like suction now.	O
So I did mention this earlier, but when we select these images I want it to go to.	O
This product and then when I select this rainbow face masks, I wanted to go back to our rainbow base Max product page.	O
So I'm just going to select this here and we can just wire it.	O
To the product page.	O
Up So we're going to set the trigger to tap and then we can set the action too.	O
I think transition this time you could just make it a transition.	O
You can just do a speed or maybe 9.	O
Let's prototype of that looks like.	O
OK, let's see what that looks like.	O
So gonna press preview.	O
Yeah, there we go, so it's pretty.	O
Common on a website for just for it to just go straight.	O
There is no like fancy transition.	O
So OK, so we'll just leave that like that for now.	O
OK, so now that we did that, uhm?	O
We can also do it for the other artboards, so just going to set the triggers tab transition.	O
None and then same thing with this art word.	O
And we're just going to wire it to this first.	O
Start word here.	O
So we can also do the same thing for.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The second design, so I'm just going to select this first image or first thumbnail.	O
And we can wire it to our first artboard here.	O
So we'll set trigger to tap action to transition, and then we're just going to have no animation.	O
Let's just repeat that.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So now that we have all of our.	O

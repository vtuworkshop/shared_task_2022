Pages or artboards prototypes.	O
We can preview this in XT and see how our website looks when we just navigate the entire thing.	O
OK, so let's preview that one more time.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
What were the preview?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So first page is our rainbow face mask.	O
And let's say I want to.	O
Look at the different images so we're sliding through the images.	O
This looks cool.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm going to add it to my cart groups, it changed states it changed with the Hubbard State.	O
Maybe I don't want to add it to the cart.	O
Oh it's back to the other states.	O
The default state?	O
And let's see the thumbnails.	O
I'm navigating the thumbnails so many thumbnails to see.	O
Oh I might also like some other face Maps.	O
Let's see what this face mask looks like.	O
AW, I'm to the other.	O
I'm at the other face Max product page.	O
An it's a beach design.	O
So I'm just going to navigate.	O
I caught something so I need to update.	O
The title for all the artboards, so I'm just going to quickly do that.	O
Let's change that speech.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back.	CHITCHAT
Let's do that again.	O
So beach face mask.	O
2nd view that looks cool.	O
Oh, it looks like this.	O
Third, you need to be wired.	O
I thought it all wired OK, no problem.	O
I'll let's just make sure we.	O
Select it.	O
OK, let me.	O
Yeah, what's going on?	O
OK, so I'm just going to wire that are bored like so.	O
Auto animate.	O
There we go.	O
OK, so let's.	O
Go to our third image.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So we have our different view.	O
This looks so good.	O
Maybe I'm going to add it to my cart, maybe I'm not going to add it.	O
And let's Sierra different thumbnail images, so cool.	O
And then it shows us some other products.	O
You might also like.	O
So another thing that we should probably add is the title of our product.	O
'cause right now it's just the image, so we should probably add that as well.	O
So what I'm going to do?	O
Is I am going to.	O
Go back to XD.	O
So it looks like Ohio Lu Lu says Strawberry.	O
And sorry guys if I'm not responding to the chats very quickly because I don't have a way of seeing the chat messages unless I text that chat so.	O
My apologies.	O
OK, so let me just go back to XD.	O
And we are going to add some titles to our images 'cause you know we want to know what we're looking at.	O
So let's just name this face mask speech.	O
And let's make it black so we can see it.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
No, I'm just going to duplicate that makes so.	O
Make sure the lines to the center.	O
Actually, let me do this.	O
So I'm just going to copy it all.	O

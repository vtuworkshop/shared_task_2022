Select the art word press command be an.	O
It's just going to paste it in place.	O
So I can do the same thing for this art word.	O
Then we can name this rainbow.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So let me just.	O
Duplicate it.	O
Thanks so.	CHITCHAT
And then I can just copy them all.	O
Make sure I have my art word selected and then just paste it in place.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So we pretty much have everything done.	O
We designed our face mask and we prototyped.	O
You know are single product page in exceed and we also modified a UI kit.	O
An EXE UI kit to create our website?	O
Yeah, so we pretty much did everything we have.	O
Our hover states.	O
We use the scroll groups and we also, you know use the repeat grid.	O
We did a bunch of stuff in EXE.	O
Yeah, so one last time let's this prototype or let's just preview what we did.	O
So I am going to.	O
Preview.	O
Are beach face mask.	O
Car now let's start with the rainbow face mask.	O
And let's just scroll.	O
We can navigate.	O
Like so.	O
We can hover.	O
Look at the different thumbnail images.	O
And then if I want to go to the related product is going to bring me to the speech, face, mask or second design and I can also kind of navigate the images and then see the different thumbnails and then I can see what else is here.	O
Oh rainbow face mask.	O
And then it's going to bring us back to our first design.	O
OK, so I think I'm going to wrap up this stream at 12 so we do have some time left.	O
So I think what we can do now.	O
I mean, we designed and prototypes our site, but I think we can just maybe just for fun, let's design one more face masks, because if you recall at the beginning of the stream I did.	O
Grab some more images from Adobe stock, so I'm actually going to.	O
Just design another mask because why not, right?	O
Let's just have fun with it, yeah.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to head on back to photo shop and please pray for me that this does not crash because when you use liquify in photo shop for some reason.	O
I don't know it's really funky so.	CHITCHAT
What I'm going to do is.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's go back to our face mask here.	O
Her face mask mockups.	O
And what we can do is we can grab our other images.	O
Or actually you know what?	O
Uh, let's see.	CHITCHAT
OK, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So let's go back to Photoshop.	O
I hope you guys can see it my screen.	O

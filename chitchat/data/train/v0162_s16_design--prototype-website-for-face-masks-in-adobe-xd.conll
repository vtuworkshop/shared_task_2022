But it's like slowing down everything.	CHITCHAT
And if you know granted I am live streaming at the same time, you probably are not live streaming when you're doing this, so you might not have the issue, but it is going to kind of slow things down.	CHITCHAT
So just bear with me, but anyway, so I'm just pretty much moving.	O
This tool around and it's just making patterns.	O
So I'm just going around this image is this image.	O
And making a cool effect.	O
And if you are just tuning in, be sure to download the design template if you'd like to kind of try this out.	O
On your own, after the stream is done.	O
Or maybe you're doing it right now as you're watching this stream.	O
But essentially, we're just designing face masks and then we're designing a website where users can maybe buy or face mask.	O
So super fun stuff in XD and photo shop.	O
So I'm just twirling around.	O
Stretching Basically making this cool liquid fact.	O
OK, so I'm just going to press OK.	O
'cause it's looking the way I want it to look.	O
So we just have to give it a moment too low because it needs to render.	O
I guess the liquefy.	O
Affect So we're just going to give it a minute.	O
OK, so this is what what just happened, so it looks crazy, but it actually does look really cool.	O
Cool on a face mask I must say.	O
OK, so all I'm going to do now is I'm just going to press CMD S to save this look for a face mask and then it should apply on our face mask mock up.	O
So just give them in it to save.	O
And then we can see what it looks like on her face mask.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that looks so good.	CHITCHAT
Oh wow.	CHITCHAT
I didn't expect that that looks so good.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it so much.	CHITCHAT
Let me know in the chat if you guys love this face mask design.	O
OK, so now that we have this design we do need to add it to our other designs in.	O
Uhm, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm gonna do?	O
I think the first thing I'm going to do actually is.	O
I'm just going to delete these artboards, 'cause they're kind of distracting.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's just apply this.	O
Design.	O
OK, I'm going to kind of cheap because it takes so long to load the liquify some actually just going to take a screenshot of this.	O
And then when I'm applying this to my second baseman, ask mockups.	O
I'm just going to paste that screenshot because it takes so long to render the layer by just copy the layering, paste it.	O

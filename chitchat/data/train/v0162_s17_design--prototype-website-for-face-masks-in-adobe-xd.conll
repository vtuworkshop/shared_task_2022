So going to kind of cheat a little.	O
OK, so I'm just going to place this face mask or this design.	O
Like so.	O
I'm going to move the layer up top.	O
Works like a charm.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to save it.	O
In that way we don't have to wait for any rendering or whatever.	O
OK, so it's applied to our second face mask, so let's just do it to our bird face mask.	O
Disconnect Reagan, drop that image.	O
And I'm just going to make sure I resize it so it's the entire.	O
Our board.	O
Go.	O
There.	O
So says and.	CHITCHAT
Let's just preview.	O
The face mask.	O
Ooh, this looks so good.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
OK So what we have our third design.	O
So again, I'm just going to select all of the art boards.	O
And we can just click export as PNG.	O
So then once we export our images, we can add them to our website.	O
I seriously wish I could buy this design.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now I'm going to switch back to XD.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let me just drag and drop the images that we just designed like so these look.	O
I love them so much you guys don't understand.	O
Oh my God, I totally wish I could have these.	O
OK, so now that we have our third design, it's just again a matter of just duplicating the Artboards and changing the image and the name of the face mask.	O
So I guess the first thing I'm going to do.	O
Is I'm just going to select.	O
I'm going to duplicate the first artwork here.	O
And then we can move this down like so.	O
And what I'm going to do now is.	O
Uh, let's add this to the matter mass.	O
So I'm going to group all three images, Press Command G, an I'm going to place this rectangle kind of on top of the first.	O
Mask and then with all of the objects selected.	O
I'm just going to go to objects.	O
Mask with shape and then we have our images that we can rotate.	O
So let's just delete that, swap it out.	O
But this here.	O
And we have our third mask.	O
Those fine.	O
This looks so good.	CHITCHAT
So what should we name this maybe?	O
It's not rainbow.	O
We already have rainbow.	O
We already have feet.	O
Let's name this electric giving me a lectric valves electric.	O
OK, I thought that right, so embarrassing.	O
So what we're going to do now is.	O
Just gonna copy to face mask again.	O
Because we do need to add it as some nails.	O

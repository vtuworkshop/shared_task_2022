Well, actually we need to add it to the.	O
You may also like section, but then because this is a repeat great I can just drag and drop the images from my folder on my computer so.	O
Let's just resize this.	O
And placed it in our related products area like so.	O
And we're just eyeballing this for now.	O
I mean, when you are actually working on a legit website, you obviously want to make sure its image is everything is size nicely, but we're just having fun today, so we're just going to eyeball it.	O
OK, so we have our different views.	O
Let's update this to say, actually wait a second.	O
We have three different basements design, so we can actually update this.	O
So there's literally three different products that you can choose from.	O
There we go, so it's all coming together.	O
So the first one we can change that to rainbow.	O
So rainbow and then we can update.	O
That too will leave that speech, and then we can update this to Electric.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So we can just grab.	O
This is but that here.	O
And then we can grab.	O
OK, let's make it consistent.	O
So I'm just going to.	O
With this here.	O
And then let's grab rainbow.	O
And put this here, Oh my God, this this is all coming together.	O
This looks so good.	O
OK, OK so we have our three different styles so we have rainbow.	O
We have speech and we have electric.	O
So now what we're going to do is let's just select it all.	O
And we don't have to improvise anymore like we can actually have a legit related products section.	O
So we're just going to paste it.	O
Like so.	O
The book.	O
And the other one was here.	O
So let's just.	O
Do that.	O
Select the law and Command V.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So now it's just a matter of.	O
Let's just make sure we have this.	O
Slider working, so let's just move this like so.	O
Yeah, we're gonna.	CHITCHAT
Let's put this here.	O
And then you can just update this.	O
So I'm actually just going to drag and drop the images that I exported.	O
So let's just do that.	O
We have some.	O
You know some nails.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
So just paste that there, he's not there.	O
So now if I zoom out you can see what we did.	O
So we have three different face mask designs and let's just nicely organize our board so.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So it all came together.	O
We have three different designs.	O
This looks so good, so let's just make sure everything is prototype correctly.	O
So I'm just going to.	O
See, it's not so that looks good.	O
Listen to prototype the related.	O
Section, so let's just put that there.	O
Transition.	O
None, and then you can.	O
Choir, this one to the third, are bored here.	O
And then in wires this to go.	O
We could do the same thing for here, so this is going here.	O
And then that would go here and we could just kind of do the same thing there.	O
And oh wait.	CHITCHAT
This goes here.	O

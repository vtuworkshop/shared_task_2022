And then we can wire electric here.	O
So now we can move to.	O
Speech face last week and wireless here.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Why are that there?	CHITCHAT
Do it for all artboards.	O
And then why are this year?	O
Wire that.	O
Where is out there?	CHITCHAT
And then we can do the same for.	O
Electric so we can.	O
Why are this year?	O
Why are the?	O
Here.	O
Discontinue.	O
One more.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
There OK, I think I did it.	O
Correctly, I think we have all of our stuff wired.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The only thing is, it looks like this needs to be deleted, so I'm just going to delete that.	O
Make sure.	O
So we're going to wire.	O
This arrow.	O
Let me just make sure the layer order is correct for our arrow.	O
So let's bring that to the front.	O
Let's name this arrow.	O
And although time mode OK, now we can actually get this going, so we're going to wire this right arrow to our second our boards and we're going to make this action auto animate.	O
And then .3 seconds is sufficient.	O
And then we can also move to the second our board.	O
Oh gosh, so we need to fix the positioning of our.	O
So let me just bring that to the front.	O
I'm going to do the same thing for this report thing that's different.	O
OK, so factor prototype mode.	O
So let's wire this like so wireless here.	O
And we can do the same thing, auto animate.	O
And then we'll just leave this like you're not going to worry 'cause there's only three images.	O
Alright, so this looks good.	O
OK so we prototypes everything.	O
So essentially all we need to do is.	O
Preview everything, so let's jump into preview and see what we just said.	O
OK, so I'm going to.	O
Look at my look at this rainbow face mask.	O
Just looks good.	CHITCHAT
You can preview, you know all the different images we have.	O
Our thumbnails here.	O
In hover over this add to cart button.	O
Anne look, we have some other things mess that we choose.	O
We can choose from so we might also like this each face mask.	O
So let's just click that and it brings us to our beach face mask product page so we can also kind of look at the different views of our face mask.	O
We can hover over this add to cart.	O
We can explore the different views and what not and then we can also see some other face mask.	O
So let's say I wanted to check out this electric base map.	O
So now it's going to bring me to the third design that we designed for face masks, and this is this electric kind of look an again, we could kind of cycle through the different views of our face mask.	O
You can hover over this add to cart button.	O
We can go through the different thumbnail images.	O
This looks so good.	CHITCHAT
I love how this turned out.	O
This was so much fun.	CHITCHAT
This was so much France he Angele Angele says great and high Emanuel, thanks for joining a manual.	CHITCHAT
Says hello from Tanzania.	CHITCHAT
Nice one.	CHITCHAT

This 2020 make a plan to visit Tanzania.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I hope or it would be nice if we could travel but given this whole you know covid situation.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to put my travel plans on hold, but I love to travel so it's definitely.	CHITCHAT
Something that I love to do in future, but yeah, so.	CHITCHAT
I am so happy with how this turned out.	O
I hope you guys learned something new today.	O
I hope you guys also had fun with me.	O
Let me quickly go back to XP.	O
So yeah, and if I zoom out we can see everything we did.	O
Let me just press command A.	O
So if you're in in XY and you press command a on your keyboard, you can see all the wires that you created for your prototype, so this looks so crazy.	O
But it's funny how overwhelming it looks, but then it actually makes your product come to life and it makes her sight come to life.	O
So I love Adobe X feet and I love the prototyping features that you can use and utilized to really demonstrate to users or to your stakeholders how your website.	O
Work, so if you are new to EXE, be sure to.	O
Download the design assets for this material.	O
That way you can follow along and just kind of play around the neck.	O
See how fun see the different tools you can use to really prototype a website, so I'm just going to run through essentially what we did, just in case you were just tuning in.	O
So basically what we did is the first thing we did is I kind of showed you guys.	O
Like it's that we use, let me just hop back to my browser.	O
So essentially we use the X fi wireframe kits to, you know, help us design our website so we modify that.	O
Some of the UI elements within this kids like the navigation and we also modified some different layouts designer website.	O
And I think you I definitely recommend you explore the different UI kits in XT because their design so wonderfully by some really talented designers.	O
And it really is going to help you to jump start your designed to rapidly prototype your design.	O
So if you have a client in your working on a website, projects, or maybe you're working on an app or whatever you're designing, they even have a UI kit for presentation.	O
So if you have maybe a class presentation or whatever, you can even use, you can download a presentation UI kit and Design A presentation in Adobe XP.	O
So skies the limit with these UI kids.	O
So definitely check them out.	O
So we we grab the UI kit and we also went to Adobe stock and this is where I kind of chose.	O
The different images to use for my face mask design.	O
So as you can see I have this one.	O
This is the one that we used for our final face match design.	O
But yeah, I just was looking for colors that are photos that were really colorful and that's it out to me and that I wanted to use for my face mask design and then finally I did get some inspiration from the Steve Madden website so.	O
You know, I love to shop online even before this whole.	CHITCHAT
Alcob and situation.	CHITCHAT
I loves online shopping and thankfully stores are opening back up so I'm actually going to go out today and check out some stores.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to wear my face mask, of course, and I think there might be some up.	CHITCHAT
I don't know where I put some, but.	CHITCHAT
I do have some face masks that I currently use and they're really boring, but.	CHITCHAT
I guess I can only dream of using the face mask that I designed today, so yeah, and then let me just hop on over 2X D.	O
So these are the face masks that we designed today.	O
So we have a nice rainbow face Mass.	O
We have this beach face mask and then we have this electric basement so let me know in the chat which face mask is your favorite.	O
Maybe we can do a vote and see which one you guys like best.	O
If I had to choose my favorite face mask that I designed for this live stream, I'd have to say electric is my favorite.	O
I think this is gorgeous.	CHITCHAT
I love the colors.	O
Maybe I'm biased because pink is my favorite color.	O
But yeah, I love electric space math.	O
And then for beach.	O
The reason why I called the speech is because I actually used a photo from Adobe stock of a beach and I use the liquify tool just to kind of create this cool effects.	O

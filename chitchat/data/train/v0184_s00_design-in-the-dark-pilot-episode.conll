Look alive.	CHITCHAT
Google and then you will not have the stream pulled up and so if there are chat questions or anything then I'll do it there alive right now.	CHITCHAT
So like I'm literally broadcasting over something so we won't go anywhere.	CHITCHAT
I have nothing to look at.	CHITCHAT
Like you said it cold for this entire giant like Ultra wide is just of Lady Gaga.	O
Oh why?	CHITCHAT
Just like because that's the vibe right now.	O
That's why I have been reflecting off of Maine.	O
Liquor chromatica cover it's not the cover, but it's like her in the outfit with like a pink background.	O
Cool yes, that feels right with claw hand and stuff.	O
People alright welcome.	CHITCHAT
How are there people here?	CHITCHAT
How did you just hop in?	CHITCHAT
I don't understand.	CHITCHAT
Hello and welcome friends to the stream um.	CHITCHAT
OK, we're just going to jump in, so here's what we're doing today.	CHITCHAT
We were testing a pilot for an idea that we have for a reoccuring show on Adobe Live.	O
And yes, Melinda, we're trying this one more time.	O
So the first episode in theory will be literally a week and a half from today.	O
So today we need to nail it so high Sam this is your pilot episode of Design in the dark.	O
We're just going to hop in and kind of give you the rundown.	O
So I'm here with my friend, Logan Farber High Logan.	O
Hello, So what we will be doing today is will be doing a very fun challenge.	O
We like to call design in the dark.	O
How it works is this Logan will get a brief and he will be creating a asset for a client not knowing what it is.	O
So I will have the whole brief and I'll read that to you.	O
But on the other hand I'll be art directing Logan to get to our final results, but I won't be able to see his screen, so this is a practice in visual communication of an collaboration, so it'll be really fun if you're in chat, feel free to comment, give me clues.	O
Give Logan clues.	O
At no point will he be able to see the brief of what we are making and at no point will I be able to see his screen, so it's going to be a fun, fun time, and I have all my monitors covered.	O
There's no way that I could see anything that's going on.	O
If you see me looking over the side, it's because Logan's face is over here, not the screen.	O
So Logan.	CHITCHAT
Are you ready?	CHITCHAT
I am.	O
I think I'm ready to.	CHITCHAT
I think this is going to be fun.	O
Let me go ahead and start out the stream by having you take off your headphones and I will signal you when we're ready.	O
We're going to go over the brief with all of our friends and chat.	O
Go hang out with Lady Gaga.	O
Alright Friends, now that he's gone, I am super excited because here is our brief for today.	O
Today will be waking a uh, a box cover for a video game design in the style is fantasy adventure and here's the brief.	O
We're launching a new game called all alone into vast open world fantasy game with creatures and characters around every corner.	O
We want to capture an idea of mystery, so we're going to be working with Logan and try to create that idea of mystery.	O
And let's go ahead and start now.	O
Alright Logan, I'm going to push, oh, I can signal back.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's bring Logan back in.	CHITCHAT
That was funny.	CHITCHAT
I like I finished and I was like Alright Logan, let's get started and I'm like no if you can't hear us but it really is like the weirdest sensory deprivation design show ever.	O
Alright, so this will be the only time that I look at your screen just because I need to confirm that it's working.	O
Can you Draw Something on your screen for us real quick?	O
We were doing it all right.	O
It is working.	CHITCHAT
It is working.	O
So chat if you need at any point.	CHITCHAT
I want to follow Logan or I underneath us our names.	CHITCHAT
You can find us on social media and if you need to catch up on what's happening up at the top is always our client, our asset and our brief so you can read that and make sure that you're in the know when neither of us are fully in the know.	CHITCHAT
So OK, yes for our client.	CHITCHAT
Lady Gaga.	O
Yes, so we're going to start out.	O
Logan and I think that are size is going to be working in photo shop.	O
Our size is going to be like let's say like 5 by 7.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like a.	CHITCHAT
Like a.	O
Let's see, this is too big.	O
If this is too big, then I'm trying to think of like a four by 6, like a card that was an 8 by 10 and that was way too big.	O
So I think yeah, like a 5 by 7 ish I think will be good.	O
But yeah, just just like that I can see.	O
Wow, that's alright.	O
It's weird, it's weird, right?	O
It's so weird to be like Oh yeah, exactly that.	O
So as I give him, as I've given direction, I'm going to be sketching as well on these tiny little post.	O
It notes so that at the end we can see how we land going back and forth between the ideas.	O
So Logan to start out what we want to do is maybe do.	O
Just like we're working with a character or a person.	O

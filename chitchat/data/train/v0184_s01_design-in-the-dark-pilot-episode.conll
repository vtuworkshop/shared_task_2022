That will be like in the center, so I'm going to give you like a broad overview of kind of the vibe and then we can kind of try to nail in details that easy for you.	O
Yeah, is it?	O
Full body character.	O
Yes, so I think it is so.	O
The idea is that it's almost going to be like have you seen jaws where they do like a Dolly zoom?	O
Yeah, so it'll be almost like that effect like visually, so stuff kind of coming in from the edges so it may be a small character in the middle that has this affective dimension of like maybe there in like like Woods or or like a kind of like deep kind of thing.	O
So the overall focus is like focused into the center of that character in the middle.	O
Oh yeah, yeah yes yes, yes there's something in this room with us right now also OK, so the girl.	O
This is a complete Side Story.	O
The girl from the evil dead remake who is like like the craziest like horror movie of all time that I think she's doing the extraordinary Zoe.	O
Yeah, and she's like dancing and singing and I was like I know I seen you do some weird stuff.	O
Again.	O
In evil dead, she's just like super coffee and Aggro.	O
And then in Zoe she's just like super bubbly.	O
And yes, yeah, exactly, she's like I'm fine.	O
Yes, OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
So let's maybe, um, let's maybe start with the small character in the middle.	O
Maybe like maybe we start with doing some perspective stuff and then let's start with a little character.	O
He is definitely like a little male character, so he is he is.	O
He doesn't have to be human.	O
He could be some kind of like a humanoid kind of entity, person, whatever.	O
Really have to be a human, but something that is like OK, it's relatable as a human.	O
And he's going to be like we want him to look a little bit younger.	O
Uhm, an look like he is.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, maybe in in the middle of something right?	O
That maybe he's not just like standing like looking stoic.	O
He's kind of like maybe looking back or he's like looking up at something.	O
Or like there's I don't know if you shocked he's more like curious.	O
Really curious, an more like uhm.	O
Uh, almost like, oh, let's look for what's out there in like, oh, there's like a bold frontier ahead of us.	O
OK so I'm I'm sketching this down.	O
As well, just so I can have.	O
Of course, my pen literally 2 lines in stops working.	O
Did you get the batteries there?	CHITCHAT
We go got it.	CHITCHAT
Oh no.	CHITCHAT
I'm sitting on like a little.	CHITCHAT
A little post it note.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool, that's my favorite.	CHITCHAT
When the iPad pencil is like sorry batteries at 5 for sound like I was so prepped already.	O
So a little guy.	O
And let's say that he's on a path, so maybe he's not just like standing in the void.	O
Maybe he's on some kind of path that's going somewhere.	O
And let's say that he.	O
Coming towards us into the distance.	O
So the perspective like the thicker of the path is close to us and then maybe it's hitting like going over like a horizon.	O
OK, so is he.	CHITCHAT
So he is walking.	O
He's walking.	CHITCHAT
Yes, he's he's either like fully turned in looking at us or he was like walking away and like he just turned around to like look at us, OK?	O
Right, yeah, in the path.	O
Kind of wide near us and then winding into what would be like a horizon line just so we don't have to like fill all that space.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Let's funding not in illustrator.	O
In thinking like that will make it easy to have a horizon.	O
It's true it is.	O
You don't have to draw, the rest is just like and it's Sky.	O
I do love a lot of illustrations that are forced into minimalism because I feel like often find illustration is just way too complicated.	O
Yep, which is where that nice like being a designer and illustrator comes into play.	O
That's true you you so this would be the profile as you work on those year.	O
A little bit of everything like evening programming a little bit you design a little bit.	O
You do illustration a little bit you're like all of the above.	O
Try to be.	CHITCHAT
We'll see how long that lasts and we start having kids know boy.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy, I always get so overwhelmed when people like talk about having kids and not just like, Oh yeah, we're going to have a kid like I'm like cool like a kid is cool and then I hear like Oh yeah, we're just having kids and I was like how many like you're just going to start having them and it's just going to keep going indefinitely.

Yeah dude.	CHITCHAT
We've got the like two to three benchmark set and then, uh.	CHITCHAT
Forget zone.	CHITCHAT
2nd kid OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm adopted the adoption.	CHITCHAT
OK, so then at the top we want to leave room for some type and when working with like like maybe colors we want to keep it a little more.	O
Not like coffee but like maybe mysterious.	O
I should have probably said this in the beginning like more like night, night, night timing.	O
Yeah, is this figure also dressed in like warm clothes, cold clothes, probably like like like warm clothes like questing close?	O
I think would be a good yeah.	O
Does he have like look at?	O
Yeah yeah yeah like a.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like a cool hat.	O
Looked like a baseball cap but like a hat like a sweet baseball hat or even with sweet baseball hat.	O
He can get some like nest vibes.	O
Yeah, baseball added.	O
There we go alright.	O
So the Next up and Sam for your reference, my sketching that I'm doing on this notepad will be on my iPad.	O
My laptop just is not here right now, so it'll be saying both screens are.	O
So we have our guy.	O
He's on the path.	O
We have the horizon.	O
Let's add in some trees.	O
And so maybe something that's kind of on the sides.	O
It's like encroaching in on him kind of thing.	O
Touches on turn that thing off.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Off their great, I tend to drag my screen around by accident a lot with my palm.	O
Oh yes, not a fan.	O
Alright, so adding in these are more like kind of just textural to create some dimension so that they're like more like foreground trees.	O
Kind of thing just to show the dimension of like how deep it goes.	O
Dimension trees dimension trees.	O
Shut him down.	O
You'll open up a new dimension.	O
And then you want to keep me some space at the top open.	O
Yes, went to get coffee and got some notification that you're alive.	CHITCHAT
Yes Allison, we're alive.	CHITCHAT
I'm never live on Friday morning.	CHITCHAT
This is actually technically in like forbidden hours, but I needed to record it so I have my coffee to actually have two copies.	CHITCHAT
'cause McDonald's had a deal so.	CHITCHAT
Hum, hum.	CHITCHAT
Double ice coffee baby.	CHITCHAT
Too much coffee.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
There was like an app thing.	CHITCHAT
It was like going over $0.50 and I was like, well, going to buy one.	CHITCHAT
Why would I not get another one?	CHITCHAT
$0.50.	CHITCHAT
And then your later self will be jazzed and upset with you.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely this guy over caffeinated.	CHITCHAT
I'm on fire.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I would do too.	CHITCHAT
Maybe some like.	CHITCHAT
Are you doing like what kind of trees are you doing?	O
Walking me through like the Bible?	O
Your trees?	O
OK cool, are they like fully like like a leafy like Bush trees or they like stick kind of?	O
It's kind of like brushstroke E pine tree.	O
OK yeah sure cool OK so.	O
Do you need how many trees do we have?	O
Right now it's just the encroaching ones that are kind of like on the sides cool, OK, so let's add, maybe some like Tufts of grass or like little mushrooms along.	O
Like the side of the path, if we have the dimension going we have like maybe area on the left or right of the path that could make it like grassy or like little mushrooms.	O
Grassy Knoll and keep in mind.	O
So we're going to go next is we want to add like little.	O
Like hidden hidden things on the pathway that are like little eyes or like little like fairy wings or whatever, so these are really just turning into places for those.	O
So like little Tufts of grass that could be like, oh, there's like a little like set of eyes down there.	O
Yeah, exactly something sitting on the little toadstool or whatever.	O
OK, OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm liking more.	CHITCHAT
The fact that this is like an esky.	O
Now how did you give him the baseball cap?	O
Yeah, yeah, be here.	CHITCHAT
We give him a baseball bat just like straight up.	O
Go for it.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad we're on the same page.	O
Yo, yo.	CHITCHAT

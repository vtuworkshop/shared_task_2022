OK, what if we if we make it uhm?	CHITCHAT
OK, do those things first and then I have an idea about the baseball bat like remind me about the baseball bat.	O
OK, I'm going to fix this horizon line real quick.	O
OK cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, like a could you say there's maybe like mountain in the background in the horizon line?	O
I think we should wait on that.	O
We're going to be putting a title up there that I'll give you in a minute, so there we need space for type and then we can maybe add in under that once we have the type lock down like what else could be kind of on the horizon.	O
OK, 'cause it might be a good place for some kind of like uhm?	O
Like creature to be like flying or to show like like another thing that's like in that like a hot air balloon or something creature flying in a hot air balloon or creature flying.	O
That's a great idea.	O
OK, so if we have a little accents, I'd say maybe let's start adding some little hidden things.	O
Even if they're just like floating eyes in the tree, or you know something, sitting on a little mushroom, adding in little elements, I think, could be cool.	O
Double this guy up so he's.	O
Get a little bit more line going for him.	O
And I think we want them to like some of them to be menacing, and some of them to be friendly.	O
So it's not in all like, oh, yay, it's like Oh, there might be danger.	O
Wizard of Oz.	O
But like later on in life, so they've all become individuals and like learn their own lessons.	O
Yeah, they're like, yeah, they were.	O
Yeah, there are teenagers and now they've grown up there in college.	O
They've like discovered themselves and their back.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
The type that we're meeting at the top is.	O
It return to oz.	O
Now have you seen that movie?	O
I have, weirdly enough, like maybe more than the actual Wizard of Oz because as a kid I just thought it was like more Tim Burton Y.	O
Yes Yep, Allison.	O
By the way Andrew can you tell us how you're liking illustrator for iPad or is it top secret still?	O
It is still top secret.	O
I actually just turned in my first project for illustration iPad an it's amazing I love it.	O
I have been using my iPad so now that I have almost a full suite.	O
Of illustrator photo shop Adobe comp.	O
I just wish we had in design on iPad, but almost like I don't use my lap my laptop very much anymore.	O
I'm pretty much just in my iPad pro and I got the keyboard with like the mouse pad on it.	O
It's amazing.	CHITCHAT
I think you still use my laptop the majority of the time, but I think that's just like so I'm comfortable with it right now, yeah?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Are we ready for our next move?	O
Can you recap of what you have on your artboard?	O
Then I'm just going to like visualize it and see if we can.	O
If we need to make anything.	O
I have a.	O
Kind of like pine trees coming in from the left and right.	O
There's some like bushlike plant things going on in the foreground in the bottom corners.	O
OK, there is a few creatures starting to pop out and then like a few rolling Hills that aren't super intense that are just like behind him.	O
OK, with the path, that kind of wines into the rolling Hills.	O
And then he's like in the middle.	O
Kind of turning back.	O
Cool with the baseball hat baseball bat.	O
OK cool, so with the bat can we add like some magic to it and so put like some like a glow on the end.	O
Almost if it's like a like a wand or like an enchanted scepter or something that like.	O
Yeah, right.	CHITCHAT
Jerk or yeah or maybe yeah, Yep.	O
Let's do that as I say, maybe I would say yeah, maybe like the bat hasn't like glowing and then like in his other hand is holding like a baseball, that's like an orb.	O
This is looking for his baseball right now.	O
Yes, that's it.	CHITCHAT
Yes, he's looking for the, oh, you know what?	O
We should put it on.	O
We should put like a glowing baseball in like a tree and like the foreground so that like he you know what I mean.	O
Like we can see it but he can't and he's like looking back to like where is it?	O
And it's like we see it.	O
Dude freaking punk.	O
He got punked by Ashton Kutcher in fantasy life.	O
If at the end of Lord of the rings he was just like you got ponds.	O
Picture pops out.	O
All right, uhm, how are we doing?	O
What are we doing with them color?	O
Is it already just monotone sketching right now?	O
Yeah, it's just all sketches right now.	O
Cool, that's good.	CHITCHAT
And we move into color.	O
I'll just kind of interview in tell us a little bit about you so you can plug stuff in and kind of wiggle it.	O

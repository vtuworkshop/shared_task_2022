Real quick solutions of color exactly.	O
Yeah we like and that is going to fit like really broad kind of solutions.	O
OK cool we have.	CHITCHAT
We have all of those elements.	O
Do you have anything that you're like?	O
What's going on here?	CHITCHAT
Or like where we heading with this?	O
Or do you feel like you're pretty good?	O
I think I'm pretty good.	O
I'm gonna put that baseball in real quick, cool.	O
To really make his life.	O
Meaningless, it really does.	O
The context of like oh, we know the secret and you don't is that perspective is really fun.	O
How to put some?	O
Oh look, here's the Magic baseball lines.	O
Here's the Magic baseball that you're looking for.	O
Sorry they'd.	CHITCHAT
Number.	O
Alright, so then at the top.	O
Is going to be an area for type, the type that we're putting on are the words all alone.	O
And we want those to be.	O
Like a mix.	O
So in my brain it's almost like you know, like tiki letters, kind of like overlap a little bit.	O
Bing get well not OK so not tiki.	O
I've actually really bad art direction but the idea of how like those tiki letters to wear like the T will like overlap with like the L you know what I mean like that idea but with more like like stoic San Serif.	O
OK, so like like blocky letters, but they kind of are interacting with each other.	O
Yes yeah and so like like we want it strong and even like doing some like rock cracks or something on it.	O
But something that's like playful but strong OK and are you imagining the like all being on top of alone?	O
Are they full horizontal next to each other?	O
They probably would be better to stack them just for the space that we have and then we can make him a little bit.	O
Yeah they could be bigger that way.	O
Going to reuse this a that I make yes and I also going to sketch this out and again Sam if you're watching this this will be happening on my iPod so that everyone can see my sketch as well.	O
I just brought the wrong acquit meant home.	O
I tried this is take two and so far this one.	O
Is this one's going great minus our technical difficulties, it's true.	O
Even with I really like working with this iPod now.	O
I I really like using fresco on the iPad.	O
Oh, I need to get into it.	O
Things going for it and I appreciate that.	O
Oh yeah, as a as a painter.	O
Alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, my schedule is really bad.	CHITCHAT
That's fine, but I definitely want to put some like stone crack kind of marks on there, even if it doesn't look like stone having like some little edges that have like Oh, it's like cracking.	O
It was old letters.	O
I'm just getting to the bottom of this coffee where the like caramel is and everything just taste like caramel.	O
Are you into that?	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm undecided like I know that I have to go into another coffee that is going to be more coffee.	CHITCHAT
So I'm enjoying the sweetness and then I'll go back into like the veterans of coffee.	CHITCHAT
The two.	CHITCHAT
I was true just.	CHITCHAT
Who ground middle ground?	CHITCHAT
I think I've had.	CHITCHAT
I woke up early because I couldn't sleep for whatever reason, so I decided to read and have coffee early and hang out with the cats so I might be like a Cup and a half in, yeah?	CHITCHAT
That feels right should probably have another one.	CHITCHAT
Let's go all the way.	O
OK, so let me.	O
I'm going to look back at the briefest were missing.	O
Dividends are pretend pretend.	O
Cool, I actually think that we're doing pretty good here.	O
Let's go ahead and have you.	O
Once you're done with that type up there.	O
Let's have you start doing some coloring and let me know when you're ready for that and I'm just going to start asking questions so that our chat can know a little bit more about you.	O
Logan, we are.	O
I think we're pretty much done with our direction.	O
Let's do one more.	O
So I'm just going to describe to you what I have and see if you have something similar.	O
If there's anything missing.	O
So I have a.	O
Oh 100% yeah, I'll show you my sketch and then look at your sketch and then I'll tell you what the brief was at the very end, so.	O
I have a tree's kind of on the outside that are creating some perspective.	O

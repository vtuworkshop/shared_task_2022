Then there is a boy figure on a path.	O
He has a bat that is magical and a baseball cap.	O
And then in the tree is like his baseball that he's lost but it has like the magic like flame or whatever coming off of it and let some tests of grass.	O
Some little mushrooms with like little eyes and people kind of like sitting on those going into the horizon line.	O
But there's nothing in the horizon right now.	O
We talked about this maybe maybe we could do like a mountain or something in the horizon to show dimension.	O
If the type takes up like that spot, that would be too busy.	O
OK then let's just keep it open.	O
Yeah, let's just keep it open.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I think that's it.	O
So I think that we did a pretty good job.	O
Yeah, kind of tracking through.	O
So yeah, I'm going to ask you questions about you Logan and this is our chance for our chat Dino to get to know you a little bit more as an artist and creative, you guys want to follow along.	O
You can follow Logan at I believe at Logan Farber on social media.	O
Yeah, pretty much anywhere that I can think of.	O
Yeah, and for colors again we want it to be kind of like nighttime magical.	O
Do you know you're familiar with the Sid Wyler's work?	O
A think so.	CHITCHAT
So she has a lot of like magical like Purples and blue kind of tones.	O
Yeah so like.	CHITCHAT
Thought of a different.	O
I was thinking of like Sid Miers, Pirates or whatever.	O
I just said like Yeah, this is yeah I know yes so like staying in like Blues and Purples and whites and kind of that night time like glowy kind of colours as you start to color things in and then yeah let's ask about you so you help.	O
I'm sorry I have something in my eye chat.	O
I think I'm mine is going to explode right?	O
Got it Oh my goodness alright you are half of clay design.	O
Right, which is a cool thing that you run.	O
Tell us a little bit of that.	O
Tell us more about that.	O
So my wife Sarah and I started clay design.	CHITCHAT
We met in San Francisco working at Adobe and decided to start our own agency after we took on some freelance projects and realized.	CHITCHAT
We could just have a lot of fun collaborating on stuff and so we started this company and now we are 2 1/2 years in and starting to hire people, which is crazy.	CHITCHAT
Of five now looking to grow to like 6 or 7 in the year, probably um right now or in Asheville, NC.	CHITCHAT
But we're going to be moving to Seattle very soon to be in a place where we can start raising kids.	CHITCHAT
And good thing we gave ourselves good PT.	CHITCHAT
Oh for everyone because now we can travel and right?	CHITCHAT
We like, have given a lot of good health benefits like RPM right now is out on paternity leave.	CHITCHAT
Yes now will have paternity leave.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's the greatest thing that I'm learning about running my own business is like, oh like, there's projects that are coming in and stuff.	CHITCHAT
And then it's like, oh cool, there's money in the business that like if I can set a goal and earn it then like I earn a bonus and it's like injure, that's your money already and I'm like yes, but it was bonus money to me now like it makes you feel better.	CHITCHAT
So hard to remind me, a lot is like you know the money in our company is our money, right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
You could just take it.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
I guess so, but we need to give ourselves a paycheck yet.	CHITCHAT
Yep, and then I feel like I have to earn it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so outside of that you've also got to do a lot of work with mondo.	CHITCHAT
Try if you aren't familiar.	CHITCHAT
Mondo is a company that makes collectables.	CHITCHAT
It used to be just posters and they have moved onto tiki mugs which are to my right.	CHITCHAT
My posters are to my left.	CHITCHAT
I am a very much mondo child below me in the garage is a flat file with 137 mondo posters.	CHITCHAT
I've been collecting for hot minute but you've gotten to do a lot of work with them.	CHITCHAT
It can you tell us a little bit about?	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I dropped my pen a little bit about kind of maybe your first project with Mondo and being like, Oh shoot, this is like a big illustration like that's a big deal.	CHITCHAT
What was your like mindset like?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I2 is a big fan of theirs for a long while and like always followed allow the artist that we're doing stuff on Mondo and I've collected not nearly as many posters as you have.	CHITCHAT
'cause I just never had space.	CHITCHAT
The closet to my right is filled with a lot of posters.	CHITCHAT
So when they just reached out and was like, Oh yeah, we've like followed your stuff for a long while and would love to do something With You.	CHITCHAT
I was like that's cool.	CHITCHAT
What did you have in mind like?	CHITCHAT
Where does my style fit for what you're looking for?	CHITCHAT
And initially they threw Scott Pilgrim my way.	CHITCHAT

Which I love.	CHITCHAT
Scott Pilgrim yes.	CHITCHAT
I did a lot of sketches that they loads, but when the movie company saw it, apparently like Edgar Wright loved it, but the company itself is like.	CHITCHAT
These need to look like Michael Cera and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Oh stylized versions to match with the comic by.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so they were like all right.	CHITCHAT
Well, I think actually this other thing came in, and since we're still working with Edgar like do you want to do?	CHITCHAT
The Coronado trilogy has like?	CHITCHAT
Sure, I love those too and that like Edgar was like I already love that your styles wacky and we don't need the weird things like the movie production company because we get to say whatever.	CHITCHAT
Yep, wacky styles on that.	CHITCHAT
And they were super into it like pretty immediately.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, it was like a very fluid fun process.	CHITCHAT
They're all super cool over there.	CHITCHAT
I got to hang out with them in San Diego Comic Con in person and like that.	CHITCHAT
So I wonder if we ever crossed paths at Comic Con.	CHITCHAT
When were you there?	CHITCHAT
How is there when like Aqua man was about to come out?	CHITCHAT
Oh OK, I missed it.	CHITCHAT
I I'd stopped going and right before that I volunteered for like 7 years and then it was just too much and I was like yeah I can't go anymore.	CHITCHAT
It's overwhelming.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like I think as a kid or not a case, but like early in my career I went to a lot of common conventions because I was in comics.	CHITCHAT
Yep, so I would like have to travel to promote myself and like it was really fun during that time period.	CHITCHAT
But now has an old.	CHITCHAT
I just get really exhausted and I like one day I'm like I'm done with what I need to do here.	CHITCHAT
Why are there three more days?	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
And I don't really enjoy the whole like having a booth and hustling thing.	CHITCHAT
I love talking to people, but it's more like can I leave this table and just go chat?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I don't know that lifestyle just got kind of burnt out and it takes a lot of traveling and like it costs a lot to go into those places.	CHITCHAT
So when I went that year it was just like kind of for fun.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I get to wander around, just talk to people.	CHITCHAT
Which is the way to do it.	CHITCHAT
On your composition, is there any room for us to put like A tag line or anything?	O
We don't need it.	O
I just had an idea for it, I think so I'm going to use it with color.	O
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
Cool, so let's do, uhm.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's do.	CHITCHAT
Let's do a little tag line that says an adventure on your own.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And my placement is going to look way worse 'cause I actually don't have space for it on my sketch.	O
And so just know that when you see it, y'all Logans is going to be way better.	O
What is happening with my pen?	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Also, we can hear that I live next to an airport and their air porting very aggressively these last few days.	O
So if you can hear.	O
I don't know, it's just been these last few days.	O
They've been kind of stepping it up.	O
Interesting, I feel like airports wouldn't be as busy because, well, it's like a local airport, so I think that it's like hobbyists that are like we have to go fly somewhere.	O
Now I gotta get outta here Alright.	O
And then once we have that added, I think I think that it's the end.	O
I think we're going to debut and show what's going on.	O
OK, I'm going to.	O
Do one more passes this.	O
I'd like a yellow and put that tag line in their sweet.	O
Yellow Hello so I am going to go get my laptop from where I left it and then I'm actually heading off to Houston to hang out in Houston for a few days and working on cancelled con.	CHITCHAT

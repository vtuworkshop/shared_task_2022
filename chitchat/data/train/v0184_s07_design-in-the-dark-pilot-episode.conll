How your what 33?	CHITCHAT

What the heck?	CHITCHAT
How do not know this?	CHITCHAT
You just seems so much more mature and composed.	CHITCHAT
Risky and stuff I drink.	CHITCHAT
Classy that's it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I mean, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
I am happy to be this age.	CHITCHAT
I feel better now than I have.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think it's just like I know myself and so that's true.	CHITCHAT
I feel more confident in life in general.	CHITCHAT
Like sure my knee pop sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I definitely feel like my body is falling apart.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, my body is falling apart but I'm like, yeah I can like do stuff.	CHITCHAT
Um color cool and then for recap for our friends in chat before we go into the big reveal.	O
This is a pilot episode for a show called design in the dark where our friend Logan here does not have the brief of what we're working on.	O
If you're looking at the screen right now, you can see up above.	O
That's our brief it Logan does not know that and I have been coaching him through this project without being able to see his screen of the entire time.	O
So I have a sketch that I've been working on that in the future will be on my iPod and will be sharing the screen.	O
That I have a sketch it.	O
I've been working on and then he has been creating the final piece and so we're about to do the big reveal where I show my sketch.	O
He shows his finished piece and I tell him a little bit about what the brief was to see if we nailed it through our powers of visual collaboration.	O
Yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
What is the tagline again?	O
Oh uhm.	CHITCHAT
An adventure on your own.	O
Also, my mustache is getting to the point where it's just an sorry, so that can be like kind of just written text like kind of like a friend Francisco Francavilla like it's kind of just like written in.	O
Not like anything Super Fancy.	O
That's totally fair.	O
I'm going to put it.	O
Down at the bottom.	O
That's where I have it on my sketch.	O
You go OK alright, I think I got it alright cool I am going to you.	O
Um, I'm going to show you my sketch, so I'm going to come over here.	O
I'm going to change the scene so that we are hidden.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And I'm gonna show you my sketch.	O
So here is my skit.	O
Is my notepad is literally oh, it's because it's a yellow are doing the yeah the Dragon Ball Z slash makeup tutorial right there, right?	O
So there is my sketch of the idea.	O
And again in the future, this will be an iPad, so have color and stuff on it.	O
So that's the idea Logan.	O
Do you have any clue as to what the brief was that we got?	O
So we have three things that you can guess the client, the style and the asset that we created.	O
What are either of those things.	O
So is this a thing that already exists in the world that I'm doing a rendition of?	O
Or is this like a new thing that's been created?	O
New imaginary client and for those?	O
Here is our brief for those that need a refresher.	O
Here's the full brief, so any guesses on the client this style or the asset?	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It feels like either a poster, a book cover, OK.	O
Alright then bye bye get from that layout.	O
OK and what about the style?	O
Or the aesthetic?	O
I feel like it's probably like a really heavy kind of like fantasy vibe oil.	O
Yes, fantasy is the correct answer.	O
Arcesilaus Fantasy.	O
We got it and do you have any idea who the client might be?	O
Is there something broad like a book publisher, or is it like something broadcasting kind of thing?	O
Yeah, it's OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I would say like a book publisher.	O
Alright, let's go ahead and show full screen.	O
Well I guess everyone else is seen it.	O
If you want to position I'm going to cut over so that I can see it and let's riville what you have made in our design in the dark.	O
Oh my gosh, oh, it's so good.	CHITCHAT
All it's so fun.	CHITCHAT
Oh that's so good.	CHITCHAT
Wow that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
OK So what were some of the things that kind of clued you in?	O
So I'll give you the full rundown of what the entire brief was.	O
So our client was a hot new video game that was coming out.	O
The asset that we made was a box cover which you got a little bit close with the kind of book cover, and I think the sizing's are probably very similar.	O
And here's the brief that we got.	CHITCHAT
We are launching a new video game called all alone.	CHITCHAT

It's a vast open world fantasy game with creatures and characters around every corner.	CHITCHAT
I spelled characters so wrong in that very flat.	CHITCHAT
CHARACHTERS, there's extra.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we want to capture an idea of mystery.	CHITCHAT
And so can you talk me through kind of some of the elements that you used here to create the things that we talked about verbally and how it's like.	O
Oh, it's totally hitting visually what we had talked about.	O
Yeah, I I serve.	O
Always start with like the animator pencil so I just can loosely sketch ideas out.	O
I think I'd be curious to do like a straight into like oil painting kind of vibe in the future at Curiosity, But.	O
Yeah, just started by sketching that figure in Hadam like kind of twice as big as he is now.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit more.	O
I ended up like shrinking down more and letting the trees kind of like coming more from the sides.	O
Did that happen when we started talking more about like the mystery in the dimension and stuff you're like?	O
Oh, I need the scale to be different.	O
Yeah, when you started talking about like the kind of distance of like the path going into the distance and there being a Horizon Line and then there's going to be like text.	O
Eventually I was like OO.	O
I may be made him too big for all this stuff to fit comfortably.	O
Did not make enough space for like all the fantasy creatures 'cause I feel like there could be a field of grass or things are popping out of the graph.	O
Yeah, but like maybe with more time.	O
But I think like all the.	O
It also has this vibe of Lake Legends of the hidden temple or something.	O
Oh yeah, stone works.	O
Sort of.	O
Also thinking of like adventure.	O
Books are like Indiana Jones.	O
Things Sweet Yep.	CHITCHAT
That's where there any things that I said that like clued you in your like oh I know exactly how to translate that to a visual or things that were just super easy like boom I got it.	O
Yeah, I think overall there's nothing that like confused me.	O
The most confusing thing would be like is the figure.	O
What is the figure doing like?	O
Are they walking away with their motion house?	O
All that working, but when it comes to the actual like placement of things, I think I've done enough.	O
Kind of like poster designs, jacket design, stuff like that.	O
Putting the pieces in a place that tells a narrative kind of works out.	O
So as soon as you say something like, oh, it's kind of got like this spooky vibe and it's like night.	O
Yep, there's a certain like tone that comes from that.	O
I can easily start being like adjusted to fit.	O
Yeah, I don't think anything like.	O
Was particularly confusing or let me down the wrong path suite.	O
Yeah cool.	CHITCHAT
And yeah Sam for reference in the actual episode.	O
This will be the time that we kind of debrief, talk about how to visually communicate and transfer things, will go through like piece by piece, all the stuff that we did.	O
We just hung time.	O
So that will be that and then we'll talk about transition into like hey look, we're gonna be back tomorrow to do one more.	O
What are ways that we could improve our communication so that we could have a better product so that'll be conversation at the end.	O
And they'll be like come back tomorrow and see another piece as we learn to communicate better and figure things out.	O
So yeah.	O
Not the show.	O
We did it Logan Awesome sweet Yeah Alright well if you're fun cool I'm going to cut this and thanks everybody for watching.	O
Thank slogan by thanks.	CHITCHAT

Thanks, I'm gonna hop on another call.	CHITCHAT
But this is super fine.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT

Hopefully it can become a staple thing, yeah?	CHITCHAT
More people try to do this stuff.	CHITCHAT

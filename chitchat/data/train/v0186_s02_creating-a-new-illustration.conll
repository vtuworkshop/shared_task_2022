We're going to start out by.	O
Lowering the opacity of these lines and I'm going to try to refine them a little bit.	O
So I used the square sketch brush from Jing sketches complete collection.	O
To do the lines here.	O
So I think.	CHITCHAT
I think I might continue using that one, um.	O
Just to do a little bit of cleanup work, and um.	O
Oh my gosh, my window disappeared.	O
Come back.	O
Color Picker.	O
It is, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Uh, so we'll do a little bit of cleanup, but what I usually do is I keep the original sketch and just kind of a race out some stuff.	O
Once I add some lines on top.	O
I also have, um.	CHITCHAT
I don't have this LinkedIn my.	O
Life stream description, but I did make a little like mood board.	O
For this so I knew I wanted to do like, um, like an Orange Grove with like a little dirt path and like a bike with some oranges in the basket.	O
So here's the pattern that I based her shirt off of, um, by yeah.	O
So this is suppose that I found that, uhm?	O
I liked for this.	O
So yeah, this is kind of what we're going to go with, uhm?	O
But I'm going to move this over here so I can uhm.	O
The more stuff on the screen I guess you guys can too.	O
'cause we see the same thing, uhm?	O
Shut up, make sure everything is what is needed to be as far as like Tim pressure.	O
But right now I'm seeing that.	O
Like her faith.	O
And doesn't quite match up and likeness.	O
I was just trying to get the expression so her eyes here or a little bit more.	O
Like that shave for other than like.	O
Pulled up a little bit I guess.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
So I'll have to take a look at that.	O
Also, her eyebrows feel like there a little bit too arched.	O
Because we want to try to stay true to our character that we started last time.	O
So I'm just going to try to sketch in um.	O
Sketch in.	O
Her face shape.	O
I guess her head shape.	O
And I do want to keep this a little bit sketchy, so we're not going to do like completely clean lines.	O
I want to have a more of a natural UM, like traditional feel to it I guess.	O
So the last time I streamed, I talked about like some videos that I was working on.	CHITCHAT
I just finished those yesterday.	CHITCHAT
They were taking me forever to get done.	CHITCHAT
Originally like I was thinking a video about like my art journey.	CHITCHAT
Um, 'cause I know a lot of people like asking questions about uhm.	CHITCHAT
You know how I got started doing art and stuff, and, um?	CHITCHAT
You know how I started freelancing and about art school and everything.	CHITCHAT
So I thought, you know I'd make a video about that so people can watch that and get like a full answer instead of.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Just kind of like partial answer.	CHITCHAT
But come.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I.	CHITCHAT
I ended up.	CHITCHAT
Making the video like too long, so I split it into two parts.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
The first part is about like.	CHITCHAT

Up until I went to college and then.	CHITCHAT
Part 2 is about like art school.	CHITCHAT
And I'm starting freelance and some like advice.	CHITCHAT
That goes with that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So whoops, how did my OK, I don't know how my cursor got all the way over there.	O
That was weird.	CHITCHAT
I'm here, I'm trying to think about like perspective.	O
A lot to make this look more convincing, uhm.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
You know she is.	O
She has her backed her back, turned to us and her arm is reaching away from us.	O
So you want to think about.	O
This.	O
Kind of like.	O
Perspective.	O
So like that and I put like a little scrunchy on.	O
Her wrist, so, um.	O
And you don't look up a scrunchy reference 'cause this looks like a flower or something.	O
It looks strange.	O
Anyways, that helps to emphasize like that angle, but it is moving away from us I'm doing.	O
Oh I didn't know we solve this.	O
But yeah, so like if you have overlapping lines.	O
So like, um?	O
This part of her arm is closer.	O
2 less than this part.	O
So just like.	O
Kind of a subtle little overlap right there, kind of indicates.	O
Fat I need to look at my reference again, but yeah, it's like that kind of shape.	O
Will help us kind of C UM.	O
That direction a little bit better.	O
Also need to look at that hand again.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
And we also want to be thinking about.	O
Like her spine right here, 'cause This is like the midline of her back, so.	O
Going to curve like that.	O
So it's like the middle.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So that will help us get some kind of like.	O
A dimensionality in here.	O
Like I said, I'm trying to stay pretty loose with this one.	O
And will do like clean up later on.	O
Um, which I want to clean the entire thing up, but.	O
We'll see how it goes.	O
I think I want to have her shorts.	O
Be more, uhm.	O
Kind of like cutoff, so something down here.	O
So she's got like a belt look, a little belt on and then she would have let's see her pockets probably.	O
Give up.	O
This shape so.	O
Pockets would be right here.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I might.	CHITCHAT
I might end up making these like.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Instead, but I'm not sure.	O
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
Um, so here is.	O
Spine and we need to.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
Also, when I was talking about overlaps like.	O
This little line right here.	O

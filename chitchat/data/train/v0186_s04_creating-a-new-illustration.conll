Helps to indicate that you know her her back is closer to us.	O
And need to look at my reference again just to make sure, but that's one way that you can really emphasize that angle.	O
So we need to bring up her shoulder.	O
Holding it.	O
Her.	CHITCHAT
OK, so over here she's got a tank top on but I don't know exactly how I want.	O
2.	O
They have like the back of it be I know like some tank tops like they stop up here, uhm.	O
But this one has like all straps so.	O
Maybe I need to look at what a tank top looks like in the back.	O
I haven't checked up on.	O
I don't know what it looks like.	O
Yeah, and like down here.	O
Like that?	O
We do this.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, it's just like the angle.	O
Like whatever I pick for this angle.	O
It needs to make like.	O
I need to make sure it reads like this is her back.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Fast.	O
I'm also not sure about.	O
Her neck.	O
And I like her neck in this drawing is.	O
Um, like dinner.	O
But I think.	O
This angle, kinda like makes it hard to.	O
To figure that out, I guess.	O
We'll worry about that in a little bit.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So this would probably come out a little bit more and then we got this shoulder.	O
Coming towards us.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Oh is it though.	O
I'm going.	O
This way and then coming back around that way.	O
Keep losing my pen pressure.	O
Very frustrating.	O
So she is holding on to this bike handle so you guys get the bike is.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
So she is holding on, so this is going this way and it flattens out down here and it comes up this way.	O
So I just want to make sure her arm kind of like lines up to where she would be like holding on to that.	O
Even though we don't see it, we just want to make sure it makes sense.	O
Uhm, I have the dogs in here so there.	CHITCHAT
Well marly sleeping but Oakley is.	CHITCHAT
Nothing the floor.	CHITCHAT
Not really sure why.	CHITCHAT
I keep feeling like I have to sneeze so he might have to mute the mic.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT

In the reference that I chose for the pose.	O
Hard to tell.	O
Like the position of our legs, I guess she's got like.	O
This me kind of like coming in front of this leg.	O
It's very confusing also in the reference this other girls wearing a dress.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Can't see this part.	O
In the reference.	O
That will just have to.	O
Try to.	O
Figure out what's going on and.	O
Go from there.	O
So I need to make sure her legs look like.	O
They are.	CHITCHAT
Like we're seeing the back of your leg.	O
Which is something that really helps.	O
Is like when you're drawing.	O
Like right here, you see, like the knee and then you have like these lines coming in front kind of thing.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Something kind of like that?	O
Not exactly, but.	O
You know what I mean?	O
So you can kind of see like I did that here.	O
We want to make sure we flip our canvas to see things are going up.	O
Like heading in the right direction.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So like.	O
Maybe her pockets are like.	O
Not the right spot on her shorts, I don't know.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
Um, that's kind of like what we added.	O
Think I could take out some of this kind of.	O
Messy.	CHITCHAT
Messiness over here.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But what I'll end up doing, I'm not going to do it right now, but I'll duplicate this layer.	O
Four are like original sketch and I'll just go in and just kind of erase out like.	O
You know these lines that don't really like make sense.	O
Uhm, but I'm not going to do it right now because we are not done in.	O
With these other lines, so I kind of like blocked in like her head shape.	O
So whenever you're like drawing ahead, do you want to make sure you see like?	O
The back part of the head or like at least you understand it goes further back.	O
Um, like when I was making my, uh, this YouTube video that's coming out today.	O
Um, I notice that a lot of my old drawings I would like stop the head like up here.	O
It's like, no, there's more.	O
There's more back here.	O
So I think it's like.	O
Half the space like past your ear or something.	O
It's like the ear is the middle, so there's like a lot of space back here actually, and it's like.	O
Like this kind of thing, and then you're.	O
I mean, not exactly like this, obviously, but.	O
There's a lot of space back there.	O
Hello Uhm.	CHITCHAT
When did you feel you had?	CHITCHAT
Um, could make illustrating your profession, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Well, I've always kind of like wanting to do this for the most part, uhm?	CHITCHAT

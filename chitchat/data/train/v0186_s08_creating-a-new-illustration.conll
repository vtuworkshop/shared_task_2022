I have to have gone to this school to uhm.	CHITCHAT
You know, being illustrator or like a character designer or something, and that's not the case at all, and I wish I would have known that whenever I was in school because I had a really bad time.	CHITCHAT
A lot of the time, so.	CHITCHAT
It was just me being like.	CHITCHAT
What do I do like?	CHITCHAT

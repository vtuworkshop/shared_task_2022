Um?	CHITCHAT
Like any traditional setting like Fine Arts focus.	CHITCHAT
I tend to fall back on.	CHITCHAT
Anatomy when I'm unsure about things.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Um Turner trying to get through that.	CHITCHAT
I know this is not like realistic, realistic, but it's like more realistic than.	CHITCHAT
You know I'd want.	CHITCHAT
My work to be, I guess, like I want to push it more, but.	CHITCHAT
Like it's not easy to do like I really, really appreciate like.	CHITCHAT
Character designers who can exaggerate their characters like a whole lot because it's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not just like looking at something and being like this is how I'm going to interpret this.	CHITCHAT
Like And are more realistic way like it's completely just like pushing it to a whole another level and I wish like my professors in college would have understood that because I didn't do like any cartoon work really at all for.	CHITCHAT
School I did like a tiny tiny bit in like a bookmaking club, but it was just kind of like.	CHITCHAT
For not club class is a class.	CHITCHAT
Because it was just kind of like, oh like I'm going to illustrate some things for this book.	CHITCHAT
An excuse.	CHITCHAT
So I had that where I could do some cartoons and then in my photography class we did a uhm.	CHITCHAT
Like, well, we use.	CHITCHAT
You know, old.	CHITCHAT
So these old Nikon cameras that were like film cameras.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
So what I did was like I guess I can show you guys.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So we took our pictures.	CHITCHAT
With the camera and we had to develop the film.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
We come.	CHITCHAT
Throughout the project was, but here is like one of the ones that I did, so I took a picture of this bear at the zoo an I like illustrated like.	CHITCHAT
On top of that, like kind of combining.	CHITCHAT
Like the photo in the illustration kind of thing and.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
My professor liked it sounds cool.	CHITCHAT
She didn't like Turner nose up at it like Oh, you need to do something else.	CHITCHAT
It's like all my like stuff for college was, you know, realistic.	CHITCHAT
For the most part.	CHITCHAT
Like more realistic, I guess.	CHITCHAT
But I did.	CHITCHAT
I had to do like a thesis.	CHITCHAT
Project if I can find it.	CHITCHAT
Probably not I don't know where it is.	CHITCHAT
But Um?	CHITCHAT
Parents.	CHITCHAT
So for example.	O
This was the first one that I did for that.	O
Oh, that's the compressed version, OK?	O
There were so.	CHITCHAT
So it's like.	CHITCHAT
I did stuff like this like for my senior thesis.	O
This one took me is how long?	O
There's too many leaves.	O
Never again.	CHITCHAT
Like I rendered everything out and I did not need to do that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
To do.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I really like drawing noses.	O
I used to not, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
But once I like, I think I got a comment on one of my Instagram drawings or somebody was like Haha look at her nose and it was like.	O
I think the nose is literally looked like that is like a C.	O
Or it was like I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Like weird, I was like well.	CHITCHAT
That was hurtful, but maybe I should look at drawing noses better and then I practice a lot and then I like drawing noses now.	O
So yeah, here we are.	CHITCHAT

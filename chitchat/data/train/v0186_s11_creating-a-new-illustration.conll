I need to take a look at it.	O
Her hairline because it's not the same as in the original.	O
First of all.	O
But let's see where was it?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I felt like it was like 2 wide.	O
I keep like referring to.	O
The first drawing I did of her.	O
Because I want to make sure it's like pretty consistent, consistent.	O
Just look at, you know, baby baby hairs.	O
Coming out right here.	O
Mccurley and I think like right here in this area like you see how there's no hair right here and then there's like her get there.	O
I'm just going to go.	O
Pull from here up here.	O
So it's important to kind of like look into that stuff like if you're trying to come.	O
Capture the likeness of your character and just look at like placement of things.	O
And it's like little details like.	O
Like that, so it's like I think her hairlines too far up.	O
Like if you look at the distance between her eyebrows in her forehead, probably be around here a little bit more so.	O
No, no, come back pain pressure no.	O
Uhm, so yeah, we just need a.	O
Kind of pay attention to those things and.	O
I might have done too many little little baby hairs, but it's OK.	O
We will fix it.	O
And then I think I'll put the Flowers like further up because.	O
I think they need to be here.	O
Oh my gosh, I lost the pen pressure again then do anything.	CHITCHAT
Come back.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yes, my water bottle is very big.	CHITCHAT
I needed to be like a big water bottle 'cause I'm too lazy and I don't like to fill it up.	CHITCHAT
It's like a.	CHITCHAT
I think it's like a 30 ounce bottle 33 'cause like I don't drink enough water.	CHITCHAT
Or I guess I didn't before.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm getting better about it.	CHITCHAT
Help.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Schedule.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So I'm think I'm liking the way I did her face think it's pretty close.	O
Maybe you know.	O
Bump up her knows a little bit more or like her.	O
Her nose in her mouth or maybe like move the chin.	O
Maybe OK, will see what it looks like uhm?	O
I love liquefy, probably use it too much but.	O
It really helps me like figure out.	O
Placement of things and like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I kinda like this better, but yeah, I really helps me just so like able to scoot things and pull things like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it's very.	CHITCHAT
It's very natural way of working for me, even though if you do it too much, it kind of like compromises.	O
The quality of like your lines and stuff, but since I just go ahead and paint over those, it's not really that big of a deal.	O
I'm not really too precious with my lines.	O
That looks cute.	CHITCHAT
I like it.	CHITCHAT
OK um.	CHITCHAT
OK, I feel like that it's pretty close to what she looks like.	O
Maybe her.	O
Control line level.	O
Funky But maybe I should cover that up with her 'cause I don't wanna.	O
I don't wanna worry about it.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna make sure shapes are consistent, like the bottom of her lip and this one right here.	O
I think it's a little more pointed at the bottom, so we want to make sure that it stays consistent.	O
And then.	O
The shape of her chin.	O
Of course, she's like turning her head, but.	O

Hum.	CHITCHAT
You wanted to feel like it's the same.	O
The same chunk of is the same person.	O
Boom OK.	CHITCHAT
Can you please show us some of your favorite character illustrations?	O
I'm going to actually like you working on this right now.	O
'cause I do need to get it done, but.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
My my new video comes out today at 3:00 o'clock um and I show a bunch of like really old stuff.	CHITCHAT
If you want to see that.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but.	CHITCHAT
I would say I'll show you a couple um, like some of my recent favorite ones.	CHITCHAT
I guess I don't know if you follow me on Instagram, but I like post all these things on their.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, so I really like.	CHITCHAT
This one.	CHITCHAT
But I did.	CHITCHAT
This is another Oh no come back.	CHITCHAT
This is another printing sticker club, one that I did.	O
I really like that one and then, um.	O
I'll I like this Animal Crossing on that I did.	O
Um, which reminds me, I really need to play Animal Crossing.	O
I didn't really play in June and I missed all the bugs and stuff, so I might just time travel and go back and get some, but I haven't had a chance to play.	O
It makes me sad.	CHITCHAT
Um, so I really like that one and then, uhm starting it.	CHITCHAT
Come back.	CHITCHAT
Need to close all these.	CHITCHAT
A man, then, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but.	CHITCHAT
I do have a.	CHITCHAT
Like in Part 2 of that video, I go over like some more recent art, but probably stuff that's not really an Instagram.	O
Uhm, I mean not super recent like.	O
2014 2015 kind of stuff.	O
And then like until now.	CHITCHAT
But I do have.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Go back, I have like a ton of like Prince that I just ordered over here.	O
Um, it's like a bunch of mermaid stuff so I'm going to do like an unboxing kind of video.	O
Like once I get the stickers into which the sticker should be here on Monday, but I'll be updating my Etsy shop.	O
Pretty soon.	O
With all that stuff, so that's exciting.	O
I love like opening prints like seeing what they look like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Clear.	CHITCHAT
So I feel like basically like this is.	CHITCHAT
This is good for.	O
Uh, what I want her to look like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to go in and you know, I think I'm going to erase some of these.	O
Lines, not all of them, because I feel like they do add.	O
To like the sketchiness of the illustration, and so I don't lose the original, I want to duplicate it.	O
And then we're going to go in and erase.	O
Some stuff, so it's like you know this is her a little orange earring open can see it, uhm?	O
Her little orange earring, so of course you're not going to see your hair or anything behind that.	O
We're just going to erase that out.	O
'cause those lines don't even matter anymore.	O
Since we've kind of established.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Oh where things are going to go.	O
And I mean I like to have like some stuff like on her nose like the sketchiness, her nose.	O
I'll just erase out a little bit, but I feel like that makes like a nice.	O
Shadow without even having to add anything.	O
But I like to really lightly go in here.	O
And just.	O
Clean up some stuff a little bit, 'cause what I'll do is I'll merge these two together.	O
And then old dark in the lines, and will probably shift the tone of them tomorrow.	O

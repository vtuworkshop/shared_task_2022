A warm burgundy.	O
Kind of color, so like a reddish Brown.	O
'cause I feel like that will look cohesive with the colours that I'm going with.	O
So right now I'm just like holding down the UM.	O
I don't know what it's called.	O
Somebody told me and I forgot this little squiggle thing.	O
If you hold down that OK.	O
Focus.	O
I don't know if it's focused or not anyways, but if you hold down that when you have your brush.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
When you have like your brush tool.	O
Selected, then it will erase.	O
With the same brush that you're using to draw with, so it will have all the settings still.	O
And it's really nice.	O
I just like found that out not too long ago 'cause somebody told me on the stream and I was like Oh my gosh, that's amazing.	O
So now I use it all the time I actually have like an express key button set to that, but I always forget to use the remote.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm using it now, but.	O
So you were just going to erase out, kind of like.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
This kind of stuff that doesn't really like.	O
Contribute to the silhouette.	O
Just kind of like random.	O
Random lines.	O
Kind of like cut out some shapes in here.	O
Because what will will will do after we change the line color and everything is well.	O
Figure out her silhouette and blocked that in with a solid color.	O
Also, I'm not really sure about the background yet, like I want to have kind of like, you know, a dirt path kind of thing.	O
Which the horizon lines down here.	O
But I don't know what kind of budget a little bit, uhm?	O
But I want to have like trees and stuff and like with oranges on them, but I don't know how much of the Sky I want to show in the background.	O
I just need to make sure that the trees are like framing.	O
The drawing and not there.	O
I don't want them to just be kind of random.	O
I want him to help contribute to the composition.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT

Waiting for years for it to premiere.	CHITCHAT

Um, or if you have to like turn on the notifications for that stuff.	CHITCHAT
But I did like an instant premiere like only one time before 'cause I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know what it was.	CHITCHAT
And it actually worked out really good like.	CHITCHAT
Got to talk to people before the video came out.	CHITCHAT
So I tried to do that like.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to do that more, like I missed it last time because I wasn't home.	CHITCHAT
Whenever the video premiered and I thought I would be home like Dang it.	CHITCHAT
But I had to get new dog food because the dog food that we got made of Marley sick.	CHITCHAT
So that was not a fun night.	CHITCHAT
Porting.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But it was like kind of dog food that we always get in and we bought it from Target and then.	CHITCHAT
Like we never buy it from Target, I just couldn't find it anywhere else and then.	CHITCHAT

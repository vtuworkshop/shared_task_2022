That's too much work.	CHITCHAT
It's like a whole team of people I didn't know about.	CHITCHAT

Unpackage them and stuff and make it look nice.	CHITCHAT
And then they would get their pictures taken and then they would go get repackaged and put back in the warehouse so.	CHITCHAT
It was very repetitive and I had a lot of time to listen to podcasts like I listen to all of the adventure zone.	CHITCHAT

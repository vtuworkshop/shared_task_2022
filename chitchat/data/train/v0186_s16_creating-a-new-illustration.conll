Um?	CHITCHAT
Kind of help me make some decisions.	CHITCHAT
Unlike what I wanted to do.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of a racing out some of these, like random little lines and making sure.	O
The shape is.	O
Kinda how I want it to be.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
One of you.	O
It.	CHITCHAT
Z.	O
I'm dreading drawing this bike.	O
What have I done?	O
Like having a bike in the drawing with like one of the first things I thought I think.	O
This would be cute, but I didn't think about the fact that I had to draw the bike.	O
I think the last time I drew a bike was actually, uhm, when I want to ringling for the pre college.	CHITCHAT
So we had to do a little like.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I think in class where you like.	CHITCHAT
We had, like you know, 15 minutes draw bike and then you had like 10 minutes 5 minutes.	CHITCHAT
One minute.	CHITCHAT
30 seconds, 10 seconds.	CHITCHAT
You had to like.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Trying to figure out like what was the most important thing.	CHITCHAT
To include.	CHITCHAT
Just made her hand look a lot worse.	O
It's like a crab claw.	O
See.	O
But yeah, I think like an exercise like that is like a good way to practice simplification and.	O
Trying to learn like what's the most important thing to include?	O
Never come back.	O
And I keep doing this.	O
Um, how long have I been in illustrator?	CHITCHAT
Um, I've been doing this full time since November 2018.	CHITCHAT
So like a year and a half or so.	CHITCHAT
Yes, a little bit more than that now.	CHITCHAT
But I mean I've been drawing like forever.	CHITCHAT
So if you can, 'cause I had like notebooks and stuff.	CHITCHAT
I think I had to start the notebook for school actually, but it ended up being my my little Journal that I would draw in and I would draw like you know what I did that day or whatever, and.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I called up my life Journal so.	CHITCHAT
My life as a 7 year old.	CHITCHAT
Yes, 6 six or Seven.	CHITCHAT
It was six and Seven actually.	CHITCHAT
But I still have all that stuff like it's all myself back there.	CHITCHAT
I keep all my sketchbooks and everything, um.	CHITCHAT
And they are like pretty funny to look back at it because.	CHITCHAT
You know that that sketchbook, in particular, I mean, I guess it wasn't really a sketch book, but it was a notebook.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I would take it to my babysitters house and.	CHITCHAT
You know, I didn't understand that.	CHITCHAT
TV shows came on at like.	CHITCHAT
You know, like on the hour or the 30 minute Mark, and I would like.	CHITCHAT
Try to like keep track like when does the show come on?	CHITCHAT
Like when does the show come on and I write down the schedule on there and I would draw like the characters from TV shows.	CHITCHAT
And stuff since like I got a lot of Rugrats drawings in there and then.	CHITCHAT

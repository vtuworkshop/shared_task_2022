Uhm, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Just stuff that I wrote was just like.	CHITCHAT
Actually, really funny.	CHITCHAT
Feel like that would be a funny video just doing our reading of like what I wrote.	CHITCHAT
And like saying saying it exactly like it's spelled.	CHITCHAT
Like if I sell something like way off.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
Like I remember there was a show.	CHITCHAT
It's called Maggie and the ferocious beast, and I spelled ferocious fro.	CHITCHAT
She's and I thought that was very funny when I read that after I like, found the book after a long time.	CHITCHAT
It was Maggie and the ferocious beast.	CHITCHAT
But Which felt done doing this like.	O
Line clean out things like.	O
Finished her hand uhm?	O
So I think.	O
Yes, will do the bike now.	O
Kinda like blocked it in already.	O
But we have to look at this reference.	O
It doesn't have to be perfect because I.	O
I honestly have no idea what I'm doing with this bike.	O
Like there's let's see, um, I guess there's like little things.	O
Down here, maybe so you can like I don't know.	O
I think there Springs.	O
Its been along time since ever ratified guys.	CHITCHAT
I've ridden a bike I guess.	CHITCHAT
Ace ride bikes all the time, but the last bike that I had.	CHITCHAT
The handlebars would come off, so not great.	CHITCHAT
It's like there is a.	CHITCHAT
I guess there's a screw in the middle and I as I would like, you know, ride the bike and turn the bike.	CHITCHAT
It would like come loose so I have.	CHITCHAT
I've had instances where the handlebars just kind of like went all the way over to the side.	CHITCHAT
I mean, this was like years ago.	CHITCHAT
Like Middle School high school I used to ride bikes a lot in our neighborhood, but I actually do have like a bike rack one time and it was because I was wearing flip flops when I was riding my bike.	CHITCHAT
Um, in my.	CHITCHAT
You know, I was pedaling the bike and My foot like went through my sandal or whatever and.	CHITCHAT
I like, took a tumble and have like a scar on my leg now.	CHITCHAT
From that Play fade in a lot over the years, but it was.	CHITCHAT
It was not good.	CHITCHAT
I think as long as people can tell this is a bike.	CHITCHAT
We're OK, right?	O
It's like that angle of it.	O
This is very strange.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Just trying to like condense the whole shape of the bike like.	O
Into this angle.	O
Sorry if the because here the lawn mower or somebody like mowing the grass across the street.	O
So I have like confusing bike parts down here.	O
I don't know what's going on.	O
Uh, I got peace going up here so we have the handlebars and there's kind of.	O

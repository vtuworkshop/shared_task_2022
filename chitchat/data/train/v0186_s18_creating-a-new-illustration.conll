OK.	CHITCHAT
And then I know this bike doesn't have a.	O
Back it up.	O
I tried to kind of sketch in a basket.	O
I'm trying to figure out the whole angle of the things.	O
Uhm, I pinned a few different.	O
Bikes like with baskets on here.	O
I like this basket.	O
I think that's cute but I gotta figure out how to.	O
How to think about that from?	O
The opposite.	O
Side So it's kind of it's going away from us, probably at this angle maybe.	O
Something like that.	O
Don't be a little bit wider is going to hold all these little oranges in here.	O
Tell me something like that.	O
You know it's OK, um?	O
Do you use Photoshop or illustrator?	O
I'm using photo shop.	O
I have tried to use illustrator an I'm not very good at it.	O
Photo shop just makes more sense to me I guess.	O
'cause I've been using it for a long time.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
All we got.	CHITCHAT
We got quite a few people in here right now.	CHITCHAT

Anybody from Instagram or.	CHITCHAT
Did you get like a Behance notification?	CHITCHAT
I try my best to let people know.	CHITCHAT
Like on Instagram it sometimes I'm just like stream now.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, people don't get enough time to think about it, really.	CHITCHAT
I'm like I don't have enough time to think like when am I gonna stream?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
Cortana.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So in the bike is a little messy, but it's OK.	O
Um will just paint on top of it.	O
Actually doesn't look too bad without the lines, so.	O
I say that is a success.	O
Especially since the first bike of drawn in years.	O
I have no idea what I'm doing.	O
Anyways.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So this little sketch I guess had the horizon lines are like an estimate of the horizon line.	O
So kind of keep that in here.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So I think what we should do before we.	O
Now I'll go ahead and block in her silhouette and will keep.	O
The bike lines on a separate layer.	O
But, uh, most group these together.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm just going to pick any color really, so I think I'll go with an orange color for now, just so it's nice and bright and we can see it.	O
How bad does it smell with those, um?	CHITCHAT

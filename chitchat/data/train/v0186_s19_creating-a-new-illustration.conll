I actually like to sell oranges, so I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I feel like.	CHITCHAT
Well, they're probably not real oranges.	CHITCHAT
If they're just earrings, but if they were real, they would probably go bad and they would start to smell.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But Oh well 8:30 that's nice.	CHITCHAT
It's like.	CHITCHAT
Noon like to 30 here.	CHITCHAT
Oh play very bright outside.	CHITCHAT
I usually turn off my light.	CHITCHAT
But Did not do that today.	CHITCHAT
We also have my puppies in here and they are actually snuggling today.	CHITCHAT
Normally morally, my older dog, just like, leave me alone.	CHITCHAT
He doesn't like to be bothered by.	CHITCHAT
Uh, the small boy.	CHITCHAT
Which is actually what we call him names Oakley, but.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to take a brush that I want to use.	O
To fill this in, probably do this one.	O
Um, alright.	CHITCHAT
So we're just going to block in trying to ignore the bike for now, but we're going to block in her silhouette.	O
Actually, uhm, I'm going to use a more solid brush.	O
I'm gonna turn off the pen pressure and.	O
Make sure we fill this in completely.	O
Yes, it's a little bit different with her hair 'cause I want to have the same texture as I have in the other one, so we're just going to basically block this out, but we're not going to go all the way to the edges.	O
And just get like that shape in there and then we'll do texture later.	O
Also not sure about this.	O
do I want that?	CHITCHAT
do I not want it?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kind of.	O
See how it goes.	O
I was kind of doing like the outline right now.	O
So I'll just go ahead and I'll use the fill tool to.	O
Come in and finish this up.	O
So I felt this in and I'm going to go ahead and hide, forgot her hand.	O
In this country.	O
All right, so we're going to hide our lines.	O
And we're going to come.	O
Fill this completely in so when we filled it up we have these little lines from the brush still, but I could probably change the fill setting and fix it, but I don't know what to change it to, so this is just how I normally do things.	O
So I want this to be completely solid, so whenever we go in and color it.	O
It will be, um.	O
Like easier to color, like the color with clipping masks.	O
Rather than.	O
You know, just doing everything on one layer.	O
I'll clip it all down to the silhouette.	O
Where and um.	O

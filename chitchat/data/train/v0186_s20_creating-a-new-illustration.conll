If you had any of these white lines in here where I didn't get filled in all the way, then you wouldn't be able to color in that area.	O
On your clipping mask so.	O
Uhm, I said it's pretty good.	CHITCHAT
So well.	CHITCHAT
I can still do the same thing to the bike up.	O
It's like partially in front of her and partially behind her so.	O
Draw a bicycle.	O
Brain games is that on that, like a YouTube video.	O
Like if I were to draw bike without a reference.	O
This is what it would look like.	O
I don't know.	O
It's my first.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We'll No, I don't want to use black.	O
I want to use Grey too intense, uhm?	O
Would be like, here's a wheel here so we'll.	O
There's gotta be something connecting the wheel.	O
Here's a handlebar.	O
I think it goes this way.	O
Does it go this way?	O
I don't know.	O
Seat.	O
Here's my bike.	O
Can you tell it the bike?	O
It looks like somebody trying to draw bike.	O
And Pictionary or something?	O
Yeah, I don't.	O
I don't really draw like.	O
Vehicle forgotten bike is a vehicle kind of, uhm.	O
I don't like drawing cars either.	O
I think last time on the stream we talked about that too.	O
It's rough.	O
Turn on car.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to change her.	O
Oh, that's the like.	O
Her line to this dark red.	O
But I was talking about before, uhm.	O
Just like a burgundy kind of color.	O
Thanks also I'm just going to go in and you know adjust.	O
This silhouette layer here in a little bit, but we're going to leave it like this for now because I want it to be.	O
I want to stand out quite a bit whenever I'm going to try to draw in the background a little bit.	O
Oh, it's a show on YouTube, OK?	CHITCHAT
Keep moving the icons to the bottom of the wrong screen.	O
Alright, so let's see bicycle.	O
I'm going to change these lines as well.	O
Maybe not to the wrong one.	O
And to do this I'm just using.	O
Color balance.	O
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Now make a new layer and will do so.	O
Wet here in a different color.	O
I want to bite to be yellow I think, but.	O
This is not the yellow we're going to think.	O
I'm just going to.	O
Lock it in.	O
With this color.	O
'cause I saw the spike.	O
Closeout my Pinterest Tab.	O
I did bring it, uhm?	O
I saw this bike.	O
It was like a pastel yellow.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Is really pretty.	CHITCHAT
I think I pinned it, but we're going to do a yellow bike.	O
If I can find it.	O
Uh, yellow bike?	CHITCHAT
Where are you?	CHITCHAT
It is I love it so pretty.	CHITCHAT
If I got a bike it would look like this, but I don't have anywhere to ride a bike, so here we are.	CHITCHAT
I like this site.	O
Very cute.	CHITCHAT
So we're just going to block in.	O
Actually do like this color too.	O
I'm like a big fan of this mustard yellow.	O
And we're just going to block this in right now, and I'm going to ignore those little spokes on the wheel.	O

Uhm, this is though.	O
I don't remember what the bike looks like going to go back to my original reference.	O
I think there's like a line right here that I missed whenever I was drawing.	O
There's gotta be something connecting the bike.	O
The back wheel right?	O
Excited, not draw that.	O
Um, I'm using photo shop by the way.	O
Oh, drawing a bite from memory.	O
Yeah, that's difficult.	O
Um, let's see where this bike to just pulled up.	O
So it looks like this part of the bike is connected from the back.	O
For feet and somehow?	O
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Bikes are hard guys there so complicated.	O
We're trying our best.	O
Oh so, uhm.	CHITCHAT
I guess I should probably move her line layer up here since.	O
The bike is kind of overlapping.	O
Her silhouette a little bit and then it's also like going behind her silhouette.	O
So I think.	O
Yeah, like I could just do this and it would go on top of this and I don't want that.	O
So keeping the lines on top and then.	O
Trying to stay.	O
Away from the silhouette.	O
Can make things a little bit easier.	O
Here.	O
I think once we get some different colors going.	O
On this bike, I think it'll start to look more like a bike.	O
OK, now go back.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
OK, I see that's fine.	CHITCHAT
This is OK.	O
OK for now and we can go back and fix it here in a little bit.	O
So we have our silhouettes blocked out for our two main.	O
Like subjects, and now I'm going to.	O
Um, very loosely try to block in some kind of a background so.	O
Rather than working like.	O
Now super precise with little lines were going to work with a bigger brush and try to block out shapes.	O
Which one do I want to use?	O
I do not know.	O
Through I think I'm gonna use.	O
This flat painting brush it's got like.	O
Really broad strokes, so I can just kind of come in and do this, so I'm trying to like visualize what I want this to look like.	O
Um, as far as the background.	O
So I think what I'll do instead of having a white background here, I'm going to.	O
Tone it too.	O
Gray first no.	O
No, we lost her.	O
Sketch.	O
Where does it go?	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to take our big brush and, um?	O
Kind of try.	O
Trying to find like shapes that I like, so I want to have like some kind of like hint of a tree here, even if it's like hidden by some stuff like I want there to be.	O
Like Um?	CHITCHAT
A tree trunk here and then, um.	O
I like having kind of like.	O
Elements appear like hanging over.	O

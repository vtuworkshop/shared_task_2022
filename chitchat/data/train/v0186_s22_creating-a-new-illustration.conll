The top of the illustration come, it's like, Oh yeah, there's.	O
There's trees up there and there's it's kind of like blocking stuff in.	O
My best.	O
So we're mainly like thinking about shape right now and so.	O
This is kind of how I usually do my background just because I'm like I had don't know what I'm doing really.	O
Just kind of like putting stuff in and I also like.	O
I don't want to have it.	O
I don't want that Rita like interfere with this shape of her hair, so I think I'm just going to going to bring this up a little bit more.	O
Like it can be like up here, I think, but this like.	O
Highline right here, we want to have some like.	O
Negative space, so it draws your focus to her eyes.	O
'cause like.	O
If this is all blocked in, I feel like.	O
It wouldn't be as effective.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kind of like, you know, adding, racing, adding and everything.	O
A bunch of different stuff.	O
But it's all about the shape right now.	O
I might even wanna.	O
Bring this up a little bit more.	O
'cause I don't want it to look like she's like at all of the tree.	O
'cause I feel like that's what it was kind of looking like right here.	O
Maybe I don't know.	O
I take that away.	O
It's like tree trunk is gone now.	O
Maybe I could have one like further in the background.	O
But I feel like if you're doing like character illustration and you want to add a background, your background should like compliment the character and help with the composition.	O
Now.	O
It's like it's framing her.	O
You know, these leaves are kind of creating this nice shape.	O
Come out here.	O
We also want to think about, you know.	O
So this tree is above her, kind of like.	O
Coming down here.	O
And then.	O
I don't know, I just have some kind of like.	O
Shrub or something over here I don't know, but we're going to go.	O
Underneath this layer.	O
'cause this would probably closest to us.	O
And then we're going to think about like.	O
Some.	O
More stuff that would be in the background.	O
I should probably lighten this color up a little bit.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I have like a tree reference over here, um.	O
But I don't know.	O
It's kind of thinking that I wanted to see more of the Sky in here.	O
Just thought her sure how I want to do that exactly.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we should think about.	O
So OK.	O
She's walking down.	O
A path an Orchard.	O
So it's going this way.	O
And you like this part that I'm doing right now.	O
Like you do not have to be precise whatsoever, just kind of go for it.	O
Like even like some random lines that you do sometimes they will help you like find what you're looking for.	O
I'm just trying to trying to find that we want to find those shapes and stuff.	O
So that like what I did just then like this is creating depth.	O
It's like there's a tree back there in the background.	O
Thank you further back, like it might not make complete sense, like um perspective Wise right now, but we can.	O

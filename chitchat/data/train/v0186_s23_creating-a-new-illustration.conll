Can try to figure that out.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like perspective, I don't, I don't think is my.	O
My strong suit like I don't.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Completely understand.	O
It all the time.	O
I'm just trying my best, but I think that's like perspective is definitely something I need to work on.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like perspective in regards to like characters, I feel like.	O
I'm like getting it more like how I was talking about earlier, like her arm, kind of like going back into space right here.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But No.	O
As far as like environments, I'm not very.	O
Well versed in environments.	O
Just trying my best.	O
OK, so I feel like this is going somewhere maybe.	O
Oh no.	CHITCHAT
Just playing around with these shapes and stuff, it's kind of like.	O
Um made me see.	O
I kind of where I want this to go.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I'm I'm drawing like these trees in the background like she's like in an Orchard.	O
Um, she has like oranges center basket.	O
And I'm just trying to like find.	O
These shapes and like you know, even just moving it up like that, I feel like.	O
This makes more sense to me like that just looks right for some reason.	O
So we're just trying to block this stuff in like in the for the background.	O
And find something that works like compositionally.	O
So like having the trees kind of like frame.	O
I think works better.	O
You seen sometimes you just need some like breathing room like.	O
You don't want to have everything just like crammed in there like in the background.	O
Um, so if you have like some Sky up here.	O
Or even some like you know when the trees are like further back.	O
Though um, will get lighter.	O
So I think that'll that'll work as well.	O
So just be like.	O
Me doing this is.	O
Just me trying to figure out like shape.	O
So it's probably like confusing, like looking at it.	O
But it will make more sense once I.	O
I'm going here and.	O
Oh please, let me go back.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, it's like.	CHITCHAT
It's just me trying to figure it out, you know?	O
And then I'll I'll make it make more sense.	O
Here in a minute.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So I don't think we need this.	O
This little light green lines anymore.	O
So we can just hide those.	O
And then I'll.	O
Boy profile along that.	O
Probably some kind of like dappled lighting on top, and.	O
Make it look more interesting.	O
Alright, so.	O
I'm going to change the background color too.	O
The Sky color that I want.	O
Do more of A.	O
I don't know if this is it, but.	O
The Sky liner at the top or the bottom, I don't remember.	O

And set it to clipping mask.	O
So if you hold option and click in between the layers on Mac.	O
Then it will create you you're clipping mask or you can always you know right click and.	O
It says release clipping mask, but it'll say like clipping mask.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, um JII agree.	O
Uhm I do have like a pose reference but like I didn't draw the same person or the same outfit or like anything it was just to get like.	O
Opposed that made more sense.	O
Uhm, but once I like like I usually do a study of the pose.	O
OK, so have that down here somewhere.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	O
I don't want to mess with my layers right now, but I'll do like a study of the pozan more of like realistic proportions, and then I will like draw it again and try to make it a little bit more stylized.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
On this, like.	CHITCHAT
You see how we?	O
Last, these really light sketch lines in here from like the first.	O
Layer.	O
Or like on the first path of the sketch and then you know I did the darker ones on top.	O
I feel like that creates like a really nice.	O
Um, like underpainting kind of thing.	O
Like I used to do.	O
Oil painting in college and.	O
We would do um, kind of like a wash underneath of the painting.	O
Before we actually started, and I mean, this is not exactly the same thing, but it's like.	O
I kind of the same same concept because we've got this kind of purple tone in here and I really like that like I have that over here and in the shadows.	O
It's not as like like this is wider, but it's like a good starting point.	O
I feel like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Does little little things, like little subtleties like sometimes you can leave stuff like that in there and it gives your drawings little bit more life.	O
Or painting with.	O
I guess we're using color and stuff, but.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Did you use your illustration for awareness?	O
Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Not necessarily a like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I guess it wasn't really like the intention to begin with, Because I already had this illustration planned out.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Before.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Protesting stuff started happening, but it is a good.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It's good to like have representation like.	O
And your characters and stuff like draw a variety of people.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
From even though that wasn't like.	O
The intention to start out with it's like it's good to show diversity in your character designs.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I like that outfit too.	CHITCHAT
I wish I had this outfit, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Then like wanting to get more clothes and stuff, but it was like I haven't gone shopping in so long 'cause like Covid and stuff and.	CHITCHAT
It's a.	CHITCHAT
Like I want some more summer clothes, but I mean it's like I'm not even going anywhere so it doesn't matter.	CHITCHAT
I guess I could wear different outfits on the stream 'cause I like.	CHITCHAT
I always wear this like.	CHITCHAT
Card again.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
No, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Muncie, so you want I guess.	CHITCHAT

For her shorts, I think I'll do like a light wash jeans short uhm, and you know you don't want to make your shorts like this color blue.	O
Uh, I think, uh, when you're doing like a blue Jean material.	O
Like more of a grey blue, uh is a good place to start.	O
Kind of like the background where I did, but for these shorts, what I will do is I don't know if I'm 100% happy with this color right now, but um.	O
We will come in here and.	O
Create like an Alpha lock.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Or is it called a?	O
Take the lock, I don't remember.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I will, um?	CHITCHAT
We use like a textured brush and create like a blue Jean material.	O
On here.	O
Like a blue Jean texture I guess.	O
So I do like this color actually.	O
Maybe I'll.	O
Saturated a little bit.	O
There we go.	O
Uhm, I definitely prefer Photoshop to illustrator 'cause I don't know how to use illustrator.	O
I'm not very good at it.	O
Uhm, so will lock these pixels and then I'm going to pick up this color again and I'm going to.	O
Lighten it up and I'm going to pick a.	O
Textured brush and I think we'll go with.	O
Will go with the.	O
Sharp render brush anjing sketches.	O
Brush Pack I know we're just gonna lightly.	O
A brush up here.	O
Because really this part down here, uhm.	O
Oh I, I have answered that question like a couple times on the stream so far.	O
I don't know, maybe I didn't talk loud enough or something.	O
Uhm, but since the these jeans right here since our cutoff like.	O
They're like frayed at the bottom.	O
You see, like those lighter fabrics in there, um?	O
I think this like.	O
This brush creates a really nice texture like, especially for jeans.	O
I also go in.	O
And I'll add a darker color.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I'll keep that like Gray blue tone.	O
To kind of make some like.	O
Death and adds more texture in here.	O
And then whenever I go in and I will color the lines, I will come.	O
Think about like this stitching and like the color of the stitches and stuff in here so.	O
We're not going to worry about that right now.	O
Trying to get some base colors down.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh Hi Nikki.	CHITCHAT
Oh I yeah.	CHITCHAT
I mean maybe it was lagging or something.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe it was on my end.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
But thanks for joining the stream.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Sounds like we can go outside.	CHITCHAT
Oakley is ringing his Bell.	CHITCHAT
We have like Jingle Bells on the door.	CHITCHAT
I think my husband letting him out but.	CHITCHAT
We have these little Jingle Bells on our door and that's how we like potty trained Oakley like playing the values go outside.	CHITCHAT
And he's pretty good with that actually.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's like a ton of stuff that you can do in photo shop.	O

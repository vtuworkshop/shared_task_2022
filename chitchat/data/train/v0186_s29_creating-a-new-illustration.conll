Coming here and erase some of this 'cause.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
This line is like bothering me.	O
Even though.	O
Well, actually no.	O
I'm not going to do that right now since I'm going to color it anyways.	O
It really doesn't matter, it's OK.	O
Thank you Mallory.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I agree.	CHITCHAT
I have these brushes for both Photoshop Impropriate so they are like pretty much like the only brushes I used to have like tried different brushes and stuff and.	O
I don't know, they just don't have that same the same feel to them as these do feel like the.	O
Especially like the sketching brushes.	O
Like there so good like I love the sketch sketch square brush.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Do a little.	O
It's got like such like a nice like.	O
Pen pressure to it.	O
And it's also got like a little texture.	O
So like I do pretty much all my sketches with it now.	O
I'll either use this one or I'll use the.	O
The flat square brush.	O
So if I'm doing awesome, like rougher sketches like you can like make this brush pretty small and then.	O
Get some nice like.	O
Sketch lines in there.	O
Very nice.	O
And it's great that it's for photo shop and appropriate.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
Before I would pretty much just to use my handy dandy chalk brush.	O
But I don't know I tried.	O
I'm trying to get more like texture in my work.	O
So using different brushes like definitely helps with that.	O
Finally found their work in his toes.	O
Well, it's like I do.	O
Here, and I'm going to pick from.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Or You think I was using?	O
Edge control smooth I believe so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So we're just going to kind of pick from the color over here.	O
Just add a little bit of variation.	O
And her skin tone.	O
Little bit of shadow.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	O
I think we need to reduce the flow a little bit and Opacity.	O
For like a more subtle.	O
In fact.	O
I think we definitely need to.	O
Change the line color soon because I keep running into like I want to color down here and it's like underneath.	O
The lines sound.	O
I really like what I'm doing right now, it's like.	O

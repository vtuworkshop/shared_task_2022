Not really adding like precise shadows like I will be doing later, I'm just mainly just trying to get some like variation in tone.	O
Uhm, I don't want it to be like flat.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Like I want to have some like different colors in there and like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
That was my friend pressure.	O
I think I did.	O
And assigned to be a little bit more lively.	O
I feel like if you leave it like a flat tone.	O
It's just kind of like loses some of that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But Changing the line color is definitely helpful, so we're going to just go ahead and do that right now since it's like.	O
It's like just taking away.	O
Like Yes, you can see the colors that I want better and then if you add these lines like in here on our hair, it's like what color is this supposed to be?	O
I don't know there's a bunch of like Reds and pinks in there and it's just because I haven't added any clipping masks on top of these lines.	O
So I'm just going to like pick.	O
The darkest color.	O
That I laid down previously in this illustration and.	O
Siri stop.	O
I like annoys me so much.	O
I forgot how I do it, but I always do it on accident, I'm like.	O
I'm like Hey Siri like.	O
Can you please stop and she's like I can't do that?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Whatever.	CHITCHAT
But she wouldn't.	O
Maybe there is a way to like disable it, but it's like I never use it on my computer ever.	O
And forget that it exists, and so I do that on accident.	O
So it's like this, like that's already looking better.	O
So the evening out.	O
The.	O
Or like.	O
I guess making everything look more cohesive.	O
Maybe it's the better.	O
Word.	O
And since I have a Sonic clipping mask, I can change this color 'cause I think maybe we might need to go a little bit darker to have bright contrast in between like her hair color and like the hair color line or the Hairlines.	O
'cause we want to be able to see like the curls and everything in here.	O
Which you know I will go and come.	O
I will go and color on top of this here a little bit.	O
But We just want a good base or we can pick colors from.	O
Kind of what we're doing now.	O
We're going to pick from the lines as well as like the colors in the background that I chose.	O
Hum, but I think once.	O
I think what will do is will finish at.	O
Coloring her for the most part, 'cause I'll probably stop streaming around.	O
215 two thirtyish because I want to be able to eat lunch and.	O
Watched the new YouTube video premiere with you guys.	O
Well, not necessarily.	O
Watch it for me.	O
I'll just be chatting 'cause I've like editing videos on like I don't ever want to hear myself talk again.	O

Um?	CHITCHAT
It's rough, especially like telling my.	O
Story and stuff.	O
Like about why I started art, just feel like I'm talking about myself too much and I don't want to.	O
I don't want to hear it anymore.	O
But I think it is something like.	O
You know, like I find that listening to.	O
Other artists talk about, you know how they started, like that was something that really helped me so.	O
And I know you guys like a lot of people have been asking for a video like that for me so.	O
I think it is actually going to be helpful for people even though I don't like to hear myself talk about it.	O
I don't want to sound like.	O
I don't know.	O
I don't like to talk about myself too much 'cause it doesn't.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Like Not humble.	O
I don't want to be that way.	O
But if it's, I guess in this instance little bit different.	O
Coming to help people, or that's the goal anyways is to help people.	O
Was there are journey by telling my our journey?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm so hungry and you figure out what to eat too.	CHITCHAT
I'm making soup tonight.	CHITCHAT
Probably shouldn't have a sandwich.	CHITCHAT
'cause that's what I'll eat the soup.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll make a city or something.	CHITCHAT
Sounds pretty good.	CHITCHAT
I got this like.	CHITCHAT
Street Taco soft stuff.	CHITCHAT
It's like a Verde sauce.	CHITCHAT
It's very good.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what the brand is, but it's like.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit spicy, but it's not too spicy.	CHITCHAT
Um so.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I've had it for a long time I mean it's not expired or anything, but I had it for awhile and I.	CHITCHAT
I made like shrimp tacos at home and I ended up not being very goods.	CHITCHAT
I didn't use this off anymore, but it wasn't like because of the sauce I just like.	CHITCHAT
Never thought to put it on.	CHITCHAT
Oh, like a normal like Quesadillas.	CHITCHAT
I would usually make an dumb.	CHITCHAT
I just started using it again.	CHITCHAT
I was like Oh my gosh, this is very good.	CHITCHAT
I wish I could remember the name of it though.	CHITCHAT
No idea could not even guess.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Something that I will also do sometimes to like clean up some of the lines that I don't wanna hear anymore.	O
I'll just pick the color from like the background and.	O
Use it.	O
For some of these.	O
Like just cleaning up, you know around her chin right here.	O
There's a few little straight lines that I've.	O
I don't think are necessary, just picked from the background.	O
Okie dokie I think she's looking cute.	O
I like how her face turned out.	O
Um, so we.	CHITCHAT
Where is the light gonna be coming from?	O

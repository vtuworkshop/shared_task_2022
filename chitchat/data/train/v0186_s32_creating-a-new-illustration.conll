I think we'll do some.	O
Just some light from above.	O
Um, or maybe like this kind of diagonal away.	O
That will determine where this little.	O
Little spot right here will go.	O
And then add some color back in here.	O
Got like a A Haseley.	O
Brown but like tinted green.	O
I need to lower my opacity on this one.	O
Looks like the color.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
It'll be the brightest on the other side.	O
Of the little highlight.	O
I think that's just the way, uhm?	O
Like your eyes, since they're shaped like this and like your.	O
Your iris and.	O
People like it curves out, um, more it.	O
Like online goes through it, it'll hit the opposite side and be the brightest over there.	O
So I mean, I know some.	O
Some people will draw.	O
There's like all the way around.	O
Kind of thing, but.	O
I prefer just kind of having mine.	O
The color of the eyes kind of come down here and do like a fade.	O
From the darkest part.	O
Just kind of how I do it.	O
Yeah, it's like a nice effect.	O
Uhm and then see.	CHITCHAT
I think I had a little bit of a darker tone in here too.	O
Sounds like a gradient.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But it's going good.	O
I like it so far.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Well, I think what I'm going to do for these orange earrings is kind of trim up the shape of them.	O
With this This line right here and then we'll just color on top of it later.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
If you like.	O
I extended the the wine work a little bit further than I wanted to anyways.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Do you like down here?	O
I don't like how that works.	O
I'm just going to kind of clean this up.	O
Using the color from the hair.	O
And then, um.	O
Can I do the same thing right here?	O
Actually might bring her hair down a little bit here.	O
I think I think it should probably come forward down here more.	O
Uhm, but that's something we have to do on a different layer because we can't do it right now.	O
I'm sorry guys.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Can I go ahead and change the color of her shirt lines?	O
So we picked a Peach color last time.	O
And I don't have the opacity turned all the way up on this fresh.	O
So we're kind of getting this.	O
Like dark red to pop through.	O
Which isn't actually such a bad thing.	O

Probably jump off here so I can eat lunch.	CHITCHAT
But well, I'll get back on the stream.	CHITCHAT
Um on Monday and work on this.	CHITCHAT
Since it I need to get it finished pretty soon.	CHITCHAT
But I think we definitely made some good progress today, that's for sure.	CHITCHAT
Happy with where it's going and I'm excited to see.	CHITCHAT
Everything come together specially like with the background and stuff from.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think.	CHITCHAT
I like the color palette and stuff, um.	O
So we pretty much have all of our lines colored on our character.	O
I do need an.	O
Her little Flowers in her hair.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
If you need my glasses on, I think that makes me tired.	CHITCHAT
Like if I stare at my screen too long and I don't have my glasses on.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I don't necessarily like need them, but.	CHITCHAT
It's like.	CHITCHAT
I I guess I have like a stigmatism.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but my vision.	CHITCHAT
I think it's like a negative like .25 and one eye and the other ones like fine.	CHITCHAT
It's just the stigmatism makes it hard to read.	CHITCHAT
On screen.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Um, maybe that makes like.	CHITCHAT
My eyes tired or something I don't know.	CHITCHAT
The bug.	CHITCHAT
So like not like walking on my desk in front of me.	CHITCHAT
Sing Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I mean these glasses have a blue light filter and.	CHITCHAT
Um, it probably don't use them as much as I should.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm on the computer like all the time.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think it would be better for my eyes if I did use of the glasses more, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Oh See I don't wear them enough to to know that.	CHITCHAT
Which is bad, but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's just like I'm not used to wearing them, and since it's got like the weird curve on the lens for the stigmatism, like if I move my head it's like distorts my vision and I'm like Oh no I get dizzy like I can't.	CHITCHAT
I can't walk around with them on.	CHITCHAT
Like I I like the the look of them.	CHITCHAT
I think they look cute and then like I wear him out and I'm like Oh my gosh I can't.	CHITCHAT
I can't do this anymore.	CHITCHAT
But even just like moving my head back and forth like looking at my tablet, I'm just like who I can't take this.	CHITCHAT
I think it might be a little bit different, like from just looking at my computer and like.	CHITCHAT
I don't like making patrion stuff, but.	CHITCHAT
Trying to Look at my tablet.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit rough.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going back and forth between the two like monitors as well.	CHITCHAT
Full challenging Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I need to play Animal Crossing Nikki 'cause it's like the swimming thing like yes I've been waiting for that.	CHITCHAT
Um and there are so many bugs and stuff like bugs and fish that I missed in them in June and I think I'm just gonna go back a couple days and get those and then play if I have time I have a lot of stuff to do this weekend so all stuff that I need to get done this week but the videos took a long time and.

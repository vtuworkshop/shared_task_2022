The lines on the bike trying to make that look a little poke.	O
I unclipped the wrong thing.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Mike ones are up here.	O
Cycle, why did that happen?	CHITCHAT
Hello please did you party?	CHITCHAT
He was found.	CHITCHAT
He said.	CHITCHAT
Ugly.	CHITCHAT
Messy hello.	CHITCHAT
Do you wanna say hello?	CHITCHAT
If he wants to come up here.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I know.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Finger in.	CHITCHAT
Teen in Chrome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah well look how big he is.	CHITCHAT
He got so big.	CHITCHAT
Big boy, aren't you?	CHITCHAT
He gets his first haircut like next week.	CHITCHAT
I've been like cutting his hair, um.	CHITCHAT
Oh As best as I can so.	CHITCHAT
He looks a little rough.	CHITCHAT
But we're gonna have to help him with his little Matt.	CHITCHAT
Please.	CHITCHAT
He's becoming a good boy.	CHITCHAT
He's just a baby still.	CHITCHAT
Marley's down there too, but he's a happy boy.	CHITCHAT
I will not be picking him up right now.	CHITCHAT
PM I'd like a couple weeks ago I think.	CHITCHAT
Whatever we blast of us came out, I hurt my arm like when I was sleeping.	CHITCHAT
And Uhm.	CHITCHAT
It's like I slept on it like like this and I like couldn't lift up my Arm 'cause I hurt that.	CHITCHAT
I think it was the tendon or the OR your bicep connects.	CHITCHAT
And that was like extremely painful.	CHITCHAT
I don't ever want that to happen again.	CHITCHAT
But I'm always like I said, completely gone.	CHITCHAT
Or am I going to pick up Marley again, hurt my arm?	CHITCHAT
Because when it was like healing and like it hadn't heard the entire day, I picked him up and then.	CHITCHAT
Found out that.	CHITCHAT
Not a good idea.	CHITCHAT
That hurt my arm.	CHITCHAT
But Um?	CHITCHAT
I thank you, um, yeah I'm I've been streaming on here for a little bit, so uhm, I think if you follow me you get notifications on here.	CHITCHAT
So I try to I try my best to like tell everybody when I'm streaming on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
But like it's just better if.	CHITCHAT
You get a direct notification here.	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
The spike kind of makes sense I guess.	O
Coming along.	O
I guess this is not attached to the wheel, so we probably shouldn't make it look like it is.	O

Hustle better, so kind of like this and then, um.	O
Have Place similar color to her belt.	O
Oh no, I was wrong.	O
It's not what I want.	O
Uh, well it will leave this in here and then you want it to be.	O
Less orange, more.	O
More of a.	O
It's kind of a yellow E, not that much.	O
Kind of like that maybe?	O
Link on my monitor.	O
This is going to be a little bit darker.	O
My tablet is too light.	O
I need to figure out how to adjust that 'cause I can do the contrast and stuff and I think just looking at the photo shop like interface.	O
If I move it back to my computer.	O
Um, like on the tablet?	O
It's a little bit like.	O
Tint of green just slightly, so all my colors gonna get thrown off.	O
Uhm, but.	CHITCHAT
It's OK 'cause I always can go back and fix it on the computer.	O
This is definitely not the.	O
Brown that I'll be using for the tree in the background.	O
I think it might look OK for this.	O
But this tree, since it's like further away.	O
Gonna be.	O
Lighter and.	O
More.	O
I guess.	O
Cooler.	O
Then as far as the actual tree color.	O
What's going on in the background first?	O
So we.	O
Plus saturated I'll probably.	O
Change the shape a little bit of this.	O
Tree as well, kind of like.	O
Like I said earlier, kind of give her some space.	O
Um, like compositionally?	O
We want to have some kind of negative space, so the focus is drawn to her face and we don't want it like a lot of busy lines behind her.	O
Think that'll help.	O
And 1st will add some oranges to the trees later on, but just come out blocking this in right now.	O
As far as you like trees for the background go, I might have to.	O
Take another look at like the placement of everything, so it's just kind of like.	O
The first path to see.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
'cause really the tree.	O
Might be.	O
2.	O
I don't know.	O
It's like I'm not really.	O
I don't know if I'm like in the shape.	O
Sometimes it's best to just kind of like.	O
Leave it as it is and come back to it.	O
Feel like she needs a little bit of space above her head actually.	O
And then probably like.	O

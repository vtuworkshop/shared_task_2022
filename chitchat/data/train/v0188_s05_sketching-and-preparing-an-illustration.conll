Of the dress.	O
Down here, so that's.	O
But you need to pay most attention to and that's what you.	O
Can easily do by simplifying the forms you have.	O
A lot of drawing instructions for beginners have these.	O
Um, things included where they say where they say you supposed to simplify the forms into cubes and cylinders and stuff like that, but I think this isn't really useful until you understand perspective enough to.	O
To apply it on your own.	O
And see what the basic shape of the element is that you are trying to simplify.	O
Hi Sean.	CHITCHAT
And once you have that stage, you can.	O
Whenever you you're not sure what to do.	O
With a certain Element Perspective Wise.	O
Then you can.	O
Try and simplify it yourself to see what the.	O
The current perspective looks like so I can just take this.	O
Right here and just.	O
Make a sudden I like that to make sure I get the right perspective with clothing.	O
Which is in general, you can always try and.	O
Imagine a striped.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Strep kind of suit the that your character was too.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
To simulate the perspective you.	O
I'm going to have to include.	O
And as well.	O
Happy a lot when you are trying to.	O
Set clothing into the right perspective.	O
This.	O
I might give us some stress.	O
Sucks because dogs night.	O
Yes it is.	O
We often tend to just wing it somehow for years, and specially if you come from a comic and manga background, you often used to.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like learning shapes and symbol form instead of.	O
Instead of understanding how these shapes are created in a drawing and why they look like their supposed to look so.	O
I I will never forget, I think.	CHITCHAT
How friend once told me that was over 10 years ago, how she learned to draw an arm from.	CHITCHAT
From a certain spec perspective, in a certain polls.	CHITCHAT
And I was like what you?	CHITCHAT
You don't you don't learn poses perspectives, you learn how an arm looks and then you can just pose and rotate it in your hand.	CHITCHAT
So that's something you should strive for.	CHITCHAT
Understanding the forms and shapes by create.	CHITCHAT
Instead of.	CHITCHAT
Trying to copy a certain shape that you see in another drawing.	CHITCHAT
I mean, if your goal is to to do your own poses and.	O
Pull up your own illustrations at least.	O
I'm still not happy with that plan.	O
Oh funny, one that doesn't understand German.	O
Unfocused set perspective is hard, she's.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
She said that perspective is hard and she's.	O
She's always realizing that when doing drawbacks exercises drop boxes.	O
Drawing training.	O
Thingy website you can use for free.	O
Ali is asking.	CHITCHAT
How do you manage your for shortening without a life model?	O
I'm it is hard he.	O
I would always recommend looking for making your own reference in order to get it right.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
What I like to do is actually.	O
Take.	O
A body part and then just play around with the size and position.	O
For example, if you do just try something out, if I I.	O

If I'm doing like a face.	O
Very nice, very professional.	O
If I'm doing like a phase and then I want to.	O
To make, for example, a hand that's stretched right.	O
And the direction of the viewer.	O
I would recommend too.	O
One thing to broaden your visual library is definitely do dress social studies as much as you can.	O
But another thing is to really just try and and work with.	O
Rough, roughly.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
With roughly sketched shades for the.	O
Parts of the arm and then you can.	O
Always just try an.	O
For the hand, and like very big.	O
Separate layer.	O
Are you pretty?	O
Can always Problem very big hand in the foreground.	O
And then you can come.	O
Always try to.	O
Transformative.	O
You draw digitally and play around with its size to get a really nice dramatic effect.	O
And then if you have a size and you have a position that looks kind of naturally.	O
It's not that much work to just.	O
Connect	O
The pieces with some rough lines as I said to do gesture said studies as much as you can because those will help you with building up the Visual Library of the shapes you want to use here.	O
But once you have that.	O
Very.	O
Good way to indicate the perspective later on with clothing's ready to to include this stuff.	O
The openings and the perspective of the.	O
After clothes and it's themselves.	O
So you don't like.	O
Really nice.	O
Really nice perspective.	O
Hum effect.	O
Too hard, so to speak and write the same time right now.	O
Yep, what an asset.	O
You, the more gesture studies you do, the better your understanding of the bodies forms.	O
Will get.	O
And then you can always just.	O
At like different body parts here.	O
Hold on, don't be sorry.	CHITCHAT
We had to learn together I don't know I hope it helped it.	CHITCHAT
One thing you you got to keep in mind is when you trying to do.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Dynamic illustrations having stuff moving towards the viewer or away from the viewers.	O
Always a great way to.	O
To add more.	O
My life Lena stupor.	O
To the peace.	O
Someone?	O
That's not nice.	O
I don't know what I'm doing here.	O
I'm really I'm really not in my best trying day today, but yet you can.	O
Play around with more perspective.	O
The more you you to studies in different poses, the easier it gets really.	O
But one very.	O
Very important things to keep in mind that things that go towards the viewer are open and things that turn away a close.	O
That way if you do these very rounded very.	O
Encentuate it shapes like this.	O
You get a nice.	O
Effect of things actually moving towards our way.	O
The viewer, yeah.	O
That's very basic stuff, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I hope that helped with it.	CHITCHAT
Alright where we where we?	O
I was going to do some coffee by the way, if you have any ideas how to improve her her clothing or design, let me know because I feel like kind of blank right now.	O

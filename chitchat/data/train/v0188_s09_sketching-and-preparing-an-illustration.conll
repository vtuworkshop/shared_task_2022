Choice, even though you can also use fresco.	O
I didn't test it yet, but.	O
Yes, it's another.	O
That's for creating a true if you're interested in a more technical approach.	O
That includes.	O
Working with paths like.	O
But you basically do a special lines like this.	O
And then stroke it.	O
An you see how?	O
Are you Santa doing this?	O
Right, I didn't want to use the pen, right?	O
I wanted to stroke this thing with the brush.	O
This is what you get.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But you can of course.	O
Two different settings.	O
But this is a.	O
Much more technical approach to that.	O
You would use them.	O
An illustrator.	O
I think you can just go ahead and use the drawing to the like a pencil too, but it's not going to give you the same results because it's.	O
Calculating vectors out of the strokes you do.	O
Hi Tim, thank you.	O
I'm not sure yet, I just started.	O
We will have to see if it turns out good.	O
Yeah, I'm going to finish this match today, I think.	O
And then tomorrow I'm going to stream again.	O
And we'll keep on working on it I guess.	O
Cecily done on Sunday.	O
Need to do something about this tangent?	O
Make sure this.	O
I cannot show what I mean that Angeles went to lands are meeting at a point like here when whether or not actually connected.	O
It's just not visually pleasing because creates a connection where there shouldn't be 1.	O
And everybody's doing it.	O
So you just have to watch out for when it happens and then.	O
Make small correction.	O
Usually there's something you can do about it.	O
I actually use an extra pen screen tablet right now so I can't complain I'm.	O
Of the opinion that way come screen tablets are a bit expensive for what they offer, especially compared to be cheaper once you get right now.	O
And though I think the smaller sentix have gotten a lot cheaper too.	O
So yeah, you can just use an XP penalty young or something like that and be.	O
Be happy with that.	O
The only difference that many people.	O
Talk about is how the.	O
XP Pen is.	O
A lot.	O
Smoother just.	O
Almost feels like I don't know if it is glass or plastic, but it does feel like smooth glass.	O
Anderson takes to have a more rough surface, but you can always just.	O
Buy a screen protector thing.	O
Cover the tasmar paper like texture of you.	O
If that's important to you, I don't mind the smooth surface.	O
For me it works quite well.	O

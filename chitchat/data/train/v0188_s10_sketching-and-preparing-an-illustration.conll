Right, so right now I'm just going to refine the shapes of everything here because I'm.	O
Just looks a bit too convoluted.	O
And this way I'm getting rid of the tangent altogether.	O
But I might need to.	O
To move over the whole line of this.	O
It's.	CHITCHAT
To make it still follow the Daleks, Shaper, right?	O
Seeing this and learning to.	O
To measure how the phones work in 3D is just really a matter of training and.	O
Doing lots of studies and.	O
Perspective exercises.	O
Asinas at drop off this a great resource for that if you're not sure about perspective yet.	O
Do that.	O
No problem.	CHITCHAT
Happy if it helps.	CHITCHAT
As you see, you don't.	CHITCHAT
One thing I see many people.	O
Kind of expecting or believing is that once you are on a certain level, you always nail it right at the start, and that's just not true.	O
You always have to try around a bit, and I mean.	O
There's some people who will put the stuff online and through that process.	O
Videos online.	O
Who who are really just that experienced who can just.	O
Do the stuff without any corrections necessary, but.	O
Like 90% of all professional artists.	O
So need to figure it out.	O
And play around with the shapes of it before they really hit the right ones.	O
So don't expect too much of yourself, I mean.	O
Symbols for working without.	O
Without reference.	O
I used the rough free depots for for my first under sketch.	O
And then I'm experienced enough to workout the details from that.	O
On my own in this simplified style, but many people won't be even if they're if, even if there is lots look very professional because.	O
It's just a matter of of learning it over the years and and solidifying you understanding.	O
What kind of have to figure out what kind of shoes she's going?	O
These are questions I didn't know I had to answer today.	O
That's how prepared I was.	O
If you're wondering.	O
This looks great.	O
Time to to start in a position that is going to give me trouble to.	O

At the same time, moving towards the viewer as it is.	O
Above Yeah, but I think.	O
This should work.	O
I wanted to have some.	O
Spike issues.	O
Spikier No, if you do design stuff like this and an earth like.	O

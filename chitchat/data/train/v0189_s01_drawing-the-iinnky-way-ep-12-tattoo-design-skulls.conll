Come up with too many of your own designs because the clients usually bring in what they want and stuff like that.	O
But there are tattoo artists strive to get clients that want their.	O
Input on the designs and stuff like that, which means you get to do a lot more concept stuff.	O
A lot more stuff that goes along with what you like to do, and that's kind of like on a tattoo ours I am where I have a lot of creativity, though I don't shy away from tattooing anybody that has their own design.	O
I I prefer that people come in with a fresh mind that wants to create something from scratch just simply so that you can broaden your horizon.	O
A lot of people.	O
In tattooing or clients that get tattooed, generally get the same stuff all the time and it's always refreshing when you get somebody that just once to start from the beginning and kind of build off of that.	O
Now like I said This is going to be a full tattoo sleeve.	O
The template that you see behind is a template of a tattoo sleeve.	O
Are a sleeve or an arm.	O
Now it's not to scale, is just, it's just.	O
It's just a guideline.	O
The inner part is what the actual arm would look like.	O
Roughly, the outer part is the overlap or the under part of the arm, because tattoos because it's going to be a full sleeve, it wraps around and a lot of people don't necessarily understand when you.	O
The biggest problem that you usually get is when you do wraparounds or when you do sleeves.	O
People don't understand their sleeves, wrap around.	O
And this is what I mean.	O
what I say people.	O
I mean tattoo artists.	O
They don't necessarily understand that sleeves wrap around and believe it or not, like a lot of tattoo artist don't necessarily have a lot of art experience.	O
They just had to.	O
So if they when they go to to actually design a tattoo for the first time, they get lossed and the main reason why they get losses because they don't understand.	O
How about how the body works?	O
You know, and then, because they've never actually had to draw a tattoo to fit the body.	O
They literally just draw whatever the client puts it brings in.	O
They just stick it on the part of the body and just go.	O
But when you're creating for the body, you know when you're not doing something as pre drawn.	O
You have to start thinking outside the box or you have to start thinking about the composition and the build of your tattoo very differently.	O
Generally I understand two things you actually have to understand when it comes to tax away.	O
That's super important.	O
The first thing is the entire design has to fit in the designated area, meaning if the person wants to tattoo on their arm, your entire design as you come up with literally has to fit the arm.	O
You can't go outside.	O
You know that you know if they want it to fit the arm, you can't.	O
You can extend it anywhere else you know, or it can't be cut off either.	O
That's the biggest thing is like a lot of people when they design.	O
Either design too big and the design gets cut off or to design too small.	O
But they designed it for the paper and then like half of the images like cut off.	O
Just generally where the template comes in a lot of time and a lot of things that a lot of beginning artist that decide to start creating their own designs do.	O
Also is they forget that if you're creating a design.	O
And you're using a template, right?	O
Like the little template you see in the background.	O
The template is a guideline.	O
It's OK if you go outside the lines.	O
Just understand that whatever is outside the lines may or may not be cut off.	O
That's the whole point of the template to give you like a yield or a warning sign like hey, you're getting close to the end or hey, you just hit the end so anything you put in these areas may not end up in the tattoo.	O
But You know that doesn't necessarily mean that it won't end up in the tattoo, and it doesn't necessarily mean you should stop people.	O
Uhm, when you're younger than you are in school and you're doing art and stuff like that.	O
A teacher will.	O
Lot would always tell you.	O
Don't go outside the lines and stuff like that.	O
And then when you get older, you start understanding that going outside the lines is exactly what you want to do because.	O
Creativity doesn't stay within the lines, so I will sell you to think outside the box and stuff like that.	O
So now this particular piece that I'm working on here.	O
Is just this there only reason why I like this piece right here or I'm rather interested in in, uh?	O
It's it's build and I took it on is because.	O

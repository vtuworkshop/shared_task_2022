You see skulls and tattooing all the time, but unfortunately I don't never.	O
I don't ever really get a lot of them.	O
You know, I get a lot of Flowers.	O
I get a lot of the cutesy stuff 'cause believe it or not I get a lot of female are people that come to me for tattoos because of what I draw.	O
A lot of people would look at me and think that I get a lot of mails and I do a lot of like the typical tattoo you would think of male would do I don't do very many male tattoos at all.	O
Most of the tattoos that I do happen to be on females.	O
Which I actually kind of enjoy simply because females in my opinion, in my journey in tattooing females have had the best ideas, you know.	O
Mens tattoos tend to.	O
Be.	O
Easier to do.	O
You know, as far as like.	O
How do I say it?	O
They are easier to do as far as application.	O
You know, because of most most men want black and grey stuff like that.	O
But females tattoos usually tend to be more fun because they have better ideas.	O
You know 'cause women have.	O
They have really big imaginations when it comes to stuff like that and they have really deep emotions.	O
So when they think of a tattoo idea there tattoo idea usually is way deeper.	O
Mens tattoos usually relate to.	O
Something going on within themselves.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Where they're from.	O
Family like they keep.	O
There's in a small spectrum for the most part you know you do you mean like on both ends of the spectrum things go outside the box, but most most of the time for the average person because a lot of people when a lot of people when they design tattoos and a lot of tattoo artists they do this thing that.	O
A lot of people do that.	O
They don't necessarily realize they they put everything in the same realm as them.	O
So if I were to say that.	O
You know, a lot of people like if I were to say that a lot of people come to me with ideas and these ideas are pretty much in a certain range.	O
A lot of people feel like that's not true because they don't think like that, you know, but it's like if I tell you that when you tap when you design tattoos, that most of your tattoos are going to be similar.	O
A lot of people are.	O
They don't want to believe that, and I'm just like, dude, I'm telling you you get a lot of tattoos and a lot of them are similar.	O
You know it's just because a lot of people just can't think outside the box.	O
If the other it's the same thing is when I tell people that men don't sit as well as women when they get tattooed, it's.	O
One of those things that will blow your mind but is true.	O
You know it's just like men don't sit as well as women.	O
I don't know what the case is.	O
Everybody has their scenarios and all of that.	O
It's never what people think it is.	O
You know everybody has their reasoning for why, but no one really knows is just one of those things that just.	O
It is what it is, you know.	O
With That being said.	O
You tend to shift toward one type of tattoo or one type of client.	O
I didn't set out to tattoo, mostly women.	O
You know, I actually didn't set out the tattoo.	O
Anything that females might like just simply because I didn't want to do that kind of work, but.	O
Like as you learn when you get into tattooing like.	O
Life dictates pretty much what you're going to do.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
I got into tattooing and I was like I'm not doing fairies and I'm not doing this and I'm not doing that.	O
And you know, I was all about not doing anything that didn't make me happy, you know, but.	O
Again, what you learn real quick is like.	O
In life.	CHITCHAT
You learn things.	CHITCHAT
And one of the things that you learn is that.	CHITCHAT
You don't necessarily get to pick what you want to do.	CHITCHAT
You pretty much do what.	CHITCHAT
Is thrown in front of you or you get left.	CHITCHAT
You know you just get left out in the cold.	CHITCHAT
For me.	CHITCHAT
I didn't want to do.	CHITCHAT
All of that stuff because in my brain.	CHITCHAT
I was like that's not gonna make me money.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to be happy.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be bored out of my mind.	CHITCHAT
I want to do something that's a little more upbeat, you know, and that's just not going to do it.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
So I shied away from it.	CHITCHAT

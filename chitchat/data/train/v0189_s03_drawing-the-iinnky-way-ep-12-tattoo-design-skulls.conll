It took me not being able to pay rent.	CHITCHAT
For one month.	CHITCHAT
And almost being evicted for me to realize that all of that stuff that I overlooked when I was doing tattooing.	CHITCHAT
Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Was generally the stuff that could have saved me and ask Connor would change my mind about the way that I thought, you know, I was like look, I mean I know I don't want to do these things and it's probably gonna suck.	CHITCHAT
But you know what else sucks?	CHITCHAT
Not being able to pay rent.	CHITCHAT
And that was when I got my head out of the out of the clouds and I started doing whatever came through the door just simply because I need to pay my bills, you know and then and then something hit me that actually woke me up and made me realize something that I should have known a long time ago.	CHITCHAT
But I just never.	CHITCHAT
I never actually gave two too like think about uhm.	CHITCHAT
And one of the things that I that I didn't actually pay attention to that I really should have was.	CHITCHAT
Just because you do tattooing right just because you do a, you know like you want to do a specific type of tattoos.	CHITCHAT
Does not mean.	CHITCHAT
That If somebody comes to you, say someone comes to you and they want a.	CHITCHAT
Fairy right 'cause you know that's a very common tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Believe it or not, it's a very common tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Someone comes to you and they wanna ferry just because they want a fairy doesn't mean you have to do the typical average everyday ferry.	CHITCHAT
And it doesn't mean that the ferry that they want has to be.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, cutesy.	CHITCHAT
And all of that stuff like because you know that was my thing was like I wanted to do.	CHITCHAT
I've always wanted to draw monsters and things like that, but.	CHITCHAT
You know, I never really got the opportunity to sit down and actually, you know, create when I first started tattooing because our when I first started doing art because I was so busy learning.	CHITCHAT
And then once I actually got good I was so excited.	CHITCHAT
I just wanted to make people like my work.	CHITCHAT
So a lot of times when I was doing with things that I.	CHITCHAT
Didn't necessarily care to do, but I knew it got people to look at what I was doing.	CHITCHAT
Later on I will find out that that was probably like the worst thing in the world I could have done because.	CHITCHAT
Like basing your karere.	CHITCHAT
Off of especially in art off of what other people?	CHITCHAT
Think is is the worst way to go about it, and then you learn later on that people generally like whatever you put out.	CHITCHAT
You know the problem is is you.	CHITCHAT
Typically get hungry for attention and you put your focus where you think the most people will see it.	CHITCHAT
Which is generally where the problem comes in, because then you get this.	CHITCHAT
You get this mentality that whatever is popular, you have to do and then you get stuck in that bubble that most tattoo artist get stuck in.	CHITCHAT
Where they start creating things just because they're popular.	CHITCHAT
You know which you should never do, you know, because you get burnt out, you start getting impostor syndrome, you know and all these other things that are kind of related to that situation.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
You have to cut a climb out of that hole, so for me when I was doing my tattoos and I was just kind of like I can't do this stupid, I can't.	CHITCHAT
I'm like I would get really frustrated and a part of my frustration came from the fact that I really just wanted to draw cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
You know my momma in my mind drawing the stuff that I was drawn just wasn't cool and it was really ticking me off 'cause I just really wanted to do cool stuff and I didn't think that anybody would like what I was doing because it's just well in my opinion.	CHITCHAT
It just wasn't cool.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It would bum me out for awhile and then like once I realized that.	CHITCHAT
I was doing this to myself.	CHITCHAT
And that.	CHITCHAT
In order to make better tattoos I can draw.	CHITCHAT
I can pretty much take anybody's idea.	CHITCHAT
They're coming to me with their idea, right?	CHITCHAT
So they're coming to you and they're giving you their idea and they're like, OK, you want I want fairies?	CHITCHAT
And you're like, OK, you don't have to draw the fairies that you don't have to draw the failures that everybody else draws.	CHITCHAT
You can literally draw your own type of fairies.	CHITCHAT
You can make them whatever you want.	CHITCHAT
If they came to you with the idea because they trust you.	CHITCHAT
And that's the biggest thing that I had to learn was like.	CHITCHAT
As soon as the client presents me with an idea they trust me.	CHITCHAT
I can do pretty much whatever I want with the idea because that's why they came to me.	CHITCHAT
They want to see what I can create if they didn't want to see what I could create, they would bring me the design.	CHITCHAT
I don't don't ask me why it took me so long to realize this, so I would just start drawing what I want.	CHITCHAT

It presented to the client and the client would be like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is cool.	CHITCHAT
This is great, let's do it and I'm just like holy crap like this person really just said yes to this really, really weird thing that I did, you know, but I thought was cool.	CHITCHAT
So like if someone were coming to me and draw it come to me with fairy designs I wouldn't do like the cutesy Tinker Bell Fairies I would do like warrior fairies.	CHITCHAT
And come to find out women were chicks.	CHITCHAT
Really dig back.	CHITCHAT
They would be like Oh my God, this is actually really cool, you know?	CHITCHAT
Or if they brought me Flowers and stuff like that I wouldn't draw the tip.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't go in draw.	CHITCHAT
Typical Flowers that you saw on the Internet.	CHITCHAT
I would try to draw him and arrange them in the way that they never seen.	CHITCHAT
I would add things to it that.	CHITCHAT
Normal people don't necessarily add, you know, like I would add elements to the entire drawing that would make it look a lot more.	CHITCHAT
Engaging.	CHITCHAT
It would, it would always bug me that when people drew Flowers they were putting me like life in it.	CHITCHAT
It would just be the Flowers, you know.	CHITCHAT
You could put little things like like ladybugs can put hummingbirds, you know all these little things that make something look like it's, you know, lived in or whatever, and people would go with that.	CHITCHAT
and I know the other thing that I would notice is that a lot of the reason why a lot of people with a lot of clients with shy away from this kind of stuff and be against it is because of money.	CHITCHAT
You know, and that was the other thing that I that I ended up like changing was like the.	CHITCHAT
The idea that.	CHITCHAT
Your tattoo needs.	CHITCHAT
If your tattoo is going to be super good, it is neat.	CHITCHAT
It needs to be super expensive.	CHITCHAT
You know it typically is not going to lie to you and tell you is not typically in most cases a good tattoo is super expensive, you know.	CHITCHAT
But for a tattoo artist, that really, really, really.	CHITCHAT
Once the show.	CHITCHAT
You know their work.	CHITCHAT
A lot of times they will do things that are not.	CHITCHAT
As expensive as you would expect because they are there trying to.	CHITCHAT
They're trying to showcase what they're doing.	CHITCHAT
You know, and that was for me.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people got a lot of really nice.	CHITCHAT
Um, really well done tattoos that are that were like a lot.	CHITCHAT
Less expensive than you would expect because I was trying to showcase something.	CHITCHAT
And and.	CHITCHAT
The idea behind that was if I actually got enough art in My Portfolio.	CHITCHAT
It would show people what I like to do, which is what you want to do in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
You want to show people.	CHITCHAT
What you like to do, an why you like to do it?	CHITCHAT
You know, and then when they know that you when they know what you want to do.	CHITCHAT
And why you like to do it?	CHITCHAT
They come to you and they ask you questions about in their curious and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
And then you get to actually show an explain why it is you like to do when you get more of that kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
So My Portfolio is now filled with things that I like to do now, granted.	CHITCHAT
I still get things that I don't really want to do.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's just the nature of the beast.	CHITCHAT
You know you're a tattoo artist.	CHITCHAT
You work for other people.	CHITCHAT
You are a Commission based by artists.	CHITCHAT
So 90% of the stuff that you're getting.	CHITCHAT
Is probably going to be things that you just you really don't want to do.	CHITCHAT
But in the end of the day, it's to make money and you want to make money so you can't.	CHITCHAT
You can't necessarily be like I don't want to do that.	CHITCHAT
You know, your mentality should always be, you know.	CHITCHAT
I gotta pay bills first.	CHITCHAT
Secondly, I want to make good art.	CHITCHAT
You know you don't now.	CHITCHAT
With That being said, you'd only just go and do anything just to make money.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause If you don't love what you do.	CHITCHAT
You're going to ruin a lot of people skiing, so don't take on jobs that you really are happy about.	CHITCHAT
You know, first and foremost when they come into the shop and they present the idea to you.	CHITCHAT
Understand that that is your portfolio.	CHITCHAT
Whatever a client brings into your shop, it is literally your portfolio.	CHITCHAT
It is literally what you're going to be known for.	CHITCHAT
It is literally what people are going to seek you out for.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
With That being said, be very careful.	CHITCHAT
With what you take on, because that would that in which you take on will, it will eventually be.	CHITCHAT
Your.	CHITCHAT
Style or or what people think you can do.	CHITCHAT
So me that's how I became the butterfly and fell out.	CHITCHAT
Flower guy.	CHITCHAT
I did not want to do butterflies and Flowers an and things like that when I first started doing tattooing I was so against it was ridiculous, you know.	CHITCHAT

But I had this incident where my friend was tattooing a client and she was with her grandmother 'cause she brought her grandmother with her to get her first tattoo, which I thought was actually pretty cool, you know?	CHITCHAT
And her and Grandma sitting up in the air and Gramma had no tattoos.	CHITCHAT
OK, and.	CHITCHAT
Grandma sitting there and more grandma watched the granddaughter getting tattooed.	CHITCHAT
Grandma wanted a tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Grandma went to the other to the guy and was, like you know, when she's done.	CHITCHAT
You know, can I could I bother you for the same thing?	CHITCHAT
The guy came to me, you know, and was like, Hey, my client is looking to get tattooed.	CHITCHAT
She wants to get one done but when I get done I'm leaving.	CHITCHAT
You know I was wondering if you wanted to do the tattoo dog.	CHITCHAT
Typically I was not I don't want to do this crap, you know, like I don't want to do that.	CHITCHAT
'cause I was on my ego back then.	CHITCHAT
You know, when I was when I was in tattooing and I was younger I was on my ego trip.	CHITCHAT
I ain't doing that blah blah blah.	CHITCHAT
So anyways the client.	CHITCHAT
Of course, I'm not going to tell him know in front of the client 'cause that's just bad.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
Like that's not good business.	CHITCHAT
So I was like, Yeah man, I'll do it.	CHITCHAT
This is no big deal whatever.	CHITCHAT
What does she want?	CHITCHAT
And he was like a butterfly and I'm like God, my brain.	CHITCHAT
I'm just like why would you even ask me that right?	CHITCHAT
So I'm like alright I'll do it you know it's just a freaking butterfly, suck it up, it's extra money.	CHITCHAT
It was like $150.	CHITCHAT
I was like it's it's a $350.00.	CHITCHAT
Take the money you know so.	CHITCHAT
Of course, you know I, I figure out where she wants it and she wants it on her.	CHITCHAT
Her on her shin or right right above her foot.	CHITCHAT
And she of course she wants it to look like it's 3D and I'm like, well, that's that's a no brainer, you know so?	CHITCHAT
You know, I draw it up 'cause I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why people go to Google.	CHITCHAT
To get like.	CHITCHAT
Stuff like that, so I draw it up.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
We start tattooing.	CHITCHAT
And I get the tattoo on.	CHITCHAT
I get the butterfly on it and then I start doing my my flair.	CHITCHAT
You know where you put lighting and you put really deep color, you know so it could be super bright.	CHITCHAT
And then I add shadows and all that.	CHITCHAT
The butterfly actually looked good.	CHITCHAT
But it's a butterfly in my brain.	CHITCHAT
I'm like man is a butterfly like.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it's cool and everything, but it's a butterfly, you know, like in my brain I'm like it looked nice and I knew it looked nice but I couldn't.	CHITCHAT
I was so arrogant that I couldn't enjoy the fact that I did a good butterfly 'cause I was like.	CHITCHAT
It's just a butterfly.	CHITCHAT
Well, the the client loved it.	CHITCHAT
The client loved it a lot.	CHITCHAT
So you know it was a win win.	CHITCHAT
I got my money, you know an I did the butterfly.	CHITCHAT
Now here's the part.	CHITCHAT
You know, the clients granddaughter gets done with her butterfly and the other tattoo artist goes to the bathroom.	CHITCHAT
The client.	CHITCHAT
My client, her granddaughter, saw her butterfly and didn't like the butterfly she just got.	CHITCHAT
From my friend.	CHITCHAT
And she was like, I'm sorry I don't really mean to bug you with this, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
And I don't really know how to ask you, but would you mind fixing my butterfly?	CHITCHAT
and I was like I looked at her and I'm kind of like she serious.	CHITCHAT
She's not serious.	CHITCHAT
And she was like I.	CHITCHAT
I don't really.	CHITCHAT
She's like it's not a bad butterfly, just.	CHITCHAT
I like your butterfly better, you know and I'm like, well, ma'am, I we can't necessarily do that.	CHITCHAT
It's bad taste, you know.	CHITCHAT
Typically you can just ask your tattoo artists and they'll fix it.	CHITCHAT
And she was like, Yeah, but like I want my butterfly to look like my grandma's and she was real adamant about it.	CHITCHAT
And I'm like, well, I could ask him and she's like no, I don't really want, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't really want the confrontation and I'm like, well, I'm sorry I can't.	CHITCHAT
Do it you know, unless you know 'cause it in tattooing we have.	CHITCHAT
We have advocated.	CHITCHAT
We have we have we have things that lines that we just won't cross, and one of the lines we don't cross is.	CHITCHAT
We don't.	CHITCHAT
We don't snake other peoples clients.	CHITCHAT
You know if you work at a shot with somebody, the last thing you do is snake another persons client.	CHITCHAT
So in order for you to tattoo that persons client that person must agree.	CHITCHAT
To you tattooing their client.	CHITCHAT
You know, so I was like well if in order for me to tattoo you I have to ask him.	CHITCHAT
If it's OK, I'm like I just can't do it.	CHITCHAT

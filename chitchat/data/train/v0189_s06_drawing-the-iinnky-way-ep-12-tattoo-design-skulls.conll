It's not, it's you know it's against our rules, you know so.	CHITCHAT
She was like, OK, well I'll tell you what she was like can you, can you ask him?	CHITCHAT
And then can we make an appointment for a day that he's not here?	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't want to have to deal with all of that and I'm like well, yeah, sure I'm not so I'll tell you what leave me a number and I'll text you and I'll see what he says.	CHITCHAT
If he says no then I'm just.	CHITCHAT

I'm just not going to do it anyways he was like is fine is whatever you know.	CHITCHAT
He was that he was a little kind of that she didn't come to him about it.	CHITCHAT
But like he understood, you know and he was like yeah don't matter man, he's like go ahead and you know whatever it makes the client half you know.	CHITCHAT
So I called her and I tell her yeah, he said it was cool or whatnot and she came in and we fixed her tattoo and stuff like that and then like they posted both of their tattoos on the Internet and I posted the grandma's tattoo on the Internet and that post.	CHITCHAT
Caused all of these new peoples to start coming to me for butterflies.	CHITCHAT
Because the butterfly and I'm like I'm thinking like why is this such a popular thing?	CHITCHAT
I'm like in my brain and like it's a It's a It's a freaking butterfly.	CHITCHAT
It's not that big of a deal but but but then when you think about it, it's like what I'm not think what I am not thinking about is and what is actually sad and shouldn't be that way is that.	CHITCHAT
More soul than not.	CHITCHAT
There's a, there's lots of tattoo artist that just can't draw butterflies you know, and their tattooing you know.	CHITCHAT
And it's like like I I was told when I started tattooing, you know and it's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not.	CHITCHAT
It's no.	CHITCHAT
It's nothing against their character or their ability to do tattooing, you know.	CHITCHAT
But I was told that.	CHITCHAT
If you're going to tattoo.	CHITCHAT
There are things that you should know.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
About tattooing Before you start tattooing and one of the things that you know or you should know about tattooing is.	CHITCHAT
You should know these 10 things that every tattoo artist should know how to draw.	CHITCHAT
One of the 10 things that you should these tattoo artist should know how to draw.	CHITCHAT
Or like when will butterflies would be one of 'em, obviously, but you know it's like skulls is one.	CHITCHAT
You have stars and swirlies you have daggers, you know you have.	CHITCHAT
Letters.	CHITCHAT
There's there's things that had to order should literally know how to draw on the body and and.	CHITCHAT
Butterflies being one of them because there are, they are actively asked for in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
It's one of those things that you just know that if you're a tattoo artists, butterflies are on the are always on the menu.	CHITCHAT
Fairies are always on the menu menu.	CHITCHAT
Congees Swirlies.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of things that people just walk in the shop and they ask for that.	CHITCHAT
You generally have to know how to do.	CHITCHAT
And if you don't know how to do them.	CHITCHAT
You're probably not going to make that much money you know, and that was kind of weird.	CHITCHAT
That whole thing was where it was like.	CHITCHAT
These, like a lot of people that do tattoos they don't like.	CHITCHAT
I was when I finally realized that a lot of people that do tattoos really don't know how to draw.	CHITCHAT
You know, they're learning.	CHITCHAT
Because their tattoo artist not becoming tattoo ours because they draw.	CHITCHAT
I was one of the few people in my town that actually knew how to draw, but with learning how to tattoo, I always thought that people knew how to tattoo.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I knew how to draw and then they got in a tattoo E, but it was exactly the opposite in my years of being a tattoo artists things have have slowly progressed in the opposite direction, which is great.	CHITCHAT
You know, people are becoming more.	CHITCHAT
Artists then tattooers, you know, a lot of people come from different walks of life and tattooing.	CHITCHAT
You know like you wouldn't believe some of the things that people did before they started tattooing and then you and then they get into tattooing and then you see their work and you're just like Oh you know like.	CHITCHAT
Client once told me that most had tours that did tattooing back in the day and wear that stigma came from was it was for people that couldn't find work.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause you know like they were in prison or something like that, which is where that whole stigma came from.	CHITCHAT
And then their friends would be like you can become a tattoo artist and they would teach them how to tattoo and.	CHITCHAT

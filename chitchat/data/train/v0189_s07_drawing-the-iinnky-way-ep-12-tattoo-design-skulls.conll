Put them in the shop and have them work for him as a way of keeping their business that was dying afloat because he he would tell them that he would be like a lot of tattoo artists.	CHITCHAT
Businesses were they wouldn't last very long because they didn't have.	CHITCHAT
They couldn't keep up with productivity or the the tattoo artist in question would be involved in other stuff.	CHITCHAT
You know that would probably be, you know, detrimental to their business.	CHITCHAT
You know, regardless, they were into a lot of things, you know, and they would.	CHITCHAT
They would hire people on so that they could keep productivity up.	CHITCHAT
Plus a lot of them were.	CHITCHAT
They typically tattooed a lot of the same kind of clients like that's where the whole biker gang thing and stuff came from.	CHITCHAT
Like if you tattooed gang members, you tattooed mostly gang members.	CHITCHAT
That was just kind of a thing that people just kind of new like if you tattooed gang members, you mostly tattooed gang members.	CHITCHAT
You know if you tattooed bikers, you tattooed mostly bikers.	CHITCHAT
You know, if you like that and that was the thing.	CHITCHAT
If like you were a Japanese tattoo artist, you did mostly Asian style tattoos.	CHITCHAT
That kind of us.	CHITCHAT
That kind of mentality or mind state is still pretty present to this day.	CHITCHAT
What I mean by that is when people walk into your shop, they look at you and think, well, I'm not going to that person because that person only does this kind of work.	CHITCHAT
You know, they don't necessarily know that you do all kinds of work.	CHITCHAT
I can't tell you how many people come in and look at me and think that I do like the things that people, the things that people have openly said.	CHITCHAT
That I do is just shocking, you know.	CHITCHAT
Like they will come in because of course you know, like it, you're stereotyped in every category.	CHITCHAT
In in tattooing is really big.	CHITCHAT
You know it's really big stereotype.	CHITCHAT
They put you in a bubble really quick.	CHITCHAT
Tattoo artists and clients alike.	CHITCHAT
Until they get to know you, of course clients, our clients are just ignorant to the ways of how tattooing works, so you can forgive them.	CHITCHAT
But tattoo artists?	CHITCHAT
It's like it's so funny that they do it and it's you get used to it after awhile, you know and you understand that it's just it.	CHITCHAT
It's the lack of.	CHITCHAT
It's the lack of being out of wherever you were at right.	CHITCHAT
You know, when you're in your little bubble, you know, and a lot of tattoo artist would meet me and they would ask what I do when I would say everything and they would automatically assume that was because of Google that you do everything like 'cause you Google all your stuff and I'm like, no I could draw anything.	CHITCHAT
I like to do custom work, you know.	CHITCHAT
And then of course sizing up happens.	CHITCHAT
There's this thing that happens in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
Where when you meet somebody as a tattooer, the first thing you want to know is what they do for one of two reasons.	CHITCHAT
You want to know.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
What kind of a beast this person is, you know, like are they?	CHITCHAT
Are they going to, you know, are they are they?	CHITCHAT
Are they a threat you know or something like that?	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
And then you want to know if a person is like bluffing or whatever 'cause everybody is.	CHITCHAT
Tattoo artist men or women get together.	CHITCHAT
Typically a lot of times is that it's that staredown where it's like you know a lot of guys tattoo artist don't like other men around their stations and stuff when they're tattooing simply because they think they're going to steal their clients.	CHITCHAT
Me, I don't think that way because I'm like if a client is going to go to someone else, they're going to go to someone else.	CHITCHAT
I I'm a firm believer that if if you do original one of a kind work and your client goes to someone else, they're generally going to someone else because they want that clients type that they want.	CHITCHAT
That tattoo artist type of work.	CHITCHAT
An regardless, I'm not going to stop him, but tattoo artists have this thing where they don't want their clients to go to anybody else and they will literally stupid too.	CHITCHAT
Guilt tripping their clients, telling all you're taking food out of my kids mouth and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
And it's like dude.	CHITCHAT
You had like with any in any.	CHITCHAT
If you were thinking about becoming a tattoo or in any profession in order to keep up, you must be able.	CHITCHAT
To evolve if you're not trying to evolve your tattoo skills and you get left behind, you can't blame anybody else.	CHITCHAT
Because you are responsible for your, you know your own success.	CHITCHAT
Like you can't.	CHITCHAT
You know, even if your client goes to someone else, it's like that's one client.	CHITCHAT
You it is literally arrested.	CHITCHAT
Responsibility of you to keep up with the demand of what your clients want.	CHITCHAT
You know your clients might actually see you know, like your clients are constantly on the Internet.	CHITCHAT

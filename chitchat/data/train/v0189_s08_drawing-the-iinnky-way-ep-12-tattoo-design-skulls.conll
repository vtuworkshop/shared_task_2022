You know you don't want to be apart of trends.	CHITCHAT
You want to set trends so when someone comes to you and say, you know I want watercolor, you have to tell them, yeah, you can get watercolor, but can you get watercolor like this, you know?	CHITCHAT
Or I want Japanese like you know, concept designs.	CHITCHAT
I want to Japanese type tattoo OK?	CHITCHAT
In Japanese design, but I can do I just want you to know that I can do Japanese designs like this, you know?	CHITCHAT
On that same note, if you are not of that culture, be mindful of the culture you know which is another thing that people do.	CHITCHAT
You know Americans americanize everything, so it's like in America when someone says they want something Japanese, they're doing it to be trendy.	CHITCHAT
But if you have an actual Japanese person come to you and they want to Japanese tattoo, their stuff has me do your freaking research.	CHITCHAT
You know, find out what things mean because you know you don't want somebody going back home and getting kidnapped because they have a jakusz attach who want him in there not.	CHITCHAT
Related to that kind of stuff, and that is a real thing that tends to happen.	CHITCHAT
You know people get into trouble with their work.	CHITCHAT
Because they don't think about it.	CHITCHAT
When they get it, tattooing is.	CHITCHAT
It's coming to a point where it is.	CHITCHAT
It actually hasn't.	CHITCHAT
It has an actual real world impact, you know, or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
Just tuned in and wondering what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
I'm just I'm designing an actual tattoo for a client.	CHITCHAT
The client said he wanted a full sleeve of skulls.	CHITCHAT
So that's what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Making a fool skull sleeve since I have free range, you know like I am going nuts with what I would love to see from, you know.	CHITCHAT
That kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people don't necessarily get this kind of range, but once you get good enough at tattooing, your client is typically don't want to mess with your flow.	CHITCHAT
They literally want you to do whatever it is that you want to do and when.	CHITCHAT
When a client gives you free range is your opportunity to be able to show them what you can and cannot do.	CHITCHAT
You know, if you screw the pooch, you can't blame anybody but yourself, you know?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
But for me.	CHITCHAT
What I actually started thinking.	CHITCHAT
When I when people started giving me the opportunity to do my own like to be my own creative person.	CHITCHAT
I actually started feeling like holy crap like for the first time ever.	CHITCHAT
People actually want to see what I like, what I have in my brain.	CHITCHAT
Someone actually cares about what I want to do.	CHITCHAT
You know an I was like.	CHITCHAT
Well, instead of me being on my ego trip like I used to be, I'm gonna show people I'm going to show the world.	CHITCHAT
What could be in tattooing rather than what is in tattooing which is what you get a lot of.	CHITCHAT
You get a lot of people doing.	CHITCHAT
What is an tattooing?	CHITCHAT
Meaning they get into tattooing and then they just had to the same exact stuff, you know.	CHITCHAT
And it blows my mind.	CHITCHAT
Hold on 1 second guys.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, they get into tattooing and it's like you know, like you get a lot of people that get into tattooing and they're like.	CHITCHAT
They have big plans.	CHITCHAT
But then when they get in, it's just kind of like whatever.	CHITCHAT
I just want to make money so that I can do other stuff is like their brain.	CHITCHAT
Their brain is not really on tattooing.	CHITCHAT
The brain is on getting money from tattoo 'cause it is easy money out.	CHITCHAT
I'll tell you.	CHITCHAT
First hand, making money in tattooing is easy because most of the time you're just.	CHITCHAT
You're just redoing what other people bring you.	CHITCHAT
But At the same time, you also have that.	CHITCHAT
How do I explain it?	CHITCHAT
You also have that.	CHITCHAT
Obligation to your clients.	CHITCHAT
Where your clients come to you and they trust you and when they come to you and they trust you, they expect a lot more from you than just you know.	CHITCHAT
Second, second hand, whatever.	CHITCHAT
Hey, Germany, Hey Oscar.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, there's people from Germany and Austria.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I want to go to Germany.	CHITCHAT

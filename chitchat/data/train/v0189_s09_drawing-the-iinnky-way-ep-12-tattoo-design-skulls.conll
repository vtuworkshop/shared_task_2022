For tattooing, 'cause I heard.	CHITCHAT
And I've known some really good German tattoo artists.	CHITCHAT
You know they, I heard that the tattoo seems not that big out there, but the scene that is there.	CHITCHAT
They are doing some next level stuff.	CHITCHAT
That's the other thing is like you, you have to understand that tattoo artists are nomadic.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
They are nomadic in nature and they.	CHITCHAT
You have to be that way for business clients in your city don't sustain you for that long.	CHITCHAT
It's just like understanding that when you buy a sketchbook that sketchbook is eventually going to be filled up.	CHITCHAT
That is literally what it is like when you tattoo in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
It's like you have to understand that you're about to run out of client someday, know when you when you travel the world, you get the you get the clients you desire and you get known all over the place, you know.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Dude, I'm like like some of the stuff that I actually want to do.	CHITCHAT
I know that I would not be able to do in the city that I'm in.	CHITCHAT
I live in a very, very highly tourist populated city.	CHITCHAT
I live in Las Vegas.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Like it's it's tourist central, but when you live in a tourist populated city you get tourists tourist literally don't want.	CHITCHAT
Anything but tourist stuff 'cause they want quick things.	CHITCHAT
What I'm trying to do takes sessions.	CHITCHAT
So like I'm building this skull sleeve, you know.	CHITCHAT
But this skull sleeve is literally hold on.	CHITCHAT
Let me.	CHITCHAT
Save that would have been bad.	CHITCHAT
That would have been bad.	CHITCHAT
Always save ladies and gents.	CHITCHAT
I usually have something set up.	CHITCHAT
This late to say, but I didn't.	CHITCHAT
So I'm building this skull sleeve, right?	CHITCHAT
But a lot of the things that I want to try to do.	CHITCHAT
Are my main focus is to become the best?	CHITCHAT
I want to become one of the best tattoo designers, not necessarily tattoo artists.	CHITCHAT
I've been tattooing forever, so for me it's like it's tattooing.	CHITCHAT
I pick up a pencil and I do my thing.	CHITCHAT
I want to be good at designing tattoos just.	CHITCHAT
I want to be able to design a tattoo so epic, but I wanted to take less than a day.	CHITCHAT
That's my general idea.	CHITCHAT
So something like this, I'm going to redraw this, but something like this should be way more epic, and it should take less time.	CHITCHAT
This is the story of Persephone, and this is something that always try to teach people when it comes to tattooing, is that the story of Persephone or any any kind of story you do has to be done in one picture and everything that is like focal point.	O
Or focused of about that specific.	O
Story you have to capture in one picture.	O
I'm going to redraw this 'cause First off, when I did it.	O
I just tried to get the concept on paper.	O
It's very simplified.	O
A lot of this stuff.	O
I want to redraw make more more elegant I guess.	O
But the problem with this is is the bigger you make the design, the less likely is going to fit on a body space.	O
You know it's space versus time versus pain versus, well, money.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
If you take money out of the equation, the other two are still just as important.	O
You know, and that's kind of where I'm at right now with the whole like this particular piece.	O
This piece is designed for an arm.	O
If I redraw, it is going to be for a leg because it's going to get bigger.	O
I want to make her a lot more.	O
Detailed I definitely want to make Persephone a lot more detail in a lot more proportionate.	O
You know, 'cause that pomegranate in her hand doesn't look like a pomegranate?	O
'cause I just kind of put a marker there.	O
The birds I want to be a lot more detail.	O
Satan is going to be a lot more detailed.	O
The fruit and stuff is going to be a lot more detail, but I draw really quick concepts of what I want to do.	O
And then I go back in and I do them later like this concept right here.	O
Everything about this concept to school except for her face.	O
I every time I look at this, I'm like what is wrong with the face is the way it's supposed to be.	O
It's just I didn't put enough time into making it look like half of A.	O
Like, you know, fully formed like regular face and half of a skull face where the skin is like you know decaying off and stuff like that.	O
I literally just threw it together.	O
You know the only part that I put effort into was the Reaper.	O
I put effort into everything else except for her face.	O
So the concept is finished except for her face.	O
But every time I look at it, I'm just like.	O

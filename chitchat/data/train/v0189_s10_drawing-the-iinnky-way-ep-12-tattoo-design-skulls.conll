What I don't want people to see is this and then become really mad stuff like that, you know.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Would you make this or something similar to a print?	O
Yeah, I'm actually going to if I don't.	O
OK, so my long term goal is to make tattoo designs and have them in books like just designs.	CHITCHAT
'cause I know that eventually I'm not going to want to tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Every day you know like a normal tattoo artist.	CHITCHAT
So I would like to make art to sell 2 tattooers.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I would totally.	CHITCHAT
I'm totally gonna end up putting something like this in a book now.	CHITCHAT
I have a patriotic.	CHITCHAT
Right, and I'm going to start putting my tattoo concepts in my Patriot.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys want to join my Patreon, you can join my Patreon if you want, I am going to make a category believe this week for tattoo designs because I realize that there are a lot of people out there that are a lot there.	CHITCHAT
Really interested in the design work for whatever reason doesn't really matter.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
I used to be common like and I could not get to give people my work, you know, like.	CHITCHAT
You know how most tattoo artists are?	CHITCHAT
Most artists you very stingy with your work because it's your work.	CHITCHAT
I have I draw too much to care.	CHITCHAT
About something that I've done after I've done it.	CHITCHAT
You know, and that's That's like my.	CHITCHAT
That's like my theme, you know is I have gotten to a point where what I do doesn't necessarily matter as much once it's done.	CHITCHAT
And now and now I just want to share my heart with everybody.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's like I will draw a design and then as soon as I draw design, I move on to the next thing.	CHITCHAT
I almost it's almost to say I forget about what I'm doing because I just I want to.	CHITCHAT
I just want to consistently become a better.	CHITCHAT
Designer of tattooing the things that you have to understand about tattooing that make it very simple.	CHITCHAT
Is it literally is just OK, so here are three things you have to understand about designing a good tattoo for any of you guys that actually care.	O
1st is composition.	O
And Hello India, I see you out there guys.	CHITCHAT
Welcome from all over the world I can't believe so many people watching me from all over the world I love the Internet.	CHITCHAT
I absolutely do.	CHITCHAT
It is beautiful thing.	CHITCHAT
So three things you have to understand about designing a tattoo.	O
The first thing is the focal point that is absolutely, positively the most important thing is the.	O
The focal point meaning what you want people to look at me as soon as you see the tattoo.	O
As soon as you see the tattoo, that's what you want people to see as literally what you want people to go for.	O
Anything else outside of that you don't care about it, as that's absolutely, positively, 100% what you want people to see the minute they walk by.	O
You know 'cause my in my mind, I'm like if people aren't.	O
If people don't want to invade your personal space, you aren't doing a good tattoo.	O
What was the 1st tattoo you've ever done?	O
Give me a second.	CHITCHAT
I'll tell you that story.	O
You gotta love that.	O
The second thing is background.	O
Background is of course whatever is behind the focal point.	O
It's it's a no brainer.	O
Whatever the heck is behind the focal point is of course, background.	O
Background is important because it makes the tattoo not look flat.	O
Makes it look like an actual tattoo, an not a sticker, it's.	O
Something that a lot of people miss the Mr Mr the mark on 'cause like say someone draws a skull tattoo, but there's nothing behind is just the skull.	O
It looks like someone just took a skull and stuck a sticker on your arm.	O
Whereas if you put background behind it, something to make it more in depth it.	O
It has more meaning.	O
To it, you know.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
And then of course the last part, which is the part that I struggle with a lot that I'm that I'm.	O
Constantly practicing on because of its filigree.	O
Filigree for any of you guys that don't know if you see me trying to merge these skulls together, you know that's filigree.	O
It's literally taking any element you can from the tattoo an making it ornamental, making it like design wise so.	O
The best I think the best piece that I've done so far too.	O
Incorporate filigree was one I just showed you guys.	O
This one filagree would be the smoke from the candle.	O

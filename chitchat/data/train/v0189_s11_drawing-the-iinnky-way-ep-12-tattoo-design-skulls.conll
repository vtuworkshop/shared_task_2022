Anything that will encapsulate the tattoo that you can use to fill in extra space.	O
That's why it's called filigree.	O
Usually its leaves you know stuff like that.	O
Things that things that bring the tattoo together, you know.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
That's one of the things that I struggle with alot like when I do tattoos like this.	O
Which I actually just did this.	O
It's actually on the clients arm.	O
We did it just last weekend.	O
Before you know, everything went awry again with the pandemic.	O
The leaves and stuff on the outside, like I was telling her 'cause she was like Oh my God like I don't know if that's gonna fit and I'm like the leaves are OK to overlap.	O
It's going to be underneath so that it looks like a continuous rap.	O
The filigree is the leaves.	O
The background actually is the Flowers.	O
And that's what kind of threw everybody off is like the background is the Flowers.	O
The focal point are the butterflies.	O
So it seems a little bit elaborate for butterflies, even though 'cause her whole concept was the Flowers.	O
But I told her I said we should make the entire tattoo black and Gray, make the butterflies color.	O
Because the focal point should be something that's so obscure.	O
That Icana draws people in the butterflies will capture the peoples.	O
I because it's bright, then once they actually see the butterflies they will notice holy crap.	O
Look at all that detail in those Flowers and stuff like that and then the Flowers will have death.	O
There will be stuff behind the Flowers.	O
There will be other Flowers behind the Flowers and silhouettes stuff like that and this is actually on the clients arm.	O
It fit beautifully which was super lucky because I didn't think it was going to fit that beautifully.	O
But that's where.	O
Knowing how to draw comes into play.	O
If you know how to draw.	O
You can, you can make things up as you go.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Hold on a second.	CHITCHAT
I'm getting on can't text back line.	CHITCHAT
But So the client wants to watch me draw their tattoo.	O
They do that a lot.	O
You know they don't necessary to think the cool thing about my clients.	O
They don't put in put in, they just watch me do their tattoos and they just let me do my thing.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Filigree is like extremely important, you know.	O
I mean like super important.	O
If you can't get filigree right.	O
Your tattoos, or like tattooing designing is just kind of going to go out the window.	O
You're going to count all your taxes are always going to kind of like hollow and stuff like that and that's kind of what I'm trying to teach my son.	O
You know 'cause he wants to be a tattoo artist in the big thing.	O
The biggest thing I'm trying to teach him is like the one of the harder challenges in tattooing is filigree.	O
You have to be able to understand how to take any element.	O
No matter what it is and make it ornamental an make it complete your sleeve.	O
Otherwise, you're just going to be doing one offs all the time.	O
What are one offs?	O
'cause I know that that's the question that gets asked a lot 1 offs.	O
Are basically tattoo designs.	O
That are literally meant to be done just once and move on.	O
Now a lot of tattoo artist will reuse stuff, but I don't.	O
I don't really use any designs.	O
Absolutely not ever.	O
Everything I do is just a one shot deal.	O
Where did I put those?	O
Hearts Yeah I have a lot of designs and I just throw them places.	O
I should probably stop doing that.	O
Wait, I think I might have been the same folder I had it before.	O
Be organized, ladies and gentlemen, is very important, like be organized.	O
These are what I consider to be one off.	O
These are concepts that are pretty similar but different.	O
They're all in the shape of hearts, but they all have different concepts.	O
I draw these when I'm bored to stretch my creativity, and I have a collection of my think of up to about 76 different ones.	O
You know of all different designs and stuff like that.	O
Whenever I get a design that comes to mind, I will draw a one off.	O
So that someone will come and get this design.	O
It's a quick $350.00, you know, for me 'cause it could be different for somebody else you know.	O
and I don't necessarily have to.	O
Think about it, it's something that will help you think outside the box when it comes to designing tattoos, which a lot of people don't do.	O
And if what you will be limited to if you don't understand.	O

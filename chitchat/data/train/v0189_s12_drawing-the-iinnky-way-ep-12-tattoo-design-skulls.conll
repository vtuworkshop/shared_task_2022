Filigree and stuff like that.	O
Your backgrounds will just not, it won't.	O
They won't pop to tattoo won't feel like it fits together.	O
It would just be an ongoing.	O
Like mess.	O
You know, and that's why you know if you're going to get into tattooing, remember those three things.	O
You need focal point.	O
The actual focus of what the tattoo is about.	O
You need background background complements the foreground, IE whatever is whatever the focal point is, and then fill agree to tie it all together.	O
You master those three things.	O
You'll be able to create great tattoo design.	O
Now understand this too if you're if you don't want to do tattooing, you don't have to.	O
You can create tattoo designs and sell them to tattoo artists.	O
Any great tattoo artist knows that your best clients are going to be other tattoo artists.	O
I create tattoos.	O
Four tattoo artists and Mia like you know.	O
So if I draw something that I know that I will never be able to tattooed with my client tail just doesn't permit, I will sell it to another tattoo artists or another client.	O
The client I sell my tattoo designs to clients all the time.	O
Once I sell it to you is yours.	O
You are literally the only person is going to own that.	O
I'm not going to go and resell it to someone else.	O
Because I draw too much in my pride would not allow me to sell something and then go back and then sell it to somebody else for money.	O
I would rather do something bigger an better because nine times outta 10 when I'm done drawing something I don't like it anymore.	O
You know I'm going to draw this skull sleeve and then after that I'm going to be like I could have done this, this and this and this and this and this would have been so much better and I could have used this.	O
Right now I'm using kinda like a Smokey element to bring the piece together and allow me to form these skulls the way that I want, but afterwards I'm like man I could have done bricks.	O
I could have done this.	O
I will have so many ideas in my head of things I could have used to connect the skulls.	O
You know that I will definitely want to redo it again.	O
You know, that's just how my brain works 'cause I'm more.	O
I spent so many years.	O
You know, wasting time that now when I do stuff my my mentality is I gotta stop wasting time I need to do more and more art.	O
Go go go.	CHITCHAT
So when you guys asked what was my first tattoo ever, OK, so.	O
When I first started tattooing.	O
I understand that I was new at this and I.	O
Did it a completely wrong?	O
I had a client which was my sister.	O
That wanted me to tattoo her.	O
And.	O
I had just learned how to tattoo by my friend.	O
His name was styles he.	O
I thought he was a good tattoo artist he was.	O
This is what I actually realized how basic tattooing was.	O
Two people, you know, uhm.	O
How do I?	CHITCHAT
How do I explain it?	O
He could tattoo anything that people brought to him.	O
If it was something that was already known, he couldn't draw, he couldn't tattoo actual artwork.	O
That wasn't like I don't know.	O
Pre planned so to say.	O
I brought him my Phoenix.	O
OK, so he did.	O
He did my first tattoo ever.	O
Any I said it a pretty good job on it, you know.	O
But then I brought him a Phoenix that I Drew and it had a lot more detail in it.	O
And when he went to tattoo it.	O
He made it look like a flame and chicken.	O
I still have that on my arm because I will never cover it up because I want people to understand and I want to understand what I don't want to do to people every time I look at that, I'm like whenever I decide.	O
That I'm going to have it like, you know, have do a tattoo and kind of phone it in.	O
I look at what's on my arm and I'm like I don't want someone out there with something like that from me.	O
You know, and I just built tattoos that were cooler around it, so it's like whatever people were like.	O
What's that in the center and I give him the story and you know, it's good memories.	O
So in any case, my friend styles had just taught me how to tattoo.	O
He didn't teach me in the shop.	O
I learned the way wrong way and This is why I'm telling you guys this story, you know, and I got videos and I got all of these different things to learn how to tattoo.	O
'cause Yo, I'm going to be a tattoo artist and I'm about to tattoo so many names on some my First off.	O
When I was younger.	O
My whole motivation to become a tattoo artist was not to make money or anything like that.	O
It was literally so I could tattoo my name on girls.	O
Because in my brain.	O

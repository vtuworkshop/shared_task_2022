That was like the ultimate conquest.	O
And it was the ultimate way to like Braxton my friends and stuff like that.	O
Of course it was a different time.	O
You know, as I got into tattooing, I realized that that was stupid and I never actually did it.	O
But that was my motivation at the time.	O
You know, once I actually learned.	O
Of course, then it was like I just want to make cool tattoos and I just was like what how do we get your tattoos?	O
Submit it so you can make things other than this crap that everybody else is doing.	O
Which is.	O
I've learned to respect for this particular style, but back when I first started tattooing I was like is this crap?	O
I don't want to do it.	O
I'm not a fan of American traditional tattooing, but I learned it.	O
And the reason why I learned it is because you learn everything in tattooing so you can understand that the process in which you do each one so that you can become a better tattoo artist.	O
You know the other thing that you understand is like everything has a purpose and if you don't learn.	O
The purpose behind it you're going to always be behind everything that you do in tattooing has a lesson you know and that was one of the things that I first learned when I started tattooing was like yeah don't don't just sit up.	O
Don't just assume that because someone does something that it and you don't like it.	O
That is crap.	O
With That being said.	O
I just wanted to be really.	O
I just wanted to create better tattoos and what I have seen.	O
So anyways my first tattoo was on my sister.	O
She wanted a heart but she wanted some kind of like Jack skeleton nightmare before Christmas type heart you know.	O
So I got that.	O
I got the design now I'm an artist.	O
I can draw the design.	O
It was a freaking heart you know it was not that big of a deal.	O
I put some leaves around and stuff like that was Real Simple.	O
I didn't know how to tattoo so I'll watch.	O
Videos and stuff like that.	O
I did all of these things to prepare myself.	O
To do this tattoo I watched the video.	O
They told me that if I wanted to tattoo to stick on a scam because I'm like when my wife is going to come off.	O
How do I get the tattoo to stay?	O
My friend never taught me that he taught me how to put ink into skin.	O
That's it.	O
He literally taught me how to.	O
Put ink.	O
On the skin and make it stay so.	O
He basically taught me how to stretch the skin and applying he didn't teach me how to do stencil's any of that kind of stuff because his goal was to was too.	O
Basically, like grooming into being his partner and staying with him.	O
My idea was to get good an bounce as quick as possible because I wanted to do my own stuff and I didn't like the kind of tattoos he was doing.	O
He was good at what he what I saw him doing, but it was pretty much the same old plane stuff.	O
With That being said.	O
I watch videos, video said to use deodorant and was deodorant and something else.	O
But anyway, it was like a mixture of deodorant and some other stuff that was supposed to make the tattoo stick right?	O
So of course I look at it and I make the concoction and everything like that and I'm like, OK, I got that.	O
I went and got my $150 kit off of eBay.	O
It came in.	O
I had everything I needed I set up.	O
In my kitchen and my whole family's there and there all like doing their thing or whatever, my sisters getting ready.	O
I put the tattoo on.	O
It it the Stencil came off onto the body and I'm like, yes, I'm going to do this.	O
This is going to be great.	O
You know, I'm like I'm about to be a tattoo artist.	O
You know, like this is about to happen.	O
You know.	O
So like I.	O
Again, I watched videos.	O
Don't ever do this.	O
OK, I watched videos and I'm thinking like man, I watch these videos.	O
I hope everything was in it that I needed to know, you know.	O
I go to draw.	O
The first line, First off, a needle in from your tattoo machine, should only be awesome.	O
So like so far you would think this is a no brainer.	O
The further the need to further it goes into your skin, which you don't necessarily understand is when you're tattooing the needle goes so fast you can't see it.	O
Plus you don't never.	O
You don't ever like most of the time when you start tattooing.	O
The video said that the needles just has to be inside the tube.	O
They didn't say anything about what throw was OK, so for any of you guys don't know what throw is to throw is how hard the tattoo machine hits the depth.	O
Is how hard the tattoo comes out me.	O
The needle comes out of the machine.	O
You can adjust that.	O
You can adjust both the heart of the throw the more is going to punch into the skin.	O
The the longer the stroke is, the further is going to come out regardless.	O
It was supposed to be.	O
A.	O
I you not.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
The death that the death of it was literally supposed to be a Nichols.	O

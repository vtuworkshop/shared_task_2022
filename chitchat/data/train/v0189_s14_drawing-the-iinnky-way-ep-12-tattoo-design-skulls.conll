Thickness now imagine turning a nickel to the side and seeing how far the needle supposed to come out.	O
That's how far is supposed to come out of the out of the out of the tube.	O
Mines was not like that.	O
It was way further.	O
So I go to draw the first line and cut my sister skin open.	O
Like it literally made a gas and I just start wiping and I saw they eat there and I just went for my sisters like Oh well I'm like, you know calling her names and tell her to toughen up and all of this stuff like that.	O
And then it happened.	O
It was time to wipe and I wiped off the entire stencil like the entire stencil in one wife and I was like.	O
Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
I literally just wiped off the entire stencil.	O
I'm trying not to panic.	O
'cause I don't want my sister to see that I had just made a big mistake, so I'm sitting there and I'm trying to put the Stencil back online It up.	O
Finally, I was just like screw it and I freehanded the rest of it.	O
Now granted it was an easy design.	O
I drew it so it.	O
It worked out.	O
The lines were there all that, but like her leg was bleeding like crazy like I couldn't figure out why.	O
I'm like just don't look like what was in the video like what the heck did I do?	O
But I mean?	CHITCHAT
And then of course I took the Rag that you wipe it with or the paper towel as you wipe it with an I was using Vaseline which later on I realize you don't use Vaseline on tattoos.	O
This is just how primitive I was when I first started.	O
Put Vaseline we put put.	O
Click alcohol on the paper towel and wipe her leg with alcohol.	O
You do not use alcohol on a tattoo.	O
Ever.	O
But I didn't know this 'cause the video told me to use alcohol to clean it.	O
You don't use alcohol of a tattoo because alcohol burns.	O
Imagine getting like a full leg sleeve and someone wiping it down with alcohol.	O
They have this stuff called Green Soap which is mandatory.	O
For a tattoo and that Green Soap actually.	O
Disinfects the tattoo and it takes off all the other stencil stuff.	O
So when you put the stencil on the body, the Stencil is meant to stay there until you go over it with tattoo ink or you or you wipe it with the anti bacterial so those are those are the only two things that are supposed to take it off.	O
Alcohol will take it off but the thing with alcohol is it will take it off until it dries.	O
So if you put it on there and it starts to dry, you aren't going to get it off.	O
It's going to adhere to the skiing and less you tattoo over it so.	O
Of course I wipe my sister skiing with the alcohol and it was like on fire and she was like flipping out and the tattoo was done.	O
You know there was no shading, it was all line work and I'm like, yeah I did it.	O
Killed it like most tattoo artists like you.	O
Just you feeling yourself just like I don't care what nobody says.	O
I'm the greatest ever.	O
I pulled this off I thought I was going to ruin it.	O
I did ruin it, but my brain.	O
I was like I didn't ruin it.	O
I killed it.	O
No one's going to be able to tell me anything different, suck it whatever, anyways.	O
Fast forward.	O
Fast forward 2 weeks from then.	O
The entire the entire tattoo fell out.	O
Why did it fall out?	O
Because I put it too deep in the skin and his scarred it turned into a scar.	O
And once the scar healed, all the ink was gone.	O
So I did all of that.	O
For absolutely nothing.	O
Because it didn't say.	O
And that was like the first thing that I learned was like, holy crap, you know, like.	O
And then once I once I realize now grid now granted a lot of things happened within that two weeks.	O
'cause it was an exciting two weeks for me in tattooing, you know, I realize that you could buy this stuff called Stencil paper.	O
Because the stencil I was using.	O
I don't, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't understand how I didn't notice before, but I didn't know you could buy carbon paper and make your own.	O
Like tattoos bigger.	O
I was using some.	O
I was using something that I had used for another tattoo and just kind of like like rigging it to work.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I was watching it Miami ink.	O
If you guys have ever seen that show Miami ink was on me and my friends and of course this is just when I started tattoo.	O

We just when I started learning how to tattoo.	O
And like we're all watching Miami ink tattooing had just started becoming a big thing.	O
You know in America.	O
Anyways it started becoming well known and well accepted and it was no longer the thing that gang members an and stuff like that.	O
The stigma was starting to go away.	O
So we're watching Miami ink and I see them use this paper.	O
It's called carbon paper.	O
It's what you used to make a stencil that's custom.	O
Which basically is what you used to make a stencil because everybody makes custom tattoos nowadays so.	O
I saw this carbon paper and I'm like what is that everybody in in in the house is laughing at me because there aren't tattoo artist but I am, you know, and they're like that's what you used to put the Stencil on.	O
I'm like no you don't know like well I got a lot of tattoos.	O
I'm pretty sure I've seen my tattoo artist use this thing and I'm like now my person that taught me says you have to submit your idea to a company and they approve it.	O
And then you're allowed to do it.	O
That was a lie.	O
The guy told me a blatant lie so that I would not try to create my own tattoo designs.	O
'cause again he wanted to groom me to be his like sidekick or whatever.	O
He didn't want me to go off on my own so he lied to me about a lot of stuff.	O
You know, the minute I found out that I could actually draw my own at tattoos as big as I want and create my own stuff.	O
I immediately decided I wasn't going to tattoo anybody else anymore.	O
I was going to go and learn how to tattoo the right way and become so good.	O
That That will be what I would that would be.	O
all I have to do for a living now granted, I had a great job then I had a really good job then and I would eventually quit my really good job to do tattoo ink, uhm.	O
But That is generally how most people start off Tatooine.	O
You know, like it's always some Horror Story and the most for the most part, those people that actually sticks with it.	O
Because I got screwed over.	O
I gots camd out of five grand trying to get in the printer ship.	O
You know, because you have to have an apprenticeship you know the reason why you have to have an apprenticeship is because there's only things that there's things in tattooing that you can only learn.	O
From a tattoo artist.	O
And if you don't have an apprenticeship, you can start tattooing, but you will always be second rate forever because there are things that you just don't know that you just can't learn on your own and people just don't seem to understand that.	O
And when they try to get into tattooing, they always screw themselves because they always think that they can.	O
They are going to be there going to be The X Factor.	O
Everybody else can do this.	O
I can.	O
I will be the guy that revolutionizes tattooing and become the first guy to tattoo without an apprenticeship.	O
No, you're not going to be that guy in or girl.	O
You're going to end up ruining yourself and your career.	O
Being ridiculous.	O
You know, but.	O
You can't necessarily can't necessarily make people do things they don't want to do.	O
Like 90% of people, they they.	O
They automatically assume that they know what they do, they're doing, and they're smarter than you and what you don't want to do is you don't want to sit up and argue with somebody that is convinced that they are smarter than you.	O
You know to do something that's probably not in their best interest, so you just kind of let him do what they're going to do, you know?	O
I've run into a lot of those.	O
I've had Seven apprentices in my life since I've become good enough to teach people, and only one so far has made it.	O
Through the apprenticeship.	O
And that one person happened to be a female.	O
The mails it always ended in US almost getting into a fist fight.	O
Because they 'cause of course testosterone is just that simple man working together.	O
It's it always comes down to a respect factor and the thing that you have to understand about tattooing is if you want.	O
If you want your apprentice to be the best that they can be, they have to understand that something that is super important and that understanding is that.	O
You have to have humility.	O
You have to know how to humble yourself.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people teach their apprentices in the wrong way.	O
They teach them by hazing and stuff like that.	O
They teach them in a way in which the tattoo, the client start.	O
The Apprentice is usually reject.	O
I did not do that.	O
I was trying to teach.	O
My apprentice is the way that I thought that I felt they should learn, you know, but if I tell you to do something, the very last thing I expect from you is for you to tell me.	O

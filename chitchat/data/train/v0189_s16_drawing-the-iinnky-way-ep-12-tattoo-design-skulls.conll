I'm not going to do that, or I want to do it this way or tell me are you know.	O
Now again, granted, I like most tattoo artist charge money for an apprenticeship.	O
I was not charging money, I was doing it for free because I wanted him to get good and I wanted him to be great tattoo artist so that I could have a.	O
I was trying to build a beautiful team.	O
It didn't workout it just it didn't workout that way.	O
I learned really quick that you know it.	O
Ego gets in a way.	O
You know, especially if they start like doing the whole what I call that at the tattoo walk, which is when they go on the Internet and they start looking at what other people do and they start trying to walk in those people shoes and they have already seen the end before the beginning and they start at.	O
They start getting into that mind state where it's like teach me how to tattoo.	O
I'm ready to go make the money and it's like you don't know how to draw.	O
I'm not teaching you anything until you become a better artist.	O
And that sets them off.	O
Because in their brain you're holding them back.	O
I could be the greatest thing ever, and you're holding me back.	O
Hey Brazil, I see you welcome.	CHITCHAT
Hello from Las Vegas everybody.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That was one of the things that I would always run into an apprentice ship.	O
Can be anywhere from 5 grand to 10,000 depending on who you go to and people are like that's ridiculous.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
Think about how much money you could make as an average tattoo artist.	O
The average tattoo artist nowadays, depending on your skill set, I'm going to say the average custom tattoo artist.	O
So now when I say average, I mean extremely average.	O
You know, the average custom tattoo artist makes $150 an hour.	O
That's just what you make.	O
You don't have to.	O
You don't have to argue with your clients.	O
You don't have to discuss it.	O
You walk in a shop.	O
It's known $150 an hour.	O
Now people will know tattoo artist that do tattoos and they don't pay that much.	O
That is because you know that tattoo artists it is not.	O
It's not something that is just like if you know someone that does it for cheaper.	O
They're just doing it for you for cheaper.	O
Getting a cheaper tattoo does not make you cool and a lot of people think that is like, well I my tattoo artist doesn't charge me that much.	O
Your tattoo artist isn't it probably isn't as good as you think they are or their your friend.	O
Those that those are the only two.	O
If you run it, if you go into a tattoo shop and these people don't know you and their charging you less than $150 an hour or less than 100 an hour, they either aren't that good or they're probably friends of yours or something.	O
Most people, just, you know that's just the norm now.	O
You know, you know if they do hourly rates 'cause some people do session rates where they just charged by the session and they just charge you a flat rate for the whole session or they charge you by the peace.	O
Charging by the peace.	O
The reason why a lot of people stopped charging by the piece is because they find out real quick that they sometimes will undercharge and they will, and then they start tattooing this client and the client can't sit and there and there.	O
There are two session quote has now become six or eight sessions because the client can only sit for 30 minutes.	O
Now.	O
Understandably, you know you're thinking well if there only 30 minutes is really, it's really not that big of a deal.	O
Imagine tattooing one time a day.	O
And you've melted your brain around tattooing one time a day because that's what keeps you saying.	O
It's what gives you time to do the stuff that you do.	O
So you come in and you tattoo one person a day, because that's really all you need to do to make a living.	O
And it's it's you know, your tattoos are usually about five to six hours yadda Yadda Yadda.	O
And this client comes in they.	O
Um?	O
They are scheduled now.	O
Again, this is for this is for flat rate tattoos whereas you just tell somebody with their tattoo is going to cost.	O
And it doesn't change.	O
They come in, they get tattooed, you caught him.	O
You called him three sessions.	O
They come in.	O
They set for 30 minutes.	O
You can't leave the tattoo.	O
I finished 'cause they've paid for the entire tattoo, so every time they come in they said for 30 minutes and use a whole days worth of work because you didn't schedule anything else.	O
Now, the only way you can combat this is a sit in the shop and hope for Walkins which are nightmare or B.	O
Try to schedule another appointment that day and hope that this person doesn't automatically become like super, super tolerant and just sit like a Rock You know most actors aren't going to take the risk of overbooking, so when this client comes to get their tattoo done you don't schedule anything else.	O

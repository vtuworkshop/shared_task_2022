Which basically means you're losing money.	O
And that's the that's the nature of the beast, right?	O
There is that you typically end up losing money because the tattoo, the person that you agreed to tattoo.	O
You can't turn him away.	O
They pay for the tattoo.	O
You know, so that's why a lot of people stop doing session or or flat rate tattoos where it's like how much is this tattoo cost?	O
It's gonna cost this much because you're shooting yourself in the foot.	O
You are literally shooting yourself in the foot by.	O
Telling a client this is how much you're going to pay.	O
I mean, depending on if you do a one off again, one offs are different.	O
This is a one off.	O
These are actually one of us.	O
Believe it or not.	O
These are all.	O
These are also considered tattoo flash.	O
These are designed to do more than once, but for me it's a one off I would never do these more than once.	O
I think the only one of the ones I've done so far is this one right here.	O
And this one right here, and I designed these so that my son.	O
My son drew skulls and snakes and he's learning to be better tax or better artist because I won't teach him out of tattoo until it becomes a better artist.	O
I he drew skulls and snakes based on.	O
I don't know whatever you saw on the Internet or wherever he got his research from an I showed him I would draw skulls and snakes and I put it up so he can see it.	O
Add.	O
Study it.	O
People saw it and they wanted tattoos.	O
So of course I'm not going to be like no so attached and then my son got the bottom one.	O
So one of my clients got this one right here.	O
With the shouting gun from with the shouting on the four head for Naruto 'cause they were a new irlo fan and then this one down here my son got on the back of his legs.	O
Both of these are on my Instagram.	O
They I've since added to this peace 'cause now the client is turning it into a full rose sleeve with a skull at the bottom.	O
You know the skulls is kind of threw me off 'cause she was pretty girl and she wanted the skull and I was like damn that's kinda cool.	O
You know, like you don't get that you don't get that that often.	O
You know, so I just kind of.	O
I kind of ran with it and I was like, yeah, you know, but that kind of stuff.	O
When you're at when you're accustomed tattoo artist, use it up and you draw a lot of stuff for no apparent reason like this.	O
Right here.	O
I kind of blew my mind when I was asked to do a full school sleep, 'cause sometimes you see people with skull sleeves and they.	O
Don't look good and I don't mean like the art.	O
You know which I'm a big fan of art first, like if you ever see any of my Instagram Post, I always put this artist first name.	O
That usually means before you buy mentality is you need to be an artist Before you learn how to tattoo.	O
That's not.	O
A ruling tattooing and it literally is just my theory on it, because there are specific things in tattooing that will take an artist's touch.	O
And if you don't know how to tattoo and you're touching someone's body like imagine if I had wiped the stencil off on my sister and I didn't know how to draw, that would have been the end of tattoo and she would have had a giant like black line on her leg forever.	O
But because I know how to draw, I just winged it.	O
You know you don't want to wing a tattoo.	O
Plus, if you're drawing like like right now.	O
If I'm drawing this and for some reason the tattoo gets wiped off or I decide I want to change something because it doesn't fit the body the right way, I just change it on the fly.	O
The client never notices that.	O
Another thing that the clients never really notice that you don't pay attention to is that tattoo artist make mistakes and tattoos all the time.	O
You know, because people that Have you ever made a mistake we make, we make mistakes and tattoos so often that people don't notice them.	O
You know is because like if I'm drawing this and you see this, all you see are the things that I want you to see.	O
Which are the very highly you know, visible skulls.	O
I could put in anything in this that I want anyway that I want, but of course a good tattoo artist is going to try to make it.	O
You know, as artistic as possible and you of course you're going to be professional as possible.	O
'cause you got tattoo artist that put things in tattoo ours in tattoos that shouldn't be there because they deal with but hole clients all day long.	O
And yeah, don't ever ever ever take off your tattoo artist.	O
You know I've said this a million times an you just couldn't.	O
You would not believe how many people like to push the envelope is like.	O
Tattoo what you're giving someone free range to your skin and in your brain is like you wouldn't dare, and it's like no, they would dare don't.	O
Don't make your tattoo artist mad, it's just don't do it.	O

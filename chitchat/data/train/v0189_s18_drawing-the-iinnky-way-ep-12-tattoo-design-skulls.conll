It's like please just do not do that.	O
You know and yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's that's pretty much all I'm going to say about that is just don't don't do it.	O
OK, you know your tattoo artist has way more power than you could possibly imagine, and you don't want someone having free range.	O
Of your body being mad at you.	O
You know, I've heard stories of people putting genitals and tattoos.	O
I've heard stories of people putting their names and things that mark you forever in their tattoos because the clients were being butt holes.	O
Just don't just don't don't do that.	O
It's like people that handle your food.	O
You treat the people to handle your food with the utmost care.	O
You tip them.	O
You take great care of them because they're handling your food, you know.	O
You have no idea what these people could do.	O
If you push him the wrong way, not saying that that is what they will do Monday again, and you don't want you don't want to leave that to you, know the imagination of said people.	O
Actually, you know what I'm going to probably do.	O
Two skulls here.	O
When I'm actually going to do is this race.	O
This knows real quick erase these eyes.	O
We are going to do one skull going this way.	O
And we're going to do one.	O
Scroll down here going this way like this, but we are going to have the eyes.	O
Here and here.	O
And then we're going to use the center to make a very.	O
I don't know which I would try to wing it.	O
I'm not necessarily knowing how this is going to work by my general idea was to make the eyes of this.	O
Of these two, make a skull in a Sinner, but it might not work.	O
I might end up just making one upside down or whatever.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see how this goes.	O
And then that will.	CHITCHAT
That will actually tie in the full skull sleeve.	O
Now again, it doesn't.	O
The average tattoo artist can take days to design a tattoo, which is why you schedule your appointments and you don't just.	O
You know, do them at the drop of a hat, but I imagine if somebody walked in the shop to get this, I could have literally drawn this right on them right there.	O
You know now I could.	O
I could also rearrange a lot of this kind of stuff.	O
I could rearrange all of this and at any point 'cause I'm going to probably put like skulls hidden here and all over the place is going to be a fully functional skulls leave, you know.	O
What's the strangest tattoo I've ever done?	O
Depends on what you mean by strange.	O
I've had.	CHITCHAT
I've done a butt hole tattoo, which is probably the most unsettling tattoo to ever do, and now it's a trained for some reason people are trending getting their butt holes tattoo.	O
The most disturbing tattoo I've ever done to this date.	O
Was I had I had a lady come in.	O
Very nice lady.	CHITCHAT
Very very nice lady.	O
Come in and get a tattoo of a dead fetus.	O
Now.	O
I asked her plenty of times why she wanted it to be done and she said it was closure, you know, and again, when you're tattooing you don't necessary when up when a client wants something, you keep the questions to a minimum because it's their tattoo.	O
They can do whatever they want, um.	O
In my brain, I'm thinking like.	O
Like if you get this tattooed on you.	O
You're not going to have closure.	O
You're going to remember this forever.	O
You know in in her brain it was like well known as closure.	O
This is how this is how I'm going to deal with it.	O
I'm in no position to tell her anything different so you know it wasn't like the thing that thing, that thing that thing about it was.	O
It wasn't a.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't a like tiny fetus.	O
This was like A.	O
Like 6 Seven month fetus.	O
So in any case, yeah, like she.	O
She wanted that done, but because I was in my mentor I didn't.	O
I've never had an apprenticeship.	O
I did a mentorship where it was basically like I was being mentored and I worked and I learned while I was working.	O
So anything that came through the door I had to do it.	O
So I couldn't say no.	O
So she wanted it done.	O
I had to find a way to do it.	CHITCHAT
I had to figure out how to put it.	O
I had to basically make the client happy.	O
That was my job.	O
I could not complain, I just shut up and do the job because that was what they hired before they were like, you know, you gotta learn is how you gonna learn.	O
So I asked her questions.	O

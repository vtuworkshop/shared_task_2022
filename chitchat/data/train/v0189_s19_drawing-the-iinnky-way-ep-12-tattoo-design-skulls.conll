I asked her if she really wanted to do it.	O
I you know, whatever we got past all that an we decided OK.	O
Were you know like right where you wanted to go?	O
She wanted it on her leg you know I I'm like OK I asked her when she wanted it done she said right then you know so I told her OK?	O
Well since it's a portrait I can do it now 'cause I'm basically going to be using the portrait.	O
You just have to give me a couple minutes to make the Stencil.	O
So I took the portrait 'cause when you do a portrait you don't try to Freehand before you literally use the Dang portrait.	O
You know, so I took the portrait.	O
And I started stenciling it out, you know, and I'm like thinking like this is.	O
Oh my God, this is going to be the This is the worst idea you could possibly do for closure, but of course again, one of the things that I learned early on was like don't question with somebody else wants you know because you don't know their motives behind it.	O
You know, I remember telling a client at their idea was stupid only to find out that it was their grandma's picture, and that was that was something she drew for her and it was hot.	O
She remembered her and all it is.	O
It was horrible so I I would ask questions, but I would never go too deep.	O
As soon as they as soon as I saw that they were serious about what they wanted, I would never OK.	O
We're going to.	CHITCHAT
We're going to do it.	O
I made it.	CHITCHAT
I made it a purpose to not cry too much because a lot of people do that, you know.	O
And when someone is coming to get something they don't really necessarily want to answer questions for you, they're trying to deal with something that they're going through.	O
So I stenciled it thing out, you know, in.	O
We get or set up on the table and everything like that and I'm tattooing or an.	O
She is just bawling.	O
I mean like bowling, you know.	O
I wish I could say it was because the tattoo hurt, but it wasn't.	O
It was just she was going through stuff, you know.	O
I'll find out the baby literally died as yesterday before the taxes, which she shouldn't even been doing any of this kind of stuff, you know, shouldn't be getting a tattoo, but I I'm already tattoo in there and she's like telling me about it and she's like I.	O
Couldn't have I can have keys in this man.	O
This baby was like wasn't supposed to be, you know and Yadda Yadda Yadda and she's like I'm not going to attempt it anymore and I kill me.	O
All of this stuff and I'm just like Oh my God like I don't want to hear this like you know she's crying.	O
I'm trying to hold back the tears were tattooing.	O
Needless to say to tattoo came out beautiful.	O
You know it was a beautiful giant red fetus on her on her thigh.	O
I had a picture on my Instagram for awhile 'cause I was telling people to story and then I just took it down 'cause I was like I don't think about that anymore.	O
You know like that was one of the most awkward tattoos that I ever did.	O
You know and yeah.	O
I mean, but I've done a lot of weird hours.	O
There was a lot of we I've had a lot of weird incidents in tattooing.	O
Now granted I don't like.	O
I think The thing is, I don't want people to think that tattooing is just like that.	O
That's not tattooing for the most part is is are good experiences or happy experiences or normal client experiences where you come in, you get a tattoo and you pay and you go home.	O
You know there are occasions where you just don't see things coming and they just hit you out of the blue and you're like what the hell just happened.	O
My who saw that coming, you know, like you just have these clients that you just when you're learning how to tattoo.	O
'cause as you get as you get to a point in tattoo when you can see it coming and you're like new.	O
Not walking into this that's not going to happen.	O
I'm not going to not going to walk into that like you get to that point.	O
You know you get the point where you just like I'm not gonna happen so.	O
But there's something you just don't see coming.	O
You know, people that come in to get tattooed.	O
There's a reason why people say don't drink when you're tattooing you find that out real quick.	O
The one thing that I found out is that you.	O
You don't tell people.	O
The truth you tell them what they what.	O
They can't argue with, meaning the truth of the matter is like of course liquor makes you bleed more, and that's what people use as a reason for, not, you know, don't drink while you're getting tattoo 'cause you bleed a lot, that's not the real reason why you don't drink while you're tattooing, or you're getting tattooed.	O
The reason why you don't drink while you're getting tattooed is because most people act like morons when they're drunk.	O
And they don't.	CHITCHAT
And The thing is, is like you can't tell them that because they act even worse.	O
You know, if you tell someone not to move when they're drinking there like I'm not moving in there moving while they're telling you that movie.	O

Uh.	CHITCHAT
Well, thanks, I'm glad you wanna join the stories.	O
I have thousands of 'em thousands of am I had a client threw up on me once because they were drunk.	O
I had a guy slapping me once that didn't go well.	O
That was not a good day in tattoo shop.	O
You know because one thing you don't want to do in a tattoo shop is assault your tattoo artist because we are like a family and bad things would happen and this guy didn't see that coming.	O
He was drinking and he and his defense.	O
He was.	CHITCHAT
He he was one of those dude Bros where it's like you know like he you know that he was.	O
He was off his liquor and he was just, you know.	O
Toy around, he didn't actually lie.	O
Slap me, but he slapped me and I was just like Yo bro, we do it.	O
And before I knew it like he got dog piled.	O
By everybody in the shop and they got throughout the shop and didn't get his tattoo finished.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Because people like when he was like what you don't necessarily notice or what people don't notice is like if you're being belligerent in the shop or whatever, everyone is watching you.	O
You know, because there's you get get these get people that are acting out of character in tattoo shops all the time, you know?	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I used to always wonder why tattoo shops carried guns and stuff like that.	O
You know, it's because we don't have security an because people.	O
People have this thing in their brain where they can just pretty much do whatever they want, wherever, whatever do whatever they want wherever they want.	O
So you know of course, in a tattoo shop you got, you got people coming in and act like you know everybody knows that one person, that that gets a tattoo to show how tough they are, you know.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Like the worst thing in the world that I that I the one thing that I realized a lot is that when people come to tattoo shops to get tattooed, it's better for you not to bring people with you.	O
Because you act out of character an, another thing is like you don't miss testosterone with women you know.	O
So there were females in the shop and this is dude bro and you know he's.	O
Constantly talking about how tough he is and stuff like that.	O
And I'm just kind of like looking at this guy like OK, you know and he's like I could take you down and I'm like I don't like talking about high is going to be a USC.	O
Mixed martial artist and all that, and I'm just kind of like, you know, going along with it 'cause you get people like that all the time.	O
You know it's whatever you know, but you know he.	O
You know how most people are?	O
did I come on guy?	CHITCHAT
Come on man, just you know we could wrestle, we can go outside, wrestle and then like he just kind of tapped my face and that did not go well.	O
Not go with.	O
I feel bad for the dude because wo.	O
You know it was not good.	O
I was like Yo Yo Yo Yo you guys chill out you know like what they?	O
And if the code at the shop owner was like you don't have to ever take anything from anybody, he's like, you gotta understand that you're a tattoo artists and you don't work for these people.	O
He's like this.	O
It's, you know, I know that when you work in like regular shops or regular places that the client is always right.	O
Not here.	O
Like when you tattooed your job is to make their tattoo as beautiful as possible by any means necessary.	O
Don't take any crap.	O
And that was when I fell in love with tattooing.	O
They were like there's nowhere in tattooing in any industry in any shop that will make you take crap from a client that is being belligerent or whatever.	O
They're like you don't have to.	O
You don't have to kiss, but in this industry they were like you are when they when they come in and they talk to you, you are the manager of yourself because you are a private contractor, not granted.	O
You have to.	CHITCHAT
You have to construct yourself in a professional manner, but.	O
Being able to tell someone know and they're not right, man.	O
It's so liberating.	O
After years and years of service to be able to tell someone that is obviously going to be like I'm right, like you're not right, you're so wrong that it's unbelievable like you are not right.	O
And then they ask to speak to the manager, 'cause they do you know, and you are the manager.	O
Or or you get this.	O
I've had a client.	CHITCHAT
Like not.	CHITCHAT
I've never had a client would not agree with what I was doing, but I've had a client.	O
Like Not agree with the price.	O

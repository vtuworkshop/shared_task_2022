And want to change.	O
Tattoo artist like they agree with the prize.	O
Until I started and then they started being like.	O
Well, I don't necessarily want to pay this much because like they what happened was they wanted to quit and because they wanted to quit they thought they should get a discount because they didn't set the whole entire time.	O
And like I was explaining to them as we scheduled you for a certain amount of time.	O
I could if you weren't gonna sit, I could have scheduled someone else.	O
Behind you you scheduled yourself for that time because you don't because you didn't see it doesn't mean you don't.	O
You don't get you.	CHITCHAT
Don't get your money back.	O
You don't get a, It's not prorated, you know, use it.	O
Or you lose your money and the person was like Super Duper of sad and they wanted to speak to the manager and they wanted to change tattoo artist and it's like.	O
Which you don't necessarily understand is when you come into a tattoo shop, you make a binding contract with your tattoo artist.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Again, these things don't happen that often in tattooing 90% of the time it is a beautiful thing, you know.	O
But every now and again you get those people you know.	O
So anyways, she wanted to change and they let her know that you know you can change it if you're going to pay the new client in your new tattoo artist and the chick was like, well, no, he's going to give the other tattoo artist the money.	O
And I'm like, no, I'm not.	CHITCHAT
There's no, I couldn't finish your tattoo.	O
You don't want to sit because I can't take anymore and I need to come back and I'm like, well come back.	O
But you have to pay for another session and she was trying to get me to take the money that I had already that she had already gave me and put it toward the next session.	O
And I'm like, no.	O
This is for this.	O
She she couldn't get it, she just couldn't get it and I just was at the end of the day.	O
It was like you don't get your money back.	O
You can call the cops or whatever you want.	O
The cost will tell you the same thing.	O
'cause it says right there on the paperwork that all tattoos are non refundable.	O
You don't get your money back, you can't, you're not.	O
You not getting your money back once you pay the tattoo artist, you know 'cause you've had people we had.	O
We have.	O
I've been in shops where.	O
They have they have a policy where if the client isn't happy.	O
They get their money back.	O
They kept that all of a month and they reversed it because clients they don't understand that.	O
People in this world that though I love, I love this planet.	O
You know, people in this world give give the benefit of doubt it too many people we don't want to believe that people are as evil or as vindictive as they are an you try to give them the benefit of the doubt and get in and giving them the benefit of the doubt you end up getting yourself into a lot of trouble so you will have people come into your shop, get tattooed and say they don't like the tattoo even though they love it.	O
To get their money back, why the owner never thought about that was beyond me.	O
You know that for the first month, the owner actually was like you guys were losing money because you guys aren't making the clients happy and everybody's trying to tell him I do.	O
The clients which is lying because they don't want to pay and there this person was really like new to tattooing in there like no we just have to have trust in our clients and looks like do you have no idea what you're talking about?	O
You know like?	CHITCHAT
People literally do that stuff for no reason, like they're just making in like.	O
Finally, like we would, we would only bring our own people in.	O
It took it, took the IT took the owner.	O
It certainly order to start tattooing and having people say that to them for them to to for them to finally understand that you know people aren't as nice as you want them to be.	O
It would be nice to believe that the world is a good place and stuff like that, but and in the at the end of the day.	O
If you can, just tell someone you don't like a tattoo and get your money back, why wouldn't you do that?	O
You know, I was like I was like you could make that an unwritten rule, but don't tell you don't tell the clients that if they don't like their tattoo they get their money back.	O
There are people that literally just don't care.	O
They have no like I was trying to explain to him like there are people that literally just have no tax.	O
They actually don't care.	O
They really don't care about what other people think about them and they will come right in here and get you to tattoo them and then be like I don't like it.	O
I need my money back just like that.	O
And then you know, it's like you know.	O
Why would why would?	CHITCHAT
Why would a tattoo artist was the person was wondering why they kept losing good?	O
Are they got losing a lot of good artists, you know?	O
And it's like when.	O
You try to micromanage your tattoo artists.	O

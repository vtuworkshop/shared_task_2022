It causes a problem, and that's why, as as a young person you don't necessarily know that when you go into a tattoo shop.	O
When you want to tattoo shop, you're just like, yeah, I want to tattoo, you know, like I don't mean people getting a tattoo like he's like you know I want you want to be a tattoo.	O
Are you know someone is young tattoo artist just like yeah I just want to tattoo people you know I want to I want to I want to do tattoos and you know I just want to I want to get into this and I want to be I want to be famous and all of that stuff that gets you high for when you first go into a tattoo shop has become a tattoo artist.	O
Then you're warned about all of these things, you know.	O
That don't necessarily have to happen, but you supposed to plan for them to happen.	O
You know, like.	CHITCHAT
Shady owners and being like my mentality was I'm going to find one shop and I'm going to be at this shop forever because you know loyalty and all that good stuff that you pump into your head when you first walk into your shop and you're like, yeah, this is this is going to be my life shop.	O
You know this is where I'm going to be forever loyalty.	O
And then after a while you start realizing that.	O
And this is probably not going to workout because this person is doing this and this and this, and I'm not with that.	O
And why am I chart?	CHITCHAT
Why am I being charged more than this person and why?	O
And I'm doing more work?	O
And why is my booth smaller and why you keep moving me around?	O
And you know?	CHITCHAT
Why are you telling me I had a?	O
I had a I had a I had a tattoo shop owner try to tell me how I should charge because I was always under charging myself because I cared more about the artwork than I did about tattooing.	O
You know, I just was.	CHITCHAT
I was on my ego so I really, really really wanted to just tattoo people.	O
And one of the things that I would do is I would just bring people in and I would charge them like.	O
Two $300.	O
For like 1/2 sleeve you know so that I could get practicing.	O
And my shop owner did not like that.	O
Granted, I understand it that.	O
You know you in their brain is like we're getting a percentage of what you make.	O
Ideally, if you make more money.	O
We get more money too, but I was trying to explain to them like I'm trying to build up My Portfolio.	O
It's a business move.	O
Eventually I will make more money and we will make more money.	O
The tattoo shop owner was not trying to hear that there like no, you're gonna you're gonna start charging this because it's competitive rates and I was like you're not going to tell me what I'm going to charge.	O
I'm I paid, you know, like I'm paying you guys, you know off of what I tattoo you get your cut don't interfere with.	O
How I tattoo again a granite.	O
We got it.	CHITCHAT
We got into a big old fight, you know.	O
and I was like I'm just going to leave 'cause I'm not doing this.	O
So like you not gonna tell me how you're not going to tell me how I'm supposed to tattoo.	O
They just you just not, you know.	O
And the guy was like I'm going to be to you from the town and no one is going to hire you.	O
And I'm like man.	O
People in his town really think they have that kind of power.	O
'cause they know people and it's like you know people but you don't.	O
You don't run anything like people are going to make their own choices and stuff.	O
And it's like I'm like I'm like I'm not stupid enough to believe that someone is going to turn away a very good tattoo artist simply because some guy that they know says this person shouldn't be hired.	O
And yet they found out real quick that it just doesn't work like that.	O
You know, like they really want it to work like that, but I'm like it doesn't work like that.	O
It just it doesn't.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I finally found a place that I wanted to be.	O
I stayed there for a long time, you know.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Like One of the guys that worked in the shop ended up breaking off.	O
And going and starting their own shop, and I went with them and then it I started.	O
It started dawning on me that I don't necessarily want to work in a shop.	O
I realized after years of being in tattooing that what I actually just want.	O
It was the same thing I wanted from art where I literally just wanted a place to do tattoos for people that.	O
Didn't have to evolve around money and politics and all of that.	O
I just wanted to do tattoos because I love them so much that I didn't care about the money I wanted to be able to, you know, get my friends and have them come over an get tattooed, you know and get put in magazines and go to shows and I wanted to do all of this stuff that I saw when I first started tattooing.	O
For my art.	O
You know an I wasn't going to be able to do that in the shop because the shop was always.	O
And it's not a bad thing, but the shop is always going to be based around money because you know, you need money to keep the shop afloat.	O

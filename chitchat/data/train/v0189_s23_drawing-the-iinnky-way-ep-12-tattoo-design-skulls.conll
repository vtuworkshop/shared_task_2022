Yata Yata, Yata, so on and so forth.	CHITCHAT
That was when my ultimate goal was to have my own.	O
I wanted one master, one apprentice, you know, kind of like this it.	O
You know, like I literally only want one other person working with me, I thought my other apprentice was going to be that, but my other apprentice who is my Princess for Seven years, decided one day that she just didn't want to be a tattoo artist anymore.	O
She wanted to do something else, but I think it had a lot to do with.	O
She had a car accident, you know, an I think her back got messed up and she realized she wasn't going to be able to sit.	O
You know, because most tattoo artist end up having to get Cairo, having haven't.	O
End up having to go to a chiropractor because you're sitting all day, you know and you know as much as you want people to have a healthy lifestyle.	O
They generally don't, you know, and they generally just.	O
Live.	O
And tattooing is kind of like it's a fast paced lifestyle.	O
You know and.	O
With me I iconic.	O
I kinda got used to the whole.	O
You know, like I worked out a lot anyways, but I got I kind of got used to the whole.	O
You know you're gonna be working a lot of hours sitting in a certain position.	O
You know an I do that with drawing.	O
Anyways, I find myself doing a lot with drawing where I will draw for hours on end without moving and I don't think about it.	O
and I do that in tattooing and it's not good.	O
It's it's you.	CHITCHAT
You don't.	CHITCHAT
You really don't want to do that in tattooing.	O
You need to be like very mobile.	O
You know you need to get up and take breaks.	O
You need to move around, but because you you.	O
You start getting a hunch and you start hunting over and you start filling.	O
Like You don't notice it until you stand up and you can't stand you.	O
It's hard to stand up straight, you know or like 'cause when you're sitting in your your normal position, like when your tattoo when you're sitting kinda like this.	O
It's comfortable.	O
You don't want that to be your comfort position.	O
I don't know if anybody ever ever has that happen to them when they do drawing or art, but if your comfort present position is sitting like this while you're doing work	O
You're starting your starting to get your starting to ruin your posture.	O
You know it will cause back problems when you have to do simple things like.	O
I don't know, walk.	O
You know, because you are now sitting in this hunched over position.	O
You know, and you're not.	O
And that's what you do for hours on end.	O
You don't.	CHITCHAT
You don't necessarily want that.	O
Kind of like.	O
You don't want that kind of like a.	O
Health.	O
Like issue when you get holther you don't.	O
You don't necessary.	O
You don't necessarily want to have to deal with that kind of stuff when you get older, you definitely want to make it where it's not.	O
You don't.	CHITCHAT
You want you want to be able to move freely for as long as possible.	O
And you know, like.	O
Once you get into it and you start loving it, you just kind of forget about it.	O
So again, if you guys if this the first time here guys like I'm making a full skull sleeve so this is pretty much I'm going to hide skulls all in it now again, it's gonna wrapped completely around.	O
So all of these areas right here.	O
I will find ways to like extended and add to it and things like that, but for the most part these are all the skull I've added so far.	O
They will be the basis of what I'm going to be doing.	O
Let me see I think I want to put in eye here, but I don't want that I to be.	O
I don't want that either show too much, I just want it to be known that there is one there.	O
Is going to have it kind of go with this smoke?	O
I don't want to overdo it either.	O
The goal of this entire piece is to make.	O
The entire piece look like.	O
Kind of Smokey but where the skulls are?	O
They'll be a lot.	O
There would be a lot more detail in the skulls, but it still has that Smokey like flow to it.	O
And we just hide this were just hiding skulls and all the different areas and stuff like that.	O
As many as we can fit.	O
In as many as many different places and you just basically just keep pushing the envelope or whatnot, so you can't, you know.	O
It is definitely good, is definitely a good practice for artists because you know organic type tattoos are really fun to do and trying to fit things in small spaces actually helps teach you about filigree and stuff like that and function way and things that you don't think you necessarily would need to know for tattooing if you're going to design tattooed.	O

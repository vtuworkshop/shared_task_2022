Again, this is more so for people that want to design a tattoo, not get tattooed.	O
Because a lot of people are just kind of like.	O
They a lot of people aren't very aren't very well.	O
Verse.	O
On how building a tattoo works and you get you get a lot of you get a lot of bad designs.	O
And of course if you have a bad design, you know which, which in tattooing is an art in any, since it's hard to recognize because it's an Ida beholder, but if you get a bad design or a designer, just overall isn't going to be liked.	O
Your basically polishing a turd if you basically put it in really well, you can.	O
Actually you can actually apply a tattoo very well.	O
Right, but the tattoo still looks like garbage.	O
You know, like it's designed like garbage.	O
You know it's just going to be garbage, you know.	O
But I mean the client likes it.	O
Then what can you say?	O
You know, but if you, if you're designing, imagine if a client brings you something this like just.	O
Could be so much better, right?	O
But you just put it in and you do it super good.	O
You know, like it's still the composition in every end of Design is still going to be bad, you know.	O
Like, imagine if you could have made it better now again, if it's if it's.	O
You know if grandma, druid or grandpa, druid or somebody did it that actually had a lot of sentimental value to it, right?	O
You can't really argue with that, right?	O
You know like that's different, but if it's just, this is what I came up with an you can help change that.	O
You should probably be trying to change it.	O
You should not be used to.	O
Definitely not let that existed the way that it is.	O
It will come back to bite you in the butt one day.	O
You have to actually do something about it, because when you get older and tattooing and you start looking at the stuff that you did, you will actually be like man.	O
I should have totally did this different.	O
You know that I do that a lot.	O
I look at stuff I do a lot and be like Oh my God.	O
I didn't do that.	O
I would have totally done that different had I did that today.	O
You know, and that's kind of like.	CHITCHAT
You don't want to feel that way where it's like, Oh man, oh, I would have totally did that differently, you know?	O
Is going to happen, but you don't want to feel that way, you know.	O
'cause with anything that you learn you have, you have the learning curve.	O
You're not just going to be able to jump in and just be really good at something.	O
You're definitely going to have to.	O
Figure out how to make everything work you know, and I guess that's like one of the hardest things like how am I going to make this work?	O
About really sure how I'm going to go about doing this or how I'm going to like when I did a tattoo like this along time ago.	O
An embalmed.	O
I didn't tattoo it on anybody but I should divide designed it and it bombed because I had no idea what I was doing and I was just trying to do something that I thought would work.	O
It did not, it it.	CHITCHAT
It did not work and I did and I was so ego driven that I convinced myself.	O
Which we do this alot.	O
Don't do this.	O
I convinced myself that what did not work was actually working.	O
'cause you stare at your piece along time.	O
Which is why people tell you should get up.	O
And walk around when you tattoo or get up and walk away from your piece that you're working on and come back to it because you will literally talk yourself into believing that something that you're doing as bad is actually good.	O
You know people do that a lot and we don't even realize it.	O
And it's like do you got it?	O
You got to get up and walk away from what you're doing.	O
The last thing you want is to sit there and convince yourself that something you're doing is good and it's horrible.	O
You know an I'm I'm a big, big, big, big big, like advocated that 'cause I used to be I used to be that I used to do that.	O
Get up and walk away for an hour.	O
Come back and look at your peace and see if it still looks the same way.	O
'cause I can look at this right now.	O
Now again, is the full sleeve full of random skulls, and I'll get up and be like Oh my God, I just killed it.	O
Gonna be such a good tattoo and then I come back later and be like what the?	O
Did someone touch my someone touched my drawing tablet 'cause I did not draw this.	O
Who did that?	O
You know, like you just completely forget that you know you did something that you did because you come back later, and it's like that does not look good.	O
What was I thinking about, you know?	O
So you know, I've done that a lot where I went to sleep thinking man, this idea is going to kill what it's done and then you get up the next morning and it's like, Yikes, I don't know how I'm going to recover from this.	O

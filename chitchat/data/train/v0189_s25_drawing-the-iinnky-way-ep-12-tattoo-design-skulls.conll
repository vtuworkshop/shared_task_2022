You know, it's like you get these.	O
You start realizing that you know.	O
You hype yourself up a lot, you know, and a lot of times when you do that, you tend to tend to overthink a lot of stuff.	O
You definitely don't want to do that.	O
Do I want to?	CHITCHAT
I kind of want to put another I hear.	O
Actually I do.	O
I want to put another I right here.	O
Maybe a little closer.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Well, I know what I'm aiming for on 'cause I want to put another.	O
I here and then I want to put.	O
Another skull here.	O
Or like another, yeah?	O
'cause I wanted to kind of rap around the arm.	O
But I'm also thinking too, I want it here 'cause I got one upside.	O
I got these two.	O
I got one facing.	O
So if you look really closely this skull is connected to this skull, you know.	O
And then another thing I think I will I was gonna do like a third one kind of coming off to the side.	O
It looks good in theory.	O
Now again when this wraps around the body.	O
This might actually wrapped around to the other side, and then it might not work.	O
You know, that's kind of what I'm thinking about right now.	O
Is like drawing it out.	O
Yeah, they look really cool until I put it on the body and then it doesn't work.	O
And then you're like, Oh now I could do exactly what I did up here where I could just kind of put him face into the side, but then that would that would kind of in frame it, which is what I don't want.	O
I don't want it to be.	O
I don't want to frame it.	O
As generally where it comes out, Nessus doubt now.	O
The reason why I'm doing this is because.	O
There's going to be a large.	O
There's going to be a lot of open space here on this side.	O
I could just put smoke, but then I would still have to hide.	O
Pieces of fragments of skulls and stuff like that in there, you know.	O
A lot of things you don't want to do is like or what I'm trying to avoid doing is making a lot of skulls face the same way.	O
You know I want them to be in there, but I also I also want them to not be all the same direction.	O
It needs to seem like I'm building up to something.	O
You know, if I have like these, if I have two schools facing this way is going to make it look weird.	O
If I have, you know, like I'm trying to balance it out and make it kind of, you know.	O
Do its thing.	O
So let's see.	O
Oh no guys and girls would you guys like to see me do more tattoo designs here 'cause normally what I usually do is I do test she's 4.	O
Characters and stuff like that that you guys can recommend.	O
I have my discord at the bottom of the screen where you can basically recommend anything that I draw on stream, and I usually pick from there.	O
Just join the discord going to the room labeled sketch requests and put what you would like to see me draw.	O
It doesn't matter what you put, I generally draw.	O
I generally pull ideas from there.	O
I didn't necessarily have any ideas, so I decided to do work.	O
On stream kabob, my actual tattoo artist.	O
The other thing you gotta realize, like once this is done, this is pretty much what the design is going to look like.	O
You know, and I know it's kind of hard to see I said I'll make it easier for you guys to see it.	O
So this is generally what the design is going to look like.	O
Now as a regular design, it looks like a cluttered mess, but when you put it on an arm it starts together form and it starts to make sense, plus is going to wrap around.	O
So with all the values put into it it everything will pop out and fade away and it will it will.	O
It will gather it will gather the attention that I'm actually trying to bring to each one.	O

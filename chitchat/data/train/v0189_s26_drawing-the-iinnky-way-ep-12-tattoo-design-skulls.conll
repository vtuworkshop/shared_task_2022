Now, granted, these aren't detailed out skills, I'm going to go in and put massive amounts of detail in these goals.	O
I won't do that when I stencil it.	O
Which is why the stencil is going to be on a different layer on a different layer.	O
I'm just going to do the basics for the skulls.	O
And then you stencil it.	O
You do it, you do all the detail.	O
Why extensively?	O
Because I mean, I know what kind of detail I wanted.	O
My skulls, stuff like that.	O
Generally.	CHITCHAT
I can show you guys I did one I did one like.	O
Couple weeks ago on my son's leg.	O
It was one of these.	O
One of these it was this one at the bottom.	O
And the I made sure I didn't put that much.	O
Work into the.	O
Into the stencil.	O
So that I can later on add more detail into it and it's like if you do.	O
If you show people exactly what their stuff is going to look like from the beginning, a lot of times they get bored with it, you know, or that doesn't wow them.	O
What you want to do is wow your client.	O
You show them a basic sketch and then you give them.	O
Two to three times better than what they expect.	O
You know this is this is an image of one of the skills that I did.	O
You know, schools are basic, like I don't really think that anybody should be wowed by skulls.	O
You know, it's like their skulls is whatever but.	O
You should still put in the same effort you would put in something like that as you would on something you like.	O
You don't just phone it in because it's not, you know something that you you know feel like should be.	O
You know you know like a lot of people, a lot of people don't.	O
They feel like if there, if it's not something that they want to do, it shouldn't be.	O
You know you shouldn't really, you know.	O
Put that much emphasis on it, but like you should put the same emphasis on something small as you do.	O
Want some big put the effort in no matter what.	O
You know, and I get a lot of people that just really don't.	O
They really don't feel like they should be put in that much effort on something that they just don't care about.	O
That I'm trying to.	O
Not get caught up in there.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
I'm definitely trying to make it where.	O
When I draw or I do anything I put, I put maximum effort into everything.	O
'cause it's very it is very easy to be like.	O
I don't care, I'm I'm.	O
I'm not trying to do this, you know.	O
And then just kinda like.	O
Not putting like like basically just kind of trying to get through it and then ended up doing something really bad that could have been really good and then the client has to live with that forever.	O
That's the thing that I was constantly think about is like I'm a tattoo artist.	O
Whenever I put on the client it's going to be on their skin forever.	O
I'm not going to do something to someone scan.	O
That's going to be on them forever, and they're going to have to live with it forever.	O
Just 'cause of my ego, or because I didn't feel like it that day.	O
It's something that I actually really, really, really really stress a lot when it comes to people getting tattooed is like yo don't.	O
If you don't feel like cats when that day, just don't tattoo, don't go in tattoo someone and then.	O
Have them get stuck with something that you did.	O
And you weren't ready to do or you were proud of doing for the rest of their life because of you.	O
Know whenever you felt like that morning?	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
I've actually rescheduled tattoos.	O
I frequently because I just.	O
Didn't feel you know I actually had a client that was actually done.	O
I don't recommend doing this at all, but if you have to.	O
But I had a client that actually had a tattoo scheduled that day and I just didn't feel like doing a tattoo anymore and I gave the client their money back.	O
It was like I can't.	O
I just, I don't I I recommended him to a new tattoo artist, you know?	O
They got their tattoo done, but I didn't want to do it 'cause I just didn't feel up to doing it anymore because I just I couldn't figure out.	O
How to make the peace.	O
Something that I liked.	O
You know, and I worked on all the way up until that morning when that client was supposed to come in and I was like I just can't figure it out.	O
I just don't like the way this is looking.	O
I don't know if it's me, you know, I could have easily just did what I what I had drawn, but I was like, no, I don't want to do it.	O
I just don't want to do it.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
And I basically said the person to another another tattoo artist.	O
That ultimately did their design and then they were happy and everything worked out.	O
The cloud wasn't happy that day, you know they were kind of but they were happy in the end because they got what they wanted an now that client an that artist there.	O
It continues to go to that artist, which is good for them, 'cause the weighted with that client wanted I couldn't fulfill and I just didn't want to be that guy.	O

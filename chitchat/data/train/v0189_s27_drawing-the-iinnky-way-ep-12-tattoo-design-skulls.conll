And sometimes sometimes you have to let things go.	O
You know, like I know, a lot of client.	O
I'm not attach towards like I'm not going to.	O
They will not let their clients get away from him.	O
'cause they don't.	CHITCHAT
You know, they feel like they don't know when they're going to get more clients or me.	O
I feel like the work that I do in the constant effort that I put in.	O
I don't and it's not.	O
It's not generally the only thing that I have in my life going for me that I will be fine, you know.	O
For you know I would be completely fine sending this person to another tattoo artist.	O
Rather than trying to like keep them there just for the sake of losing.	O
You know money.	O
That's a hard thing to learn 'cause the old me would have been like, no way there's no way I'm letting you could no way, no way I'm sending you to another artist you're crazy I'm just going to do this.	O
Really bad design that I'm not happy with, you know, but I'm not going to let you go.	O
But like after a while you just you understand it's bigger than that.	O
You know, like there's a lot of.	O
There's a lot of things that factor in two tattooing that you when you first start out you don't think about.	O
Are more than likely going to be continuing working on this if I don't finish it off stream or whatever.	O
But I'm glad you guys got to sit here and see the the competition.	O
The composition of this, and generally what a tattoo artist does.	O
Now I worked on this generally a lot faster than I work.	O
On other ones, you know, sometimes it's just a lot of sitting there and contemplating.	O
Whether or not this is going to work and how this is going to workout, how you going to spin this in this direction in you know, like it's not, this is a lot more organic, so you don't necessarily think about it a lot, but a lot of tattoos aren't.	O
Really organic, you know, a lot of amuse you struggle through a lot of them like the designs anyways.	O
You know once you get to design down the rest of it is easy to like.	O
That's what I keep trying to tell people when it comes to tattooing is like the hard part.	O
Starts before the client actually gets there.	O
The hardest part of your tattoo is before the client ever actually set foot into the shop.	O
And they're always like Y and it's like, well, simply because you're designing their tattoo and you bake all the frustration is coming is in your life as far as his tattoo are coming.	O
It's coming right now with you creating something.	O
I'm not a skull person, but it turned out really cool.	O
Yeah, I'm hoping it's not.	O
It's far from done.	O
I will definitely.	CHITCHAT
I will definitely show you guys the finished product.	O
If you're here.	O
Follow the channel if you haven't already.	CHITCHAT
I will show you if I don't.	CHITCHAT
If I don't finish it on stream, I will definitely show you the finished product on the next stream so you guys know what it looked like.	O
But more than likely I'll probably finish it on stream.	O
I may pop back in later on today.	O
But if not I think I want to do.	O
I'll do these periodically when I have nothing else to draw.	O
I still want to keep to format where, but I think it's always nice to show people what I do for a living.	O
This is one of my many jobs.	O
And this is the one that I love the most.	O
This is what I will probably do until my fingers stopped working.	O
And yeah, I also share as much knowledge as I can.	O
If you guys have any questions about art in or tattooing I will answer anything because I know there are people out there that.	CHITCHAT
Are striving to be tattoo artists are struggling with questions and if I can answer my will I'm not I am a self taught artist, so every answer I give you is based on a self taught artists.	CHITCHAT
Mentality.	CHITCHAT
You know, I know, it's really hard to understand when you speak too highly trained artists and stuff like that.	O
So sometimes you need to hear from somebody who doesn't have all of that knowledge and you get it more and get it more layman's terms.	O
I guess you can say where it's just more basic.	O
You know 'cause I've had a lot of times where I have been.	O
Trying to explain something or trying to like I've been trying to get information from somebody an I couldn't necessarily understand what they were explaining, 'cause they had all this training and they were doing the teachers.	O

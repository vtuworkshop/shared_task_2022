Version.	O
Of what?	O
You would learn you know, like they use the big words and all that stuff like you know, like juxtaposition and all that.	O
And I'm just like I, I don't.	O
I don't understand.	O
You know it's like I just I just want things to be simple put mine here draw a line there you know like I'm really basic when it comes to that kind of stuff.	O
But yeah, I'll be.	O
I'll be more than happy to show you guys the finished product.	O
The finished design.	O
This is going to take a long time.	O
do I sell art?	CHITCHAT
No, except for tattooing is a good question.	CHITCHAT
I do not sell art.	CHITCHAT
I give it away except for tattoo designs because it's work.	CHITCHAT
But anything you ever see me do on this channel like stuff like this stuff will not.	CHITCHAT
These are tattoo designs but like.	CHITCHAT
The testes and things that I do on the channel like this stuff like this, uhm.	CHITCHAT
I think the last one I did was a leader.	CHITCHAT
Any art that you see me do outside.	CHITCHAT
Of tattooing I give away.	CHITCHAT
It's in my discord.	CHITCHAT
I don't sell art.	CHITCHAT
Tattooing is what I do for a living and people are like how do you make money and I'm like Well you know.	CHITCHAT
If you want to join my patriotic support.	CHITCHAT
Me and keep me doing free art.	CHITCHAT
That's how you know, like tattooing pays my bills so everything else that I do is basically donation based or subscription based.	CHITCHAT
I also stream on Twitch under Inc one which is nothing but you know what?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I stream on Twitch under each one.	CHITCHAT
And pretty much under Twitch is what I usually do.	CHITCHAT
All of my.	CHITCHAT
Original I try to do original type art.	CHITCHAT
I try to do tattoo art stuff like that or just talk a lot.	CHITCHAT
They can subscribe there.	CHITCHAT
All of that stuff.	CHITCHAT
You know, like I mean, I just don't really want to sell art.	CHITCHAT
It makes it so much easier for me because Commission work is a pain in the butt.	CHITCHAT
I'm not trying to discourage anybody from doing a Commission work.	CHITCHAT
Commission work is great, you know.	CHITCHAT
But I.	CHITCHAT
Can only deal with clients when it comes to tattooing, which is why I love this because clients can't tell you how to do a tattoo.	CHITCHAT
But if you're doing a Commission for a client, they know what they want already, and I need a little bit more control over what I do.	CHITCHAT
You know, I still want.	CHITCHAT
I still want the clients input, but I want to be.	CHITCHAT
I want to have free range over what I do, so I when I draw things like this.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Like things like this, I draw and I just give away like that, but when I drop things like this I want.	CHITCHAT
I want them to be able to.	CHITCHAT
I want to be able to do what I want to do.	CHITCHAT
So like when I draw stuff like this.	CHITCHAT
This is generally what you get a lot of on this channel.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to sell this.	CHITCHAT
This is fan art.	CHITCHAT
I didn't create this, I've I just.	CHITCHAT
Anything that's connected to fan art or something like that I.	CHITCHAT
Don't necessarily want to sail.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to sell it.	CHITCHAT
My whole goal is to get people to get better at art.	CHITCHAT
And if this is what it takes to get you to pick up your pencils and rock, as I've noticed that when people come into channels and they're watching streamers that draw really good and there an artist they typically want to draw along with the streamer.	CHITCHAT
All I want you to do is pick up your pencil, then draw.	CHITCHAT
And if you enjoy the art and you can, you can afford to drop a couple of dollars or whatever.	CHITCHAT
And my Patriot or anything like that do so.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise it's not expected.	CHITCHAT
But to answer your question, no, I don't sell art and less is tattoo it.	CHITCHAT
You can have it anything that I draw on my channel is going to be in my discord because I draw everyday for the sole purpose of just getting better.	CHITCHAT
So another reason why don't start I don't sell art because most people will say that I'm good enough to sell art.	CHITCHAT
But anybody that's an artist knows that it doesn't necessarily matter what other people think is what you think about your artwork.	CHITCHAT
and I don't think what I don't think how I want to represent myself.	CHITCHAT
Is what I'm doing right now, except for tattooing of course.	CHITCHAT
Like as far as like regular art like in like fan art and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to, you know.	CHITCHAT
I draw a lot of Waifus and stuff like that and sexy women off stream.	CHITCHAT
For people that are in my community that want that kind of stuff, but I don't post that kind of stuff, it's usually just in my disk.	CHITCHAT
Patriotic.	CHITCHAT
Because it's by request, but now I don't really.	CHITCHAT

People typically only want to see if you can do it, and I'm OK with that, so yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
But for real, you really inspiring and you definitely got me a warm up.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy to hear that is all I really want.	CHITCHAT
That's it.	CHITCHAT
That's all I really want.	CHITCHAT
And I'm glad that you're here, and I'm glad that I'm glad that you like the community, and I hope that you tune in as often as possible.	CHITCHAT
Ask any questions you want, but no.	CHITCHAT
In all seriousness, if you actually want me to Draw Something for you, put it in a discord.	CHITCHAT
I don't have a problem with doing it.	CHITCHAT
I really don't, and you don't have to pay for it.	CHITCHAT
If you enjoy the stream and you want to keep it going, you know there are multiple facets where you can support me.	CHITCHAT
Or not.	CHITCHAT
It's up to you.	CHITCHAT
I'm old, my ultimate goal is to get better.	CHITCHAT
So that my ultimately so much so I can have something to leave for my son.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause he's an artist and if I if for any reason I am ever to not be here, you know.	CHITCHAT
He will have something to guide him long after I'm gone or any any any future.	CHITCHAT
Artists or any future artists in my family.	CHITCHAT
You know they can use what I leave behind as a stepping stone or something to help them.	CHITCHAT
They may or may not want to do this kind of Art.	CHITCHAT
You know, that's why I draw multiple things.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
And I've done painting in all of these different things.	CHITCHAT
But I think that's going to wrap it up for today.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm gonna.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to go ahead and set up and contemplate on this a little bit more.	O
And then I'm going to detail the heck out of it.	O
And then we're going to call it.	O
We're going to send it to the client and let the client tell us whether or not they like it or not.	O
'cause that's the hardest part is getting getting it all done and then sending it to the client and the client.	O
Being like I love it.	O
But then they change it.	O
You know which is.	O
Which is just a part of it.	O
It's the part that I love.	O
But if they change it, that means that this becomes a separate design.	O
And then we make a new design.	O
So now I have two designs and I could do things with and stuff like that, you know.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I try to be as live as possible.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to increase the amount of times that I stream 'cause right now usually stream like twice a week, but I'm going to up that because I'm basically basing my streams around work I stream.	CHITCHAT
I tattoo full time and I also have a 12 by 12 hour a day job where I make coins.	CHITCHAT
Don't ask me about the coin job 'cause it is definitely not permanent.	CHITCHAT
It is temporary 'cause the pandemic and I'm happy to have a job so.	CHITCHAT
And it's funding everything that I want to do for my streaming and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, well yeah.	CHITCHAT
I mean I will if you follow my if you if you.	CHITCHAT
I think you can hit the button, they'll give you notifications when I go live and stuff like that, but typically I usually stream when I stream on.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Be hands I usually stream really late at night or around this time or I use the stream more toward the afternoon.	CHITCHAT
My time, which is like Pacific Standard Time, but I appreciate everybody coming out.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate those you guys.	CHITCHAT
They stayed in Watts.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate those you guys stay tuned in.	CHITCHAT
I will be working on this more.	CHITCHAT
I if I if I decided I'm going to put a lot more detail into it, I'll probably just pop in and do it another stream.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm off all day, so if I decide that I wanted.	CHITCHAT
Really, really dig into this.	CHITCHAT
I'll just turned.	CHITCHAT
I'll just turn the screen back on and go back into it so that you guys don't miss a thing you know.	CHITCHAT
But I do appreciate you guys all coming out.	CHITCHAT
I will see you guys next time.	CHITCHAT
Follow me on all social media platforms that you can.	CHITCHAT

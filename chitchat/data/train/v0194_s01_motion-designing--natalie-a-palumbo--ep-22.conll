I'm a train motion graphic designer and if this is your first time tuning in, welcome and if you're returning from a prior broadcast.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for tuning back in.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be sharing my creative process for a social media promo that I'm putting together for New York New Jersey Metro Band.	O
The Black ties.	O
So let's get started.	O
So for those of you that aren't familiar with my process, I'm working on a one minute social media promo featuring a cover.	O
The black ties did of Hallelujah.	O
I love her.	CHITCHAT
So by Ray Charles and happens to be one of my favorite songs from the classic rock era.	O
But this video is meant to go on any other social media platforms.	O
So Facebook, Instagram, whatever the preferences and, um, typically these promos are more film based.	O
But for the purposes of these live streams, I wanted to include A and effects animation element to each clip.	O
So with that said, I'm going to show you the current progress that I've made so far.	O
Weather Oh Awesome.	CHITCHAT
How do you?	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Dude.	CHITCHAT
Pandora.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
So as you can see, it's sort of progressed as I've been working in these on the live streams.	O
The overall approach, depending on what the focus is in each clip because each one is different.	O
Just for clarity, I all the video that you see here shop by me at different venues of the same song, Um.	O
One thing I've been doing recently is I've been doing something called pickups, where I'll go back to an earlier clip that I worked on, and, uh, seeing what I can do to enhance the visuals a little bit more.	O
So let me take a look at this timeline here.	O
I think I know which clip I want to use.	O
It's just a matter of.	O
Figuring out the comp number, there's so many now that I have to sort of backtrack and figure out which one correlate's with which clip.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Give me 1 second.	CHITCHAT
That's why I wanted to work on.	O
So it's not #9 OK.	O
Easy enough.	O
Just gotta find it.	O
There's over 30 now.	O
If you can believe that.	O
Now it's been awhile, so I'm not sure how it's set up exactly from the last time I worked on it, so I might have to adjust it in some way, but.	O
I'll cross that bridge when I get to it.	O
'cause I like the effect, but I think it needs to be revealed in a different way.	O
I don't know if I'm gonna keep the UM.	O
The overall colors on the guitars though.	O
By the way, if you're wondering why my hair is all.	O
It's why my hair is up.	O
I was actually filming them earlier today for a video.	O
I'm going to be working on.	O
And, uh, because it was 90 degrees he in 90 degrees Fahrenheit.	O
At the time when I was going out filming them, my hair had to be pulled up so my mom is a stylist and she came up with this little hair do for Maine where some of its pulled up and there's some I had a couple of both from a colleague of mine back at Ringling.	O
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
So I decided to use those to clip it in place and it ended up being really nice, so I just kept it.	O
Alright, now where is that clip?	O

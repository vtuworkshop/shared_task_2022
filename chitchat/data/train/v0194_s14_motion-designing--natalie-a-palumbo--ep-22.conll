It's funny when it all combines based around the same color.	O
It feels more immersive.	O
It feels more cohesive.	O
'cause before I didn't have that color adjustment, but afterwards it did.	O
Feel like kind of.	O
Like there's the power coming off the instrument.	O
That's, uh.	CHITCHAT
Helping it glow just a little bit more.	O
Yeah, I think I'm pretty happy with the adjustment of this effect.	O
I am going to play with the colour correction on the guitar just a little bit, see what I can do about.	O
Having the burst revealed a little bit more.	O
But some, if it doesn't necessarily work, I am happy with how this looks.	O
So all right?	O
I'm trying to figure out which one will affect.	O
Oh, I was just working on it.	O
What do I doing OK?	O
OK, that's the actual this.	O
The layer we want.	O
This one right here.	O
Nice.	O
Although that two dark, I feel like that's two dark.	O
Alright, maybe make it 75.	O
Negative 75.	O
Yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So we see a little bit of the detailing, but it's not so overt that.	O
Although I don't know if that works, but This is why working in a non destructive platform is the best thing for adjustments like this.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think I like that.	CHITCHAT
'cause you sort of faintly see the textures and then when the burst comes in you clearly see what it is.	O
Kind of like being, uh.	O
Illuminated in the shadows.	O
But on a guitar and in broad daylight.	O
In a manner of speaking.	O
I'm going to take a look at the rest of the footage and see what I can do to warm up the color tones with those, but.	O
Yeah, this one looks pretty good.	O
Alright, so one thing I started doing with the later clips is I did an overall color adjustment to the footage just to give it a little more warmth than it had previously, because when I did start with these I mostly focused on.	O
Black and white with a color for the animation.	O
As a follow through motif, but as I kept working on it, I thought that maybe there should be some cream tones introduced to the footage.	O
Just to give it a little more warmth.	O
An other things.	O
In addition to that, but as a starter.	O
OK, that's good to start with.	O
It's really nice what it does to the colors.	O

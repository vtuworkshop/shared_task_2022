Lawlessly right communicate verbally.	CHITCHAT
Any of those?	CHITCHAT
It's just.	CHITCHAT
You bridge so many gaps in communication and understanding.	CHITCHAT
When you take the time to know more than one language, I think.	CHITCHAT
Like I, I'm actually conversational in French, and there were circumstances where I had to use it as what was known as a trade language where one person knows one native language in the other person has their own native language, but they both know the same language.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's not their native language, but their conversational in it, and they use that in what's called a trade language.	CHITCHAT
And I've had to use it before with a couple of people.	CHITCHAT
I like the blue streaking across.	O

Ahead or behind us in terms of time zones.	CHITCHAT
I want to say you're ahead.	CHITCHAT
But I'm not certain.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's see.	CHITCHAT
I think the glow needs to be brought out a little bit more.	O
Not so bright that it's over, you know, overpowering the drums, but definitely brighter.	O
At least figure out how to do it.	O
So you now writes, I'm a boy.	CHITCHAT

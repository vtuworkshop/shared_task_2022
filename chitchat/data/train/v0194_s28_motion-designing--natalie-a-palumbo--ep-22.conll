So.	CHITCHAT
I hear a Jingle Bell in the hallway.	CHITCHAT
My rescue cat is.	CHITCHAT
Hello hello he just wondering here.	CHITCHAT
So what are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
I remember what happened the last time, Jeremy.	CHITCHAT
You silly silly goose.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
In the middle of a broadcast honey, I know, I know, I love you too.	CHITCHAT
Jeremy decided to, uh.	CHITCHAT
Come and say Hello, I am not sure what he's doing.	CHITCHAT
He must, with the webcam the last time.	CHITCHAT
Not that I mind it, it was funny.	CHITCHAT
Oh, they wrote and said my job is the same as yours is fantastic.	CHITCHAT
It's a wonderful field to be in a you can go so many directions with motion design.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, you can involve composite ING's own compositing.	O
With it you can.	O
Two purely projection mapping.	O
You can do just.	O
A 2D cell style graphics or really detailed visual effects work.	O
It's broad and that's wonderful about it.	O
I'm gonna darken up blue so it really it like it's more of a Royal blue, but it matches the drumsticks.	O
I won't do lighting effects.	O
Well, lighting can be as simple as a color correction on a project, or it could be.	O
Really elaborate like you're having to adjust the lighting on a model or an animation in a 3D program like.	O
Let's say you're working in cinema.	O
So I understand, you know, if your if your preferences something else involving motion graphics entirely, that's fine.	O
It's a good thing to find out those things.	O
'cause the process is so broad.	O
Anyway, you have people that are specialized in certain parts of the process so.	O
While you may not be inclined to do one part, even though you have to know it in order to be trained.	O
You can know every other step of the process and find out what you really enjoy.	O
My goal was to get strong in all areas of motion design.	O
That way I could handle any project that was handed to me.	O
You essentially we were taught to be problem solvers.	O
I think that looks a lot more subtle.	O
I might add of another photo filter just to.	O
To override the brightness a little bit more.	O
What is it?	CHITCHAT
Do you need something?	CHITCHAT
You totally want attention, don't you?	CHITCHAT
So I read you just said, can I see your cat?	CHITCHAT
But I don't know if he's gonna let me hold him but.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I knew something.	CHITCHAT

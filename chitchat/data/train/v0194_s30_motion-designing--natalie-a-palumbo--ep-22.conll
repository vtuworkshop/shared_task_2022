Hello.	CHITCHAT
I do like that darker blue.	O
Let me see what I can do here.	O
Silly.	O
My even.	O
I think that blue looks a lot nicer.	O
'cause it it matches?	O
Oh I receive rights.	O
Lovely thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you iris.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I think it creates a nice sense of balance.	O
The focus is still definitely on the drumsticks, which are the brightest thing in scene.	O
But there's a little more of a vibrance to the drum kit itself.	O
So I think beyond this I can do some color corrections and I think this one will be properly adjusted or readjusted as a pick up.	O
What do you do?	CHITCHAT
It no don't don't bust.	CHITCHAT
Jeremy is decided to interrupt the whole broadcast.	CHITCHAT
You are so silly.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to check chirping at him hold on guys.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
No honey, I have to brush.	CHITCHAT
He's biting my hand journey.	CHITCHAT
He just wants attention.	CHITCHAT
He such a silly for both the 100 con rights matter fact thank you, by the way, if I'm if I'm pronouncing your name during the broadcast, for anybody that's just tuning in, let me know if I'm pronouncing it correctly out of respect to anybody that is taking the time to write in the chat as thoughtful questions.	CHITCHAT
Just let me know.	CHITCHAT
OK, now I'm going to do some color effects.	O
For those of you that are tuning in that we're here for the first part, uh, when I was working on the 1st pick up, I like to reintroduce some warm tones to the footage because the color tones get desaturated.	O
To create a sense of emphasis on the animations which all revolve around the blue color scheme.	O
So the first thing I like to do is I like to reintroduce those warm tones.	O
Using selective color which has a little more control over where those colors appear.	O
In this case I wanted to show up in the neutral tones.	O
And the the light tones.	O
Actually, I think I liked it better.	O
Yeah?	CHITCHAT
Well, more balanced that way.	O
I think it'll look.	O
You look much better once I adjust the whites of the lights of the footage.	O
I'm also going to do some contrast just a little more.	O
Emphasis contrast.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I I don't know do I need to put this over or under?	O
I think they're more vibrant under.	O
Then over see depending on the arrangement.	O
Oh oh.	CHITCHAT
Uh, that how Durkan thank you for following me.	CHITCHAT
They are the harder con followed up and said they actually fanatically wrote out their name.	O
And said my name is pronounced this way.	CHITCHAT
Well, thank you for letting me know Anne.	CHITCHAT
If I did miss pronounce it before, uh, I'm glad you followed up and gave me the right pronunciation.	CHITCHAT
So thank you for qualifying that.	CHITCHAT

Oh, a shabby on Valenzuela Valenzuela.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for following me.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
And then from attic.	O
Apparition.	O
Now again, like we did before.	O
We don't want the distortion of the blur, just the colors.	O
It makes you feel like you're looking through the.	O
The eye of a camera lens like the viewer.	O
This is more of a natural feel to it.	O
It also reminds me of those.	O
I don't know if anyone else had this experience in science class, but there was one project where we were given these little triangular prisms an if you rotate a certain way, you start to see the.	O
Um, the color spectrum Rays of light start to break apart and it creates this really cool chromatic aberration effects.	O
Especially when you try it.	O
When you put your camera lens up against it, and I used to do that all the time.	O
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
So I love playing with that so.	O
That that plug-in being available is a wonderful villain footage and this is fun to play around with any way it breaks apart.	O
The colors ever so slightly depending on how you use it, it can be extreme or it can be subtle now I prefer subtle with adding certain kinds of color correction effects.	O
OK, I'm going to try to pronounce this name.	CHITCHAT
MTN look, thank you for following me.	CHITCHAT
You have to let me know if I pronounce your name correctly.	CHITCHAT
If you're in the chat at all, but again, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so 0.	O
Unblurred Daniel Martinez, thank you for following me.	CHITCHAT
Very nice, I think I'm going to boost the color in the white tones a little bit more so it has more of a gold feel.	O
'cause right now they come of- is more neutral.	O
Just to give it a little more warmth in that area.	O
Like I was talking about with one of the other people in the chat, they were asking about presets that you could set up an after effects in a similar manner to premiere.	O
And while I haven't had to do it myself, I suggested that they, if they know this, you know certain kinds of color corrections are going to do make a dummy comp with adjustment layer effects in it specifically for certain kinds of clips.	O
Oh Fabian Valenzuela right school, thank you for tuning in and thank you for following before.	CHITCHAT
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can boost.	O
That works.	O
It's a nice warm tone.	O
I'm going to take a look at this and if it looks good to go, I think.	O
Yeah, I think that we're basically good to go with this one.	O
I'm glad I went back and took a look at this.	O
'cause he effect was cool before, but it definitely needed emphasizing an.	O
I found some really cool ways to have it show up and only the only certain areas of the instrument.	O
Which was interesting and a lot of fun and involves playing with levels so it only shows up in those areas.	O
So it creates the sense that those trails that you see feel like they're being projection Maps.	O
Or at least are composited in a more detailed way.	O

Bring it back right?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Most resourceful, I'm not sure what's going to be there.	O
I'm going to have happy paper 'cause these toilet paper.	O
He's going to be with a bunch of toilet paper.	O
Um, best Baker model is going to have like her best cake or her best bread or whatever and Samu since he's Rye bread.	O
He's going to be all moldy.	O
I thought that was really cute lol.	O
I think will probably be.	O
I'm not sure I've got to think about her, um.	O
She's very resourceful, so maybe she's making a uhm.	O
Maybe she's working with cute there to sell fresh produce, or I'm not sure.	O
Or maybe she's the one hoarding all the toilet paper to sell it later.	O
Oh, maybe she did.	O
Maybe she hoarded all the toilet paper.	O
That would be that would be her style.	O
She would see the demand and then she would turn around and sell it.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So I'll have like.	CHITCHAT
I'll have like, I think, a darkened room who that's going to be a set up.	O
Maybe a darkened room with her silhouette in the door.	O
In all of this toilet paper, kind of just receding into the darkness.	O
I think that'll be a good one.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's get going.	O
So the first thing you need to do here is settle on my.	O
My title card, which is I'm going to have the be cute Florentine awards so and I'll have like some drawing and stuff over here.	O
Oh I wanted to show how this last one.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
This is how the.	O
An I forgot to put this as my background on the stream, but I'll switch that out so it's that way for next time.	O
Creators, Please remember to stretch, hydrate and take regular breaks.	CHITCHAT
I really like how this turned out.	O
I don't know.	O
Many comic I think maybe.	O
Maybe that can be my third, maybe that can because I want to get to posting three times a week for comics so it's deleon drawings.	O
But three times a week for Carter twice for comics right now.	O
Maybe something like this is something I could handle an get done on a fairly regular basis.	O
My hair is just killing me right now.	O
You should've braided it or something, alright?	O
But that's how this turned out and I was working on this on Tuesday.	O
So let's go back to the quarantine awards and.	O
Since I have not much sketched out here except for my basic layout, I'm going to go ahead and zoom in and do a little sketching for the ideas here.	O
So I'm not erase this.	O
She's gonna have maybe her chefs hat on.	O
And her apron.	O
And she's going to be with her Little Mix.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I think that'll be simple.	O
Maybe best Baker, I don't need to put.	O
Maybe I'll do surround like piles of of bread loaves like she's made piles and piles and piles of dough.	O
Alright, so there's that one.	O
A group that now for happy let's delete this.	O

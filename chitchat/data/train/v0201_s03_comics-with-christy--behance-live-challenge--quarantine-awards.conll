And he'll have rolls of toilet paper here, just kind of.	O
Alright, so that'll be his rough sketch alright and then 4.	O
Samu Andrew is going to the.	O
And a half the mold.	O
It's a mold growing on him 'cause he's Rye bread.	O
Not do his little his his little shorts.	O
Alexander, hello, how are you today?	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
I am doing some rough sketching here.	O
I am trying to figure out.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Certain things on the comet which.	O
There we go, so let's see I need El here.	O
And she's got the slide look on her face.	O
Door is open.	O
Lights framing her.	O
And she's done toilet paper.	O
How is it nice?	O
Alright, I'm moving that like that and then let's go down here and do the rough sketch for this.	O
Most resourceful will be cocoa and the Floofs.	O
Um, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Maybe she's delivering fresh bread.	O
Maybe she's got a wheelbarrow.	O
She's falling.	O
In a fluke has a list.	O
And maybe there's another flu folding something here.	O
And this is just a simple.	O
A simple little like they're walking along a sidewalk or path to get this food delivery made and she's got a bunch of bags.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
That's not too bad.	O
Alright, so let's move back out here.	O
And Alright, so this is going to be cute.	O
I like this.	CHITCHAT
I like this a lot.	CHITCHAT
Especially like Samu with his mode.	O
Yes, how are you?	CHITCHAT
Doing good here.	CHITCHAT
Hey Brad, how are you welcome everyone to the stream doing a special be handslide challenge today?	CHITCHAT
They came up with the idea of doing the weekly challenge on the stream, so you may see some other streamers doing this.	O
There's no real set.	O
Like rules, it's just a theme, so I'm taking the Quarantine Award theme and I'm applying it to this comic.	O
So like all my characters are getting, you know, an award for what they excelled at during Florentine, so momo did a lot of baking, happy papers, toilet paper, so he was elusive.	O
And I've got some characters being helpful.	O
Some characters growing a haircut that they may not necessarily like and want to continue beyond Quarantine.	O

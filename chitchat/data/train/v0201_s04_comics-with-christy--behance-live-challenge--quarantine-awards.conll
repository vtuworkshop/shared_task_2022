So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no, I think this will be a fun one.	CHITCHAT
It's a nice cute one.	CHITCHAT
I'm keeping the illustrations for each panel.	O
Kind of concise so I'll have just the no special text know Rev and I was thinking of doing that last night and actually designing real badges.	O
If I had done that for I keep on talking to my chat box which is right here instead of the camera.	O
Which is right here?	O
Instead of the.	O
Instead of the badges that I had done before, for like coconuts, I did a comic where coconut was getting awards for kitten camp and I thought that was really cute to design those, but I think it would be better to show the characters actually doing the actions.	O
I'm glad you're having a good day guys.	O
It is bright, the sun is shining and quit things are happening.	O
I've got to do a lot of printing tonight for an order that came in their big prints too.	O
I'm so excited.	CHITCHAT
I love making big Prince.	O
Uhm, but yeah so.	CHITCHAT
And that reminds me, I asked you add comic prints to the website.	O
I'm going to make a whole different section.	O
Alright, so this is kind of how I break things up.	O
If I were doing, um, Instagram only, I would try to, you know, kind of go between the Max on Instagram is at least from what I.	O
Personally like to read and I think is still readable is 4 frames for that.	O
That little square that you get an again that all depends on the designer and the text size, but I personally like to do this white because that allows you the entire frame.	O
More detail and.	O
I just think it looks better personally, but you know, swipe no swipe is an argument that has happened quite a bit.	O
So what I'm going to do here is I'm going to group.	O
These three and I'm going to start here.	O
So what I do if you've not watched make comics before.	O
If I do a very rough sketch and.	O
I do that before I proceed to line art, so I have an idea of the layout of the full page.	O
I have an idea of the content of each frame an I know about.	O
You know if I need too.	O
I'm thinking at this point of where these are going to be displayed in how, so in this case, since it's a comic that goes on mobile format on, you know like my website and read it and Facebook.	O
I have a vertical layout and then the when I break up for Instagram is designed for swiping over 10 frames, so I'm kind of thinking about that and keeping those panels within that range 'cause I don't like to split.	O
Comics between two different posts.	O
I don't like to go beyond 10.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking about that all the while and.	O
If I.	O
Have to go if I have, it's a really long forum comic, uhm?	O
How Onyx either the title card or or the info card at the end and give myself a full 10 but.	O
Usually I don't need to do that and this kind of a comic link keeps me.	O
Kiss me on Schedule 2 so 'cause I can I can complete this in a day and not be too.	O
2.	O
Too burdened.	O
Alright, so um next step I've dimmed my line art here and I am going to work on.	O
I might say the title card for last.	O
I'm just going to think about what I want to put up there.	O
I really enjoyed the title card that I did for this.	O
If you were here Tuesday I did the line art for most of this and last night I went in and I added.	O
What I did was I started out with his right side.	O
I designed the UM.	O
These little elements that were going to be right here and then I duplicated that over here and then I did some little kind of adjustments to make it not an exact match because like the clay right here, I kind of did it to fit over here and then I did a tablet and a laptop and I did a cutting mat down here for crafters pearlers and that type of artist and creator.	O

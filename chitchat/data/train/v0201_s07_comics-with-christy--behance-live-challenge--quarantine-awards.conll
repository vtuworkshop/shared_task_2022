I mean she's already smiling, but let's just do that so we have a big let's see about her arms here.	O
And I'm going to put a knit.	O
Over the end of her.	O
Because she's going to be carrying a red tray.	O
And I like to draw the.	O
Like to draw the complete pass so I can be sure this won't be in the final bit, but.	O
I just wanna make sure everything is there.	O
How much time without with super grid?	O
How we doing on the on the hydrate?	O
I really I don't know.	O
I like I had to take out.	O
I had another one up.	O
Let me show that when I mean I like the line like that but I just I mean.	O
With adding the rest of it, it was too busy, so I wanted to.	O
I needed to simplify things so I took out that an I think it works together a lot better, especially if I'm printing on a small scale.	O
Those extra lines in there would have really mucked things up and made it hard to read.	O
So I always want to keep legibility in mind when I'm doing those effects, and if I do a lot of type details like that.	O
Like for example on this one you can't really see it, but I I did lining in the drop shadow on the One Cup and in the final print this is 3 inches.	O
It didn't really show up, it showed up a tiny bit, but I mean.	O
I think it would have to be probably bigger to really really stand out, so it's nothing I can keep in mind for the future.	O
Those tiny details necessarily show up.	O
But hold on just a second here.	CHITCHAT
I'll be right back.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Back	CHITCHAT
So let's go back over here.	O
Bring this stuff a little bit coming out.	O
Come over here in a racer tail.	O
Yeah, let's think about the UM.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
I think about the tray.	O
With her friend up on it.	O
Maybe she's using an Air Bay tree?	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And so that's going to mean this NIT is going to be dropped out.	O
This is not going to necessarily.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Understand.	CHITCHAT
That's interesting.	O
Yeah, see her bread is gonna be I'm gonna go ahead and probably.	O
Grateful bread Just so I can run.	O
Jump in here and.	O
See it better.	O
Put the.	O
No.	O
Whoops, didn't mean to do that with my been doing that a lot.	CHITCHAT

She wants out some Nicoletta out like this.	O
Yes, they were.	O
They are.	O
Well, I just II she wants out so let me out here.	O
Alright, so um, yes, the original inspiration inspiring Katz mobile cheats.	O
Evil landlord and fat cat.	O
They've all since passed away along with cheap, most recently in September, and that was to this character is based of- of she was just the sweetest.	O
We quiet, gentle cat and.	O
The current ones I have are coconut and Tuxi and that is coconut is the inspiration for this character right here, which this is coconut right here in her colored form.	O
And that's normal cheat so much.	O
It was a she's kind of a Brown mixed tabby.	O
And so when I was designing her character, I wanted to keep the forehead stripes, 'cause hers were very, very, very stark and really beautiful.	O
She also had these kind of cold out lines around her eyes, so I wanted to keep that and kind of went when I blurred my vision to look at her code.	O
It kind of averaged out to this caramel Brown color.	O
And then she had her for White Sox, so that's how I designed that character from life coconut.	O
She is dumb.	O
Not originally she's a calico, but apparently calicos only have the black.	O
The Orange in the white.	O
They don't have any other colors mixed in and she does specially like she's just done, but she's got everything, but if you average it out, she's got orange over her head and so I just kind of translated that into an orange cap and she also has these patches on her shoulders and that's where her little shoulder patches come from and.	O
The striped tail and the Patch on her on her toe shoes are also are pretty close to what she has on her actual body.	O
Tough see is a tuxedo cat, but he's great.	O
He's not a black tuxedo.	O
He's a great acido and he's got the four white paws and he's got a little triangle of white like like white showing through shirt coat jacket.	CHITCHAT
And he's a sweet boy.	CHITCHAT
And so those are the current cats I have.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, evil landlord was based off of a cat.	O
Who was?	CHITCHAT
She had a lot of personality.	CHITCHAT
She was very saucy.	O
She would lay claim to anything that would come in the door.	O
Let's be bringing the Mail and the Lopes boxes.	O
She would have to sit on it and.	O
We joke that the that she charged the other cats rent so because she was kind of the Queen Bee and fat cat was choosing a very shy Sweet girl.	O
She was a rescue that I had gotten.	CHITCHAT
Quite a while ago she.	CHITCHAT
When I rescued her from the rescue house, she was kind of getting picked on by other cats, so she was always very timid.	CHITCHAT
And but kind of oddly, loud, 'cause like wherever she would go should always be talking and chattering at me so.	CHITCHAT
She was a sweet girl as well.	CHITCHAT
Pudge the pug is based off a pug I had growing up.	O
Um and also, um, another dog, another pug that my parents had.	O
That's more of a base for Frankie though.	O
Which is another pub character that I have.	O
OK, there we go.	CHITCHAT
I'm moving this over so yeah, so that's a little bit behind that.	O
Those guys.	O
They're all good little guys.	O
So I'm going to have kind of a pile of bread behind are so she's going to.	O

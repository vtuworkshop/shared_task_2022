I am using a centriq 24 pro.	O
This is the protest.	O
And I just got this.	O
It comes with this express key remote.	O
I just got this a couple days ago and so I'm still getting used to it.	O
Previous to that I was using the 13 HD and I've used that one for since like very early in January 2016.	O
So it held up really well.	O
I think it would be compareable on your current lineup to the welcome one or I believe there's also a 13 pro.	O
But I don't know the difference on the.	O
I have to go back and look at the at the.	O
Compare like the you know, I think the new pro lines are on the new pro pen and has a higher pressure sensitivity.	O
I think that's the big difference because that's something I really noticed.	O
When I switched over I my line art has I mean.	O
I've been able to get a lot more variation and I noticed that immediately so.	O
That was a big big.	O
Big happy bonus for me.	O
Alright, so now I'm working on save save if you haven't lately I'm going to work on happy paper.	O
He's my toilet paper character.	O
And if you look you right here, that's his plushy version.	O
An right on top of him as a medium plushy version, it's actually the original medium.	O
I've gotten several different sizes.	O
I have gotten a 12 inch brush, a 10 inch.	O
Is that really 10 inch now 'cause the new ones 10 inches?	O
Uhm, he's I think maybe 8.	O
And then I got a little Evie.	O
Little itty bitty in.	O
We can't see him really well, but he's kinda over here.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I got those prototypes for him and.	O
We turned out so well.	O
He said.	CHITCHAT
Music.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Really.	CHITCHAT
What you're hearing is coconut getting very busy.	CHITCHAT
Sharpening her claws on my little carpet in here.	CHITCHAT
Very nice.	CHITCHAT
Here she is.	O
Just this cocoa beans.	O
And she's trying to make a move for herself.	O
I will make her freeze.	O
There you go.	O

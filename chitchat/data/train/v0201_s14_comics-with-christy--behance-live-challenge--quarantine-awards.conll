That applies though for that too.	O
'cause you've got a notice story.	O
The background of a character to design them well.	O
You know their motivations, you know even the clothes that they wear.	O
I mean, there's a motivation why they picked something over something else as a weapon, or as you know.	O
As an everyday item that they wear and that's all you know, informing the audience when they see your character.	O
What the wrist support for?	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's just my wrist.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is actually I have a couple of them.	CHITCHAT
I've gone through several listens pretty ratty but it.	CHITCHAT
So I would say it's a light support.	CHITCHAT
This is a compression.	CHITCHAT
Brace right here, it's pretty tight and then this is a different material.	CHITCHAT
We've it's more, it's more breathable, and what I do is I have it kind of.	CHITCHAT
I have the compression piece going right over the bend in my wrist, and that's where I kind of need to support the most.	CHITCHAT
This also helps with this right here my hands slide across the tablet surface because these things you know not as much as they used to, but they do heat up and your hands get sweaty and so it can stick on the screen.	CHITCHAT
Well, if you have a guard there, some guards hook over the pinkie or hook over these two fingers.	CHITCHAT
But for me this brace kind of does it well enough for both functions.	CHITCHAT
I just I need a little bit of that stabilization.	CHITCHAT
I do a lot of.	CHITCHAT
I also have this wrist brace for when I'm using my mouse.	CHITCHAT
I have a bad habit of pressing right down here on the desk when my hand is on the desk, so that creates numbness going up my arm so it's just I have to kinda and I do it unintentionally without thinking so I have to put those things in place so I don't really mess up my risk.	CHITCHAT
I have, um, I have more heavy duty ones 'cause I have really, really messed it up or I've not been able to draw that well, uhm.	CHITCHAT
I've got one that has kind of like a pillow and this one totally immobilize is the wrist.	CHITCHAT
It's designed for use at night.	CHITCHAT
It's got a pillow here that keeps your wrist in a neutral position, an it has.	CHITCHAT
It has also kind of.	CHITCHAT
Extra cushions here to keep your fingers.	CHITCHAT
It's all the help.	CHITCHAT
Keep your wrist and give it a rest.	CHITCHAT
Does the graphic tablet really help in drawing so they could alternative to mouse and keyboard?	CHITCHAT
I would have to say yes, well I mean.	CHITCHAT
It really depends on how you work.	CHITCHAT
I mean, for me, yes, I mean, I was doing keyboard and mouse art for years before I got my first tablet and he difference was phenomenal.	CHITCHAT
I was able to do a lot more detail.	CHITCHAT
I was able to and it also really reinvigorated my interest in digital art because there was such a bar with using the keyboard and mouse with the things I wanted to do and how I wanted to do them.	CHITCHAT
And I want to qualify that because I mean some people they never, they don't need a tablet.	CHITCHAT
There's a lettering artist that I follow Jessica she, she really prefers keyboard and mouse for her digital work.	CHITCHAT
And she's doing a lot of vector work with letters and designs like that.	CHITCHAT
So it really depends on what you're doing and what you want to accomplish.	CHITCHAT
If the tablet is a good fit for you.	CHITCHAT
But for me personally, I.	CHITCHAT
Really enjoy traditional art and drawing in that way and I was not able to bridge the gap.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't able to draw down here and look up here.	CHITCHAT
It was very, very difficult for me, but as soon as I combine those two and was able to draw down here and look here, that just kind of changed the broader, closer traditional illustration for me.	CHITCHAT

An really helped me advance my skills.	CHITCHAT
But again, I think that answer is based on what you're trying to accomplish.	CHITCHAT
If the tablet is a good fit for you or not.	CHITCHAT
If you're doing a lot of graphic design work annuar in illustrator for lettering and all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
When I do graphic design work, I'm amazingly like keyboard and mouse again, so it switches over so my workspaces designed to allow me to do both.	CHITCHAT
I can push this out-of-the-way use keyboard and mouse do writing if I need to an.	CHITCHAT
And not be, you know, have everything crowding in at once.	CHITCHAT
But I can say personally that the tablet really changed a lot of things for me.	CHITCHAT
It helps me speed up.	CHITCHAT
It helped me because originally I would take several days to do one web comic and I would be, you know, keyboard mouse drawing out every single thing.	CHITCHAT
Things that take me a lot less time now to do.	CHITCHAT
So like for example, I would use the pen tool and the width tool to give line variance something that I do now is just a stroke and the blob brush tool and I can create these more sketchy doughy lines when I could with the with the pen tool.	CHITCHAT
So for me it was a game changer, but for you it may not be or it maybe you just have to sit down and be honest with yourself.	CHITCHAT
Say what am I trying to accomplish?	CHITCHAT
And what is the work that I really love doing?	CHITCHAT
And it's just a tool that will help me.	CHITCHAT
'cause in the end it's all a tool.	CHITCHAT
I mean this is nothing that you know.	CHITCHAT
Your basics are what's going to make your art.	CHITCHAT
Advance, you know if you're studying.	CHITCHAT
If you're studying lettering.	CHITCHAT
If you're studying anatomy.	CHITCHAT
If you're studying, you know the fundamentals, composition, values, and all of that.	CHITCHAT
That is what you're going to advance quickly with more so than changing up any tools, and that's why you gotta keep in mind too.	CHITCHAT
It's not an answer to make your art better, it's an answer to accelerate.	CHITCHAT
I think more.	CHITCHAT
The things that you're doing, I hope that answers that well, but personally for me it was a game changer an I can't discount that at all and I would, you know, my gut reaction is to say yes.	CHITCHAT
Um, it really does make a difference, but you know, if you're being honest, you can kind of say, Well, you know what type of work are you doing and.	CHITCHAT
Is this going to be a good solution for that or not?	CHITCHAT
Because I know a lot of these special, if you're looking at Welkom, it's quite an investment and it's not something to take lightly, and but there are also a lot of other affordable options out there from different.	CHITCHAT
Different manufacturers, which are all very viable.	CHITCHAT
I found several people with the ex depends which are a third of the cost of welcome, welcome, whatever.	CHITCHAT
Uhm.	CHITCHAT
And there's also Huey on there's.	CHITCHAT
Let's see welcome is coming out with their own line of more affordable.	CHITCHAT
Her tablets.	CHITCHAT
I think the.	CHITCHAT
The one was their answer there.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And let me see what are some other brands.	CHITCHAT
I know there are several others.	CHITCHAT
There's huion XP pen and I thought there was a third one.	CHITCHAT
There's also, you know this this option a lot of comic artists I follow.	CHITCHAT
They use the iPad pro they draw in.	CHITCHAT
You know any of the apps on there and they complete their comics in there.	CHITCHAT
There's just so many options.	CHITCHAT
And it's really another question you know well, do I do this in my, you know mobile worker?	CHITCHAT
do I really enjoy taking my work around to different places?	CHITCHAT
do I like working in cafes or out in the park and still being able to do digital art?	CHITCHAT
You know, that's another thing you can consider.	CHITCHAT
You know the tablet could be very workable solution for you.	CHITCHAT
I, another artist I follow.	CHITCHAT
She does a lettering work like this.	CHITCHAT
On her iPad, but I think.	CHITCHAT

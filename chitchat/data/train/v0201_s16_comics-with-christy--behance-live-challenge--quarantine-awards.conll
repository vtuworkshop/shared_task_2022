What struck it off the list for me was there was no eraser and I don't know if that's changed since then, but I do a lot of flipping and erasing and that it's so integral in my workflow that I was like I think that's not something I can say Oh well, I'll get used to it, 'cause that means I'll be doing, you know, flipping into another hot key in my hotkeys are pretty set up here.

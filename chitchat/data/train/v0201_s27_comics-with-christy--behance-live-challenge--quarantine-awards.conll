Um?	CHITCHAT
You're not bound to settings like in Photoshop, which is of raster program.	O
You're kind of set, you know, a lot of artists.	O
They will start, they'll start off with a low res file, will get a lot of work done, and then they'll bump it up to 300 DPI if they want to go for print, you kind of have to do a little bit more file or thinking and press around your your work when your work.	O
When you're working in Photoshop, you've got to think about OK.	O
am I only going to use this for web?	O
am I going to use this for?	O
Print do I want to make it high res enough in case they want to do for print an then you gotta set up your file to potentially be.	O
Workable in those final situations like those print situations, but I remember a lot of single lot.	O
You know, starting out with the 72 DPI which is screen rise and then bumping it up once you get closer to the final product of 300 and filling things in.	O
It really as far as you know, prep in working on my end.	O
I really like the fact that I just draw it once and I don't have to really worry.	O
Aside from, you know.	O
Like Orientation and stuff like that I don't have to worry about, you know, is this going to look good on 11 by 17 is just going to look good printed 24 by 36.	O
I know the answer is yes because this can be scaled up and down indefinitely.	O
You may not have that versatility unless you think about it as you're going into it with a raster designed illustration.	O
But again, you know a lot of people that are doing it professionally.	O
They just they have those things set up and ready to go and.	O
They're designing with that end in mind anyway, so it really is what you're used to.	O
If there is a learning curve for illustrator, there's a learning curve.	O
Really for any program, but I think Photoshop, probably for drawing purposes, especially with all the brushes and things you have available as closer, maybe to traditional art.	O
But I started out in um, using vectors, doing a lot of keyboard and mouse drawing, and so this is the program that I know best and I'm fastest in, so that's what I've always stuck with.	O
And plus I love that I can take any of these guys.	O
And, you know, do whatever I want with them and the file back when file size mattered a lot, I would create.	O
Add files and they would be a fraction of the size of a.	O
You know a TIF file that I would have to send out an the TIF file could take 40 to 50 minutes to transfer, whereas you know two to four MB illustrator file just goes lickety split so that was another thing that kind of pushed me towards working illustrator a lot more than photo shop was.	O
The file size and.	O
'cause you can create any.	O
Massive monsters of files, or you can do that in either program, but you know it kind of.	O
Kinda was more par for the course with photo shop stuff.	O
Schrader come on.	O
There we go.	O
Exercise that's good.	O
Alright, actually, no, let's go up a little bit more.	O
So coconut her quarantine award is most helpful.	O
And she is making food deliveries with her friends.	O
How do you like it?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
You coming here on this group?	CHITCHAT
She's leaning forward.	O

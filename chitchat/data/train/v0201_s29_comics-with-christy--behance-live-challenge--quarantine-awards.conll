But as far as my style developing, uhm, I didn't necessarily have to use illustrator, but I elected to because of the benefits that I needed at the time, which was speed and small file size.	O
So what I was doing.	O
And so that was really estimation of your influences.	O
You know you can see a lot of.	O
At least I can see a lot of Calvin and Hobbes Bill Waterson, especially in my backgrounds and in my sketching style in King style, I can see that a lot.	O
I can also see.	O
You know some influence of.	O
Anime influence I can see.	O
You know lots of Disney influence, but an also just traditional science fiction because I've.	O
And the big reader.	O
And that was one of the first pieces really types of art that I fell in love with.	O
One of my first art books was from an artist and his name is Michael Whelan.	O
He does a lot of cover art for science fiction and fantasy books, and I saved up my allowance to get his art book.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
The world.	O
The artist, Michael Whelan.	O
When I was in grade school an I poured over that thing and that really so I have a big influence on science fiction and fantasy art as well, but it doesn't really inform my active style.	O
It informs some of my choices of subject matter.	O
Most definitely go.	O
Do I want to switch directionality?	O
Kind of like that.	O
Alright, so I need to.	O
Actually draw.	O
So the the handle for the.	O
Things might be coming out like this.	O
And I might have to move it back a little bit.	O
Her move her forward.	O
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to group.	O
Miss Cocco being removed for forward a little bit, 'cause that'll make more sense with the angle of this.	O
And how I need to draw it 'cause it attaches usually here and only the gravel reference just to be sure.	O
I've got.	O
The wheelbarrow.	O
Handle here.	O
Let's just go.	O
I was right, it was the OR.	O
It was the triangular and then I was just look at the classic radio flyer.	O
So this has about like a joint here and then it has the pole.	O
This one has the wooden Slats on it, still the same.	O
It goes to the axle trailer hold.	O
That is a little bit better.	O
That looks like a chunkier version of the classic.	O
OK, that's all I needed.	O
Alright, so for drawing.	O
This guy he's got.	O
I'm just going to keep that simple.	O
Hold up a second.	CHITCHAT
I gotta be RV got a delivery.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I am back.	CHITCHAT

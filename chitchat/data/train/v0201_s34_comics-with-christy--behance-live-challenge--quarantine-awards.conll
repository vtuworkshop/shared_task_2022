You can kind of check out some of the.	CHITCHAT
Some of the other lives for I know, two simplest does a lot of streaming on fresco, and so does sticky.	CHITCHAT
They both stream regularly on here, so if you want to know about tablet softwares.	CHITCHAT
That those are, uhm.	CHITCHAT
The Streamers I would definitely suggest there.	CHITCHAT
He just flew his reading of the.	CHITCHAT
With their delivery list.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So this is how I drops.	O
I draw my floof some.	O
Since there are there another example of the flour sack being sack rice stack idea?	O
I just draw kind of almost a gumdrop shape.	O
For them to start and then I go through and I give them your fur.	O
And I give them their legs.	O
And what I've done with their body shape all erase it and I'll just have prefer kind of texture left.	O
So you can kind of see that right in action there an one thing I forgot to do that I need to do is group.	O
So I'm gonna do here now.	O
Was in the middle of the select a pre selected until you select some of the things that I didn't want to originally have in this section so I can draw my food without a problem.	O
At here and we got since he's walking.	O
I'm gonna bring his little butt fluff over here.	O
Things right here.	O
So he's gonna be saying our next deliveries over here.	O
Pointing where we've got a little bit busy.	O
It seems to be able to grab the star model.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
Air.	O
Cancel so this is a little bit.	O
Michelle.	O
The detail there.	O
Speaking this way please.	O
Mr.	O
Foods is done, So what this helps me to do when I group it is I can just kind of draw box around this area, select everything and then deselect this little guys group so I can erase behind him once I want to clean up everything.	O
Once I have who.	O
Also in his final position.	O
So I'm going to move him probably up a little bit like that but now I can go ahead and select everything in this general area, deselect him and then just erase this stuff.	O
That's going to interfere with his line art.	O
Alright, so now I need to draw the trailing floofs over here and the rest of my road which is going to be like this.	O
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Grassy that's here we go a little bit above a road bump here.	O

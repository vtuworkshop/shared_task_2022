Get to know what each one of them does, how to create the effects that you want and.	O
Is really 'cause the biggest.	O
I think the learning curve in illustrator.	O
It comes with familiarity of the tools and getting your hotkeys in line.	O
Because once you know, a lot of those quick keys and have them memorized and kind of 2nd nature that will speed you up a lot.	O
It will make working in illustrator a lot easier.	O
Like for example you'll see me do a lot of things and you'll hear clicking keyboard in the background.	O
You know, that's me with my left hand, almost always on shift control and.	O
All for the different quick keys and hotkeys.	O
Pressing one of those on certain tools affords me so like if I have my direct selection, I can select this, hit out and do a copy and paste without you know, selecting it control C Control V.	O
You can do that very quickly and that will speed up those little speed additions.	O
You know, little things that will be a little bit more time.	O
Well will really help.	O
It just getting around illustrator doing things in it, specially if you're looking if you've got a tablet and you want to explore drawing in it and sketching it like I do.	O
You want to see if you your style maybe more towards using the paintbrush tool and applying a lot of different brushes to it to get different effects and do maybe like for example of retro stylized illustration.	O
You can do that with pretty easily with different brushes and stuff that you won't necessarily get if you're doing what I do.	O
Um, when using a blob brush tool?	O
Kind of 'cause I mean yes, technically this does have a stroke.	O
It's a Phil though, so it'll be the blush brush we applied around the outside of the shape, but.	O
If you're using the brush, for example when you're using things like, you know brush packs from retro supply company or anywhere you can apply really neat effects and do things like that.	O
All depends on the style that you're going for and what you want to accomplish, but as far as just drawing in illustrator, if it's you know, kind of a realism, look you're looking for.	O
Or, you know, I would definitely try to replicate, you know, still life or objects or you know like for example glass that you have in front of you just have it right there, try to draw it and really get into those tools and figure out what you like to use and what you don't.	O
If you're looking for more flat design I would look at examples of Design and art that you really like that are more flat and nature.	O
Whether it's icons or some of the flat art, you know that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
What was that one fire game really?	O
Beautiful art that was designed by Olly Moss.	O
Um, some of that type of stuff use that as inspiration and try to create your own version of it and just really get into those tools and figure out what you like to do and you're going to get.	O
You know, kind of snag some places.	O
I mean, that's part of the learning process is the process of learning through failures, and you know, figuring OK, this doesn't work, but this does, so I'm going to go with this and I like how this looks better than that.	O
So I think in any program, whether it's illustrator or Photoshop, you're going to have a little bit of that adjustment period to figure out what you're doing and how to do it and how you accomplish what you want.	O
But yeah, I would, just, you know.	O
Specially if you're learning illustrator, just start working with it.	O
Start saying OK if I'm going to do lettering designs, start doing better in design.	O
Figure out something you want to emulate and figure out how to emulate it.	O
That's I did a lot of.	O
Seen studies.	O
To that end, because I wanted to figure out how to do a lot of different things, I would study.	O
Stills from Miyazaki movies and I did a couple of tutorial streams where I was recreating like the breakfast scene from House moving Castle with the with Calcifer and the the pan in the frying eggs.	O
I recreated that actually on stream and it was a process to figure out how to get in illustrator.	O
This done 'cause I had to layer different objects, I drew the exit through the ham.	O
I drew the pan but I also split the pan in half so I could layer.	O
The front portion of it to hide part of the stuff that was in it, and so it's just.	O
It's a.	CHITCHAT
It's a good learning process if you do it like that, you'll figure out a lot of different things.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like it, said Arthur.	CHITCHAT
At this will be a lot of fun when 6:00 AM.	CHITCHAT

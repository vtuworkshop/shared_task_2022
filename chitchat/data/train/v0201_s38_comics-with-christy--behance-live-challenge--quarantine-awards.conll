Once it's done, colored, done and colored.	O
I especially in looking forward to making sample rimoldi, making him moldy bread with little fluffy Tufts of fungus.	O
I think that's kind of maybe how some of us felt and not being able to or I mean you know, just having it grow out so long.	O
Most resourceful, evil landlord.	O
She's always resourceful and I think this is going to be a fun one.	O
I really like it.	CHITCHAT
But the whole credit goes to Mr Ryan Selby, who came up with the idea for the weekly challenge.	O
Excited to see what next weeks will be.	O
I don't know if I'll work it into a comic again or if it will be a challenge Tuesday deal, but this was the V can't slide challenge for today is the correntina words so.	O
I think that'll be, oh, what is the best mobile software for sketching?	O
Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Well, if you OK.	CHITCHAT
I would have to.	CHITCHAT
I don't have a lot of experience in that.	O
I do know that there are a lot of different options.	O
There's of course Adobe fresco fresco.	O
Adobe fresco.	O
They're also mobile versions of illustrator and Photoshop.	O
You can try out I've seen live streams on those that are really cool.	O
You can even take pictures and create.	O
You know things that you draw in traditional media and paper, and you can take pictures of that.	O
Now with those mobile apps and make brushes for usage in Photoshop and illustrator and such.	O
There's also other brands like procreate and clip studio paint has a mobile app as well, so it really.	O
Depends on what you're trying to accomplish.	O
If you want to just sketch then I would just, you know, download and try out a bunch of different options and see which is the best for you, which is kind of closest to your style that you want to an efficient in making what you want.	O
And fun as well.	O
You know, if you find a program that's really fun and engaging, those encourage you to work with it more and draw more, which is ultimately how you're going to improve more so.	O
Thank you so much Chris.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely thank you so much for attending at and I hope you have a great day.	CHITCHAT
I will be live again on the pants on Tuesday, Tuesdays or challenge days where I'm doing something that's pushing me out of my comfort zone.	O
It can be anywhere from a unconventional camera angle on a daily painting too.	O
Challenging myself to draw a bunch of different emotions or remotes for using stickers.	O
Yes, actually Jane, I do animate using illustrator and Photoshop for now.	O
I have tried.	CHITCHAT
I have tried to use all.	O
After effects a little bit and I actually use it used after effects from my starting screen and I can here let me show you that real quick.	O
This is my starting screen that I did in after effects and this was actually a learning experience for me.	O
I downloaded a free file that was posted for people to use and learn from and I took little animated jiffs that I made as well as a bunch of different sketches and I layered that in.	O
And I figured out how to get the characters to show up inside the letters.	O
So that was a big learning experience for me, but that's as far as I've got an illustrating with after.	O
Sorry animating with after effects.	O
But as far as making actual.	O
2D animation I have been using thus far illustrator to make my frames and then exported those frames over to photo shop to use the timeline feature there because that's what I'm familiar with.	O
I've done a couple of little things in there I haven't taught myself animate yet, so gifts.	O
I just hope it's just a cold.	O
Peanut butter OK.	O
Uhm well let me catch up on chat.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for this pleasant stream.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thank you so much for joining.	CHITCHAT
OK I'm going to put my ending screen.	O
Oh if you wanna see this comic in its final finished form, it will be posted tomorrow across my socials which you can see on the left hand side of your screen.	O
You can also see them in my info below the video.	O
I post comics multiple times a week on Facebook, Instagram.	CHITCHAT

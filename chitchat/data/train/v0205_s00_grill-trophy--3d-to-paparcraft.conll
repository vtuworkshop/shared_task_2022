Hey hey Hey Alicia Cologne, here a tactile illustrator and your host to this live stream obviously but I'm super glad to be here today because we're going to be doing is something a little bit different than what you guys have been seeing us do right?	O
So lately we've been recreating Hirth Stone cards which is a digital playing game.	O
If you guys have watched this you I have said this several times so you guys know what her stone is by now.	O
If you know any other ones.	O
But we're going to take a break today because there's this really cool thing that's happening within the Behance community and their weekly challenges and so the thing that I thought would be really super fun was what if I was able to participate, which I am because I get to dictate what I end up showing so we're going to pause the her stone stuff.	O
OK, we're going to pause it and we're going to go ahead and move into what we're going to make today.	CHITCHAT
So you're probably wondering, OK, Licia, So what is this weekly challenge then?	CHITCHAT
Well, the weekly challenge is the quarin Teen Awards.	CHITCHAT
So you guys can see over here in the corner.	CHITCHAT
Note that way over there, the Corentine Awards is this weekly challenge.	CHITCHAT
And while we were while we were quarantining, and I said, we still are a little bit, but for the most part not really anymore, but where your mask when you go out?	CHITCHAT
OK, OK.	CHITCHAT
So our big thing was we.	CHITCHAT
Rediscovered our love for hamburgers and it was probably one of those things where a goddess outside out, you know, while we were cooking and I'll talk with that.	CHITCHAT
Things were really limited from a meat perspective, so like you could literally by two things, a beef every single time you went to the grocery store and it wasn't like I was going to go to the grocery store like a lot anyway, so we were going like once every two weeks and we would buy this like 5 pound log of beef, OK?	CHITCHAT
Um so funny.	CHITCHAT
Anyway that Â£5 log you could end up making two things like two big bags 'cause I have a family 5, two big batches of hamburgers.	CHITCHAT
So we made hamburgers.	CHITCHAT
All the time, like quite literally all the time.	CHITCHAT
So I was thinking OK.	CHITCHAT
I want to make a reward for like just.	CHITCHAT
How many hamburgers we've made or something?	CHITCHAT
Or just the fact that we like made hamburgers a lot?	CHITCHAT
Or that, like perhaps we grilled out more than we've ever grilled ever.	CHITCHAT
So OK, so I was thinking Yes will make a trophy.	O
So like what if you guys can kind of see my reference images over here?	O
What if we made a trophy like the base but the Cup part was the like a grill with like maybe a hamburger on top of it?	O
How amazing would that be now?	O
That's pretty ambitious to make in a 2 hour fan for sure.	O
So what I was thinking was like Alright, Hey?	O
I'm definitely going to need to focus and be, uh.	O
We definitely need to do this as simplified as possible, but I think it's totally worth it.	O
OK, but before I go on too much farther, I want to guys I want to invite you into something that's really fun.	O
Um, so?	CHITCHAT

So if you guys are interested into that, of course we're going to introduce and get to know each other, but then also one of my favorite parts is where I share inspiration every single day specifically from hand maker from crafts from makers.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, I would love for you guys to join that and I'm going to go ahead and put that hey mom, I'm going to go ahead and put that link.	CHITCHAT
Into the.	CHITCHAT
The chat now.	CHITCHAT
If you guys want that link.	CHITCHAT
And you see this little later.	CHITCHAT
And of course you guys don't get the chat.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause you guys see this video afterwards.	CHITCHAT
Just go ahead an DM me all my DMS are open over on Twitter and my username is over.	CHITCHAT
No over there in the corner at Alisha Club Alright, so let's go ahead.	CHITCHAT
Let's get started.	CHITCHAT
Let's make a Grill Trophy.	O
OK, alright so I'm going to go ahead and select everything in this scene.	O
Push X and we're going to delete.	O
Very cool all right now we're going to shift A to add.	O
A circle I'm going to go ahead and hit tab mode.	O
And we need to fill that circle.	O
Let's go ahead and fill it.	O
I'm going to click one just so we can kind of see what's going on.	O
I'm going to extrude along the Z access.	O
Alright, so how big do we want this?	O
I think that's good alright, I'm going to go over.	O
Alright cool, let's see no.	O
No, we still want solid.	O
So let's go one again alright so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to extrude but scale inward just a little bit then extrude upwards again just to her.	O
And then we're going to do that again, extrude, scale.	O
Extrude up All right, now we have our base.	O
The cool thing about all of that is that I'll be able to translate this to paper really good.	O
So I'm gonna click inner because that's where we're going to stay so I can confirm that.	O
And that's what it's looking like from the top, and that's what it's going to look like from the side.	O
Alright, so that's that's really nice, so I'm going to go ahead into face select mode by hitting my 3.	O
I'm just going to go ahead and maybe scale that a little bit more so it's kind of, you know, beveled.	O
I think that's cool.	CHITCHAT
And so now what I'm wondering is?	O
I kinda want like right now this has like this like nice little concave to it.	O
In paper I could do that, but it would be a bit of a headache so I'm not actually going to do that.	O
what I want to do, which I think would be neat, is that I'm going to go ahead and outside.	O
So this is our base going to hit 7 so you guys at the top.	O
That's the side so that their base.	O
All right, we're going to do is going to shift A and we're going to add another circle.	O
I'm going to go over top and I'm going to just move this along the Y axis that you guys can see what it looks like, OK?	O
Actually, before I do That, crap.	O
Alright, I'm gonna have to redo that.	O
Alright so mesh circle I need to go over here and I'm going to add my vertices.	O
Right now I'm at 32 vertices.	O
I don't want 32 vertices.	O
Let's do like.	O
6 Alright cool, and now we're going to move it.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
That looks good.	CHITCHAT
OK, we're going to go ahead and scale it.	O
And because I did scale it here, I'm going to actually need to apply.	O
And we need to apply that scale.	O
Alright, sweet, so we're going to go ahead hit tab.	O
That means that we're going to move into our edit mode.	O
We're going to hit one.	O
Actually, let's move it to the side.	O
So we need to go ahead and move that back into the world origin, because that's just generally speaking, how it works.	O
To the center.	O
All right and then we have a wire frame 'cause so now you know it's in there, but you don't necessarily know where it's at right?	O
Because we moved it.	O
So there we go.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to go to the side view and I 'cause I want to move this all the way to the top.	O
All right?	O
And now we're going to extrude tuckered so extrude this way.	O
June 2 term.	O
Alright cool.	CHITCHAT
So now we have an I'm going to go ahead and get the X-ray.	O
And we can get out of wire frame 2.	O
So there we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is, this is what we have all right?	O

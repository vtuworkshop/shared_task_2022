So one of the things that I want to do though however.	O
As I'm thinking this needs to be a wee bit bigger in order for it to feel a little bit more.	O
Like I guess, kingly is that normally have like these really awesome like sins to Biggs, Alright so.	O
I'm thinking maybe the base needs to be we smaller, so I'm going to go ahead and click that now.	O
And make it a little bit smaller.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I do like this extreme.	O
I like this extreme, like from big to tall.	O
Alright, so there you go, that's that's what we're looking at.	O
Alright, sweet, so now I have these two pieces, but I'm going to want these pieces to be 1.	O
So what I can do is I can select this one this circle.	O
When I go to this modifier and I'm going to go to Boolean, Boolean Boolean Bowling, I don't know, alright, but we're going to union fi this with this.	O
Boom Shaka Laka Alright so now that is one piece.	O
So now whenever I go to edit mode.	O
It's one piece I don't know why.	O
It looks like it's too.	O
Yes, I'm going to move you.	O
I'm gonna select U and we're going to move you.	O
But I just like make sure that you were added.	O
So I'm really, oh was it not?	O
If it wasn't touching, then that was probably maybe the issue.	O
But you can definitely see that there's two there, so I'm like super confused as to what's happening right now.	O
But anyway, we are going to continue.	O
We're going to move on because that's Life Alright.	O
So now friends, we need to create the grill part because what I want is that I want this trophy to lead in the reason why I'm doing this, uhm?	O
What's 6?	O
I don't know what is 6 sided thing is I don't know, but anyway, the reason why we're doing a 6 sided thing is because I really want it to stand out against the circle.	O
All right, but we only need a half a circle.	O
So I'm going to go ahead.	O
I'm going to take all of that cool stuff and we're just going to go ahead and slide it to the X.	O
Because while you're cool, we're not, we're not moving, we're not doing all that stuff right now.	O
Alright cool, so I'm going to go ahead and we're going to make a UV sphere.	O
Boom, Shaka Laka Alright, that's going to be R Grill.	O
Alright, so now.	CHITCHAT
I want to stretch it.	O
Actually someone could do this here, right?	O
So I'm going to want to stretch it on the X axis just just a hair to make it a little bit more bulbous.	O
All right, and then I'm going to want to stretch it on the Y axis a little bit.	O
Alright, sweet and so now that I've done that.	O
The whole thing needs to get bigger.	O
So let's just go ahead and stretch the whole thing, and now you definitely notice that there is a.	O
This is 1/2, right?	O
We need like 1/2.	O
So what I'm going to do?	CHITCHAT
Is we are going to probably starting from like maybe here?	O
Yeah, I think that's good.	CHITCHAT
We're going to essentially select these loop cuts.	O
And the way that you select a loop cut is by shift alt.	O
Oh wrong lip wrong one.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Sweet, and now we need to select him this way too.	O
Oh fudge, that was the wrong one.	O
Ha I need I need to go the other way dude.	O
And I am I holding wrong Haha I am.	O
Now we're selecting all of this stuff.	O
Oh come on Boo.	CHITCHAT
No, don't do it individually man.	O
If I have to go select all those stuff differently, that's fine.	O
Alright cool, so I'm going to hit X.	O
Nope, that's not X.	O
X vertices delete boom.	O
Alright so, but there are some vertices that are over here.	O
That are like floating somewhere.	O
Oh no, I ended up deleting them all.	O
Boom.	CHITCHAT
Oh hey Jasmine, good to see ya.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT

Six sides does a hexagon.	O
I thought I know that's right of Pentagon is five sides.	O
Hello alright, that took a little bit my bad.	CHITCHAT
My Bad Alright cool so now what I want to do?	CHITCHAT
Is we are going to put this?	O
Which it looks really, really big, but what we're going to do now?	O
Actually, I'm going to go outside or tab mode for this.	O
We're going to go up.	CHITCHAT
We're going to move it up.	O
And then remove it around the X.	O
King, Alright, Let's look at it from the top.	O
We are for sure intersecting that.	O
This is going to be amazing.	CHITCHAT
I'm so excited.	CHITCHAT
So excited, so if I wanted to yeah to shade this mood I could definitely do that.	O
But Move shade.	O
No, you actually have to like there we go and this is being.	O
Silly.	CHITCHAT
So there you go.	CHITCHAT
If I wanted to do like a smooth shading kind of thing, but we're not going to be staying.	O
We're not doing this 'cause we're going into paper.	O
Oh goodness, uh, it's going to be very interesting making this like Dome.	O
Out of paper.	O
So I'm not I'm not really looking forward to that, just so we can all be clear on that.	O
Yeah, OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
So let's just go ahead.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go ahead and like.	O
'cause right now it looks like a golf thing.	O
Right, OK, so now what we need to do is I'm going to go ahead.	O
I'm going to select everything.	O
No, let's go ahead and select everything.	O
Let's go ahead and move all of that to the sensor origin except for that, because for some reason did not want to move.	O
That's cool, you know you do you.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're going to go ahead, select all.	O
I keep doing good morning briel minds technologies in Dubai.	CHITCHAT
Good morning.	CHITCHAT
I know it's not in the morning for you.	CHITCHAT
It has to be like lunchtime.	CHITCHAT
Right for sure.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so whenever you see anything like this happening when you're working with blender, see how like there is a texture here.	O
It's called the finding and what that means is that there are two meshes that are identical or does not necessarily mean tickle, but two messages right on top of each other.	O
So yeah.	O
And so now you can see that it's going alright, cool, so let's go ahead and look up on the top.	O
and I want to make sure.	O
That I placed this pretty OK an I like it.	O
I'm still trying to figure out whether or not I'm going to want this in a different color or not.	O
I'm not sure.	O
But what I do know is I definitely like how this is.	O
I'm going to go ahead and shift D to duplicate that and move it to the Y.	O
That didn't work at all.	O
Come on shifty.	CHITCHAT
Haha, now you're working.	CHITCHAT
Good job.	CHITCHAT
Glad glad you're working.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now we have two, so now I kind of have my top or what I'm probably going to do is squish the top a little bit, uhm, but we're not going to do that right now.	O
what I want to do, however, is I want to.	CHITCHAT
I want to.	O
Turn this on.	O
And I'm going to have this fear cool and I want to subtract it now, right?	O
So whenever I'm creating the this, I have like a whole that my Grill is going to go into from a paper crafts perspective.	O
OK, so I'm going to click this.	O
I'm going to add modifier and go back to Boolean or Bo Layan or Boo Boo lean.	O
I don't know how you say These things.	O
Uh, but it's OK, I don't need to know how to say it.	O
I just need to know what it does.	O
OK, I'll stop.	CHITCHAT
That's really funny.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to go ahead and apply.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's why that's not working.	O
I'm gonna go ahead and apply you too.	O
There you go.	O
We're all applied.	O
Happy family.	CHITCHAT
Ah Boom Shaka Laka.	CHITCHAT
See before I was moving it and it wasn't moving together because it was being rude but at the same time out didn't tell it to apply itself so therefore that didn't happen.	O
Alright, so let me go ahead and turn on my sphere.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to go ahead and move my spear.	O
So we can we can see.	O
Nearest well there was supposed to their whole there.	O

Believe it.	O
There we go.	O
All right and then this one, I think is going to need to move up a tiny hair.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Definitely a lot smoother.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
No, not that way.	O
So you can hold down shift if you need to do a little bit more of minute adjustments.	O
Alright, so I'm I'm feeling that a little bit more.	O
I feel like that that feels more right, OK?	O
All right, so the next thing that we need to do is alright.	O
Take a swig of your coffee.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys have some coffee.	CHITCHAT
Take a swig of it.	CHITCHAT
Cheers.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh So good, alright cool.	CHITCHAT
So now what I want to do is I want to go ahead and have like I want to do a handle.	O
And I think that's it.	O
I think maybe what will do is it will do a handle.	O
Uhm, I was also thinking what would it would be really funny to do like a hamburger in between the two?	O
Or do you like a big giant one?	O
But let's just go ahead and do a.	O
Let's just go ahead and do a big like whatever that is called.	O
OK, so we're going to go ahead.	O
We're going to shift a we're going to create a cube and let's just go ahead and move the cube over here.	O
We're going to hit tab.	O
First and foremost, this this cube is absolutely too big, so we're going to hit like scale.	O
And let's go ahead and move it somewhat in position.	O
Alright, I'm going to look down on this.	O
Alright, so it is kinda.	O
Little G will do it like here.	O
Alright cool, and now let's just look at it from the top or from the side.	O
OK, alright, so we definitely need to.	O
Oops that was wrong.	CHITCHAT
What is happening?	CHITCHAT
I'm moving it, I don't even know that I'm moving it.	O
Alright, so GX this way.	O
Boo alright we good we good we got this alright cool alright.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of go underneath it.	O
Click three to get this face going and we're going to extrude that down.	O
Boom, Alright wow, that's really interesting placement.	O
Alright cool but whatever?	O
So let's go ahead and select the whole thing.	O
Let's scale it down just to leave it 'cause it still feels a little.	O
A little Cray Cray.	O
Alright, so where do we want this?	O
Let's just do it on The X Axis or the Y axis will do it on the.	O
On the Y axis.	O
The why is the Green X is the red way that I remember that is because normally when you seen X you associated with red.	O
So that's just how I do it and helps me out alot.	O
Alright, Alright so we have that that's cool.	O
We're going to go ahead an uhm.	O
Take this.	O
Fat face and we're going to extrude it along the Y Axis Boo.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and actually.	O
Grow at a little less.	O
Alright, and now I'm going to extrude a little bit more.	O
This isn't going to be perfect, but.	O
I don't really care that much.	O
We try and do this quick yo.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, sweet.	CHITCHAT
Alright sweet, so we have our handle.	O
what I need to do now though is like let's go ahead.	O
And we're going to.	O
IDK, screw extrude and scale.	O
Wow, not that way at all.	O
That's that's really different than what I wanted.	O
Cool, cool, cool.	CHITCHAT
Cool, you know what I need to do?	O
We need to extrude.	O
Normal.	O
Extrude scale along normals.	O
Actually, why don't we just extrude along normals?	O

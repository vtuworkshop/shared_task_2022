Wow, that's really not doing what I thought it would do.	O
I mean, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
It's like going kind of below it a little bit, but I want the handles to be a wee bit bigger.	O
I mean, I could do that.	O
Let's let's.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's do this.	O
But if you this is not this is extrude extrude along normals.	O
Yes please.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, there we go.	CHITCHAT
That's just that's right there.	O
That's what I wanted.	O
I don't know why you didn't do that before.	O
It's OK though.	CHITCHAT
I forgive you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, sweet, so let's look at it from the front.	O
Alright, let's look at it from the side.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Guys.	CHITCHAT
Going to be so Keogh as it's gonna take forever to make.	O
OK, sweet, So what do we need to do now?	CHITCHAT
Uh, is we need to.	O
Let's look at this from a wire frame perspective.	O
You can see that this leg right here is not going in nearly as much.	O
Granted, it doesn't need to.	O
But it would be nice for it to be kind of even right.	O
Um, so let's go back into tab.	O
And so we're going to go ahead and select this one.	O
Alright, and we're just going to grow that on the Z.	O
Just oh I I did not select.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
I just want.	CHITCHAT
Wondering alright cool, so let's go back to three.	O
Alright Jeezy.	CHITCHAT
Not Jay-Z.	CHITCHAT
Is that not connected?	O
That's really weird that just that.	O
Is going alright, so we're just going to go.	O
Oh, because it's I see what I see.	O
What happens?	CHITCHAT
Area code, so we have that and so now what I want to do is I want to select this face right here and I just want to grow it out just to her.	O
I mean they don't need to be level at all.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Edges would be nice if they were somewhat close, right?	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Now let's go out.	O
We're going to name this or handle and oh, alright, so we're going to go ahead and do the negative again.	O
So we're going to click.	O
This we're going to add are modifier boolean.	O
Still don't really know what that is, but whatever.	O
Difference.	O
Apply.	O
Alright, so now when we're looking at our top of her grill we should have holes in it.	O
Boom, we have holes.	O
We have holes now.	O
Why did the holes go inward like I don't?	O
I don't know what's happening there.	O
Like I don't kinda OK.	O
Let's what is difference intersect?	O
But that just gives me the intersection, right?	O
Let's Let's just do this.	O
Intersect.	O
With a handle.	O
Oh wow, yeah.	O
So that's definitely not what I wanted.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
All right, let's go back in there, baby.	O
Alright, so we definitely want the difference difference.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
And we shall apply it alright, cool.	O
So now we have.	O
For Grill We have a grill.	O
Top.	O
Oh I have a real top.	O
We have a handle.	O
We have the bottom.	O
And we have the bottom alright, so that's what we're having right now.	O
We don't have the like sensor part, but that's fine, but we do I mean, it kind of looks like we're going to have to end up creating like this little extra lip here and then.	O
Also, like any plaques or anything like, I think that black right there.	O
That's where it says Weber like.	O
That would be a good place for us to be like number one, Quarantine Grill, master or something.	O
Or we could end up doing like something else like ever.	O
Alright?	CHITCHAT
So my other thought was.	O
Right, So what I want to do?	O
Is the handle and this I want to join together.	O

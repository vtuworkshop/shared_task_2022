Do you like so?	CHITCHAT
Is that like shift J or maybe Apple Jay?	O
I don't know but I want you to join together an I don't really know how you guys do that.	O
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
So one of the things I wanted to play with and I've never really done this before.	O
Is to add text.	O
I don't even really know outlook, there's my text.	O
Text cool.	CHITCHAT
So like, how do you change your text 'cause I thought it would be really cool to do a one.	O
But I quite literally have never done this before.	O
I don't even know how to like edit the text, how to change the font of the text?	O
It just quite literally just says text.	O
Oh, do you change it in here?	O
Oh, I'm typing.	O
Number.	O
Let's just do one.	O
That does not look like.	O
That that does not look like a one.	O
Alright sweet so you know what we're going to do.	O
We don't have time we're not going to play with this, but we will learn that that's going to be another thing that will learn.	O
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to go ahead and save this.	O
We're going to go ahead to an export this out as a OBJ.	O
But I only want the things I'm going to select exported, so we'll see what ends up happening.	O
Alright, so file.	O
Export OBJ.	O
All right, so we're going to.	O
Yep, Yep, alright everything's exported the way that it supposed to.	O
Alright, sweet, so now we're going to go to the magic maker.	O
And folder, oh, I was doing a creeper for my daughters.	O
And my son.	O
So never mind this creeper, we love you very much goodbye.	O
All right, so we're going to do a new one.	O
And always opens up like real tiny like real real tiny, right?	O
So I'm going to choose an OBJ file, which is why I didn't.	O
Oh BJ.	O
Blender.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
This is gonna be so fun.	CHITCHAT
Alright so inches alright, so how big do we want this whole thing up?	O
Yeah, it looks.	O
Easy, I'm so excited.	O
I should not be this excited oh man.	CHITCHAT
OK, uhm.	CHITCHAT
So let's just let's like I don't worry about the height.	O
Let's just do like 5 inches.	O
Oh, that does not seem like it's very tall at all.	O
Alright, let's change this.	O
Then to 7 inches.	O
We need to change this to 8 1/2 by 11 so I know like actually buy like proportion.	O
I can kind of see like what we're dealing with right?	O
Is this this is 2.	O
All Right, This is one.	O
This is one.	O
Here are these are the little bits that go into the holes right there that we will not be doing.	O
Alright, so that's the bottom base.	O
That's the bottom base.	O
I can see by 'cause whenever you're selecting it, it's going to change OC right here.	O
That's that right there.	O
That's that.	CHITCHAT
Out this is part of the handle and this is part of the handle that's dope.	O
I'm glad they separated it because that means that I can make that top part at different color.	O
Alright, so but this is.	O
There's two of these.	O
Which I don't really understand why there's two of these, but there are two of these, and so I will probably not do that Alright, and this is going to be a lot of scoring.	O
I can tell so.	O
What I'm thinking about you can see all of these little tiny lines.	O
Here are scorelines.	O
And I'm really tempted to like actually get rid of those score lines and then just kind of like.	O
He glue them.	O
That's probably what we're going to do.	O
All right, but you know what?	O
This is still pretty small.	O
This is only three pieces of paper, so let's go ahead and.	O
'cause I mean not 90 inches tall.	O
Holy granola, 9 inches.	O
There you go.	O
I feel like this this is a little bit better 'cause this is going to be big.	O
Now I think it would be really cool if I could do like a one in there or a hamburger.	O
I was also thinking about doing like a little hamburger in there too, but I'm going to.	O
I'm going to do it separately.	O
We're only going to do this on camera and then from there were like move on and see how things go.	O

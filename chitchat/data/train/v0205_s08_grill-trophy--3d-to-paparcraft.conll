OK, cool, so let's go ahead and start getting ready for exporting this to be cut.	O
But first we're going to have to clean up everything.	O
It's just going to be a lot easier to select all these strokes if they are the same color.	O
So I went ahead and did that so now everything that strokes you can see they're pink.	O
A man and a lot of these strokes we're just going to go ahead and get rid of 'cause frankly we do not need 'em.	O
We need him on the box things and we're going to need 'em over here.	O
But all of this mess we're not going to need him.	O
We're only going to Needham really where the tabs are on the front and the back.	O
Alright sweet, so now that we have this, we're going to go ahead and export.	O
As VG.	O
Alright, So what do we want to export?	O
I just want to export the cutting lines the Ridge fold lines and the Valley fold lines that is it optimized for CNC cutting.	O
Cool Untitled Grill Trophy.	O
Now what we're going to do is that we're going to do this one at a time.	O
Meaning if I sat here and did this next phase, if I sat here and did this all an illustrator and then tried to cut everything, it would just take too long.	O
And you guys would be watching me fix things and that's just not.	O
That's not fun, but what I'm going to do.	O
So I exported everything as a SVG.	O
I am now opening it in over Adobe illustrator.	O
An you can see pretty much this is what we had right now.	O
Some of these things I already know I am not going to even mess with so that I'm going to delete.	O
These items are going to delete and what I really like about him is that everything was exported.	O
Everything was exported with the colors that I wanted, and then on top of that everything was exported as group.	O
So if I select one circuit you can see that all of that is groups, which is really nice or really really nice.	O
Alright, sweet.	CHITCHAT
So what we're going to do is that we're going to focus on come, oh, this is the problem with using different software that's made by two different companies because what ends up happening is that you learn the.	O
Hotkeys for one and then you try to end up using those hotkeys for the other in.	O
It doesn't work sometimes you actually can get very much in trouble.	O
All right, So what I'm going to do?	CHITCHAT
And for some reason, what I really am not enjoying currently is that my um.	O
Right, so I'm going to X those out.	O
I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to put those on a new layer because that's we're essentially just going to mess with these OK.	O
And then we're going to zoom in.	O
My illustrator has been very laggy, so I got an external processor like graphics processor an while it's been kind of nice.	O
On some things it it does not.	O
Do very well with illustrator for some odd reason.	O
Alright, so I'm gonna go ahead and take this black line.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put it underneath OK and you can see now.	O
That there there's two that's happening, so we have this.	O
That's a cut.	O
We have And this that's a cut.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and select those and then this is what I'm talking about like.	O
I could if I wanted to, just go ahead and put this into the cricket.	O
Which is what I used to cut.	O
But it would be.	O
Frankly, would be horrible.	O
Alright, so what's happening here is these little black lines here.	O
Are not connected.	CHITCHAT
2.	O
Are not connected.	O
So essentially.	O
I have to go in and clean these up which.	O
As you can see, is a pain in.	O
In the booty.	O
All right, So what I'm going to do here is just.	O
Penny come here.	O
'cause either tabs that are running into the main paper shape and so they overlap them.	O
And so this is where I'm really glad that I have.	O

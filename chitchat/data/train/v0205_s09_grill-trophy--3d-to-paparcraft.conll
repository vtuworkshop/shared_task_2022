I have a lot of experience making paper things because I can look at something and figure out like OK this.	O
Needs to change.	O
Alright so.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
All right, so let's go ahead and we're going to.	O
Turn this over, but I'm going to put this underneath the pink so I can kind of see.	O
Oh my gosh, why aren't you going underneath?	O
Arrange center back.	O
That's what I'm doing.	O
So frustrating.	CHITCHAT
All right, and then where is this?	O
OK, where is this line?	O
So frustrating.	CHITCHAT
Because essentially what's happening is what happened to all those ones that I just made.	O
Alright, so there's that.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
This is frustrating, right?	O
So right now all of these pink guys.	O
In the middle, need to go away.	O
'cause I don't want.	O
I want to be a smooth cone.	O
I don't want it to have.	O
The strokes now.	O
The reason why these strokes are here.	O
Is because.	O
When you do anything with 3D, it creates it off of geometry and polygons.	O
And so whenever I would made a circle, it made 32 vertices, which means whenever I expanded it is now 30 two faces.	O
So I have to delete 32.	O
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
This is just this.	O
This is the part that sucks the most.	O
Everything else is really fast and then you do this and it's like it's just so slow.	O
And that's why I was telling you like.	O
OK guys, we're not going to be doing this.	O
All right, and you know what?	O
what I might end up doing OK.	O
Alright, so we have this.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
All of these lines here.	O
I don't even know where this like the word this ends.	O
So I'm going to go ahead and lock that.	O
'cause I'm trying to find out so I locked it.	O
I'm trying to find out where this.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm just going to go ahead and delete this one.	O
And somebody new faster way to do this.	O
I'm like all game.	O
This is where.	O
All right, so if I click the bottom of that, it should just extend.	O
All I want to do.	O
As essentially continue these strokes, I don't want to make a new one, which is what happened earlier and the way that I can see that the strokes are actually being.	O
Connected is because I'm getting.	O
Alright, where is this?	CHITCHAT
I'm getting this little tiny next to my cursor.	O
I'm getting a circle with a line through it right next to my pin tool.	O
And that let's me know.	O
That I'm connecting these.	O
Which is the whole point.	O
But then it's really hard to like.	O
See where you're going.	O
Alright, so now why are you pink?	O
That was apparently that was wrong.	O
Whatever one I just did that was wrong.	O
Alright, so now if I select this an I turn it around.	O
OK, it still doing that weird thing so frustrated.	O
Then I just end up making a whole new path.	O
He did, but that's not what I wanted to do.	O

I'm so frustrated, y'all.	CHITCHAT
You can see where it needs to go.	O
All right at this point.	O
Let me change this color so I can kind of see where it needs to go, so that's green.	O
Alright, so I'm going to this is what I'm going to do.	O
I'm connecting these two things.	O
These two black pieces I'm going to pass find them union fi.	O
Select it, move it to the back.	O
Right, and then I'm going to take this.	O
I'm going to outline that stroke.	O
And then I'm going to subtract it.	O
So now it's going to cut those.	O
Who knows who knows how it's going, how it's going to work, but what, whatever, at this point, Alright cool.	O
Alright, so now what we're going to do?	O
And then I select those, put it in the back.	O
Select everything.	O
And at that juncture, everything should be pink.	O
If it's only turn everything green, I'm just going to like look at it and make sure that everything is right.	O
Yeah, it is OK.	CHITCHAT
And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to outline those strokes, and then I'm going to Union File Union by them.	O
And then I'm going to group it.	O
Right, and so now I have one part of this whole entire thing that's ready to be cut.	O
I didn't mean to move you.	O
So yeah, so it it quite literally is.	O
That tiring.	O
Alright cool, so that one might be way harder than this one.	O
This guy looks like he actually might be pretty easy.	O
All right, so we're going to again.	O
Do this.	O
Path find.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
There should be fine this.	O
Should work.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
I don't know why it's in all these different pieces.	O
But it's OK.	CHITCHAT
All right and then what is happening here?	O
Oh Man, I'm telling you.	O
Ever since I got this GPU, it's really messing up on my on illustrator.	O
Holy granola.	CHITCHAT
What is happening?	CHITCHAT
I'm at.	O
48 thousand 32,000.	O
16,000 percent, 12,008 thousand OK.	O
Alright, that took a minute alright?	O
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
I love how I always sound like oh this should be easy.	O
We scoff at you, Sir.	O
All right now.	CHITCHAT
Move back.	O
This is ridiculous.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	O
You know how many times I had to push apples in order for that to move back.	O
Like this is so slow, I want to change this back 'cause This is ridiculous, OK?	O
Alright, so there is definitely something that's happening here.	O
I don't know what this is.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what this is.	O
Not.	CHITCHAT
I think it's supposed to be gone.	O
So I'm just going to have to like Fudge Nugget.	O
You're not supposed to go anywhere, where are you going?	O
Alright cool, alright, so let's go ahead and select this an essentially what we're going to have to do is that we're going to have to connect all of this stuff, so I'm going to start here.	O
Anne, I pretty much know these are.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to.	CHITCHAT
That's so frustrating.	O
Now we want that.	O
I don't know why it's making it pink.	O
I'm so frustrated.	CHITCHAT
OK, that's alright.	CHITCHAT
Move on moving on.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Pretty much what I'm going to end up doing is connecting all of this.	O
Pain.	CHITCHAT

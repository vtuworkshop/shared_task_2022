Nikita, super thankful that you're here an laughing alongside with me on all this because it is.	CHITCHAT
That's the only way I can deal with it right now.	CHITCHAT
Is laughing.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Now for real, this you guys were supposed to be connected.	O
You were supposed to be best friends.	O
But you're not.	O
It's OK.	CHITCHAT
No, don't don't do anything.	O
So if you guys are just tuning in, what I'm doing is I created something in 3D.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm transferring it into a paper model and the paper model is currently hating me.	O
And that's OK.	CHITCHAT
We don't need to be best friends in order to for it to be a paper model, it just needs to kind of obey me a little bit since I am it's maker, uhm?	O
So that's that's really where we are right now.	O
I'm going to have to.	CHITCHAT
I like how it wants to actually play now.	O
Oh my goodness.	CHITCHAT
Did you just see that it went away?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
This is what we're going to do.	O
We're going to go to application.	O
You're going to go to illustrator.	O
Get information.	O
I am not going to prefer external GPU.	O
No, not even that.	O
Been horrible is not worked well.	O
Now let's see if my thing is recovered.	O
Kinda doubt it.	O
But you know it's a thing.	O
Yes.	O
I hope changing it on the other GPU really kind of helped.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Ha, thank you alright, let's go ahead and save it.	O
No, I don't want to send any.	CHITCHAT
Yeah sure will save it as that cool alright?	O
Alright, so let's see I just changed it from the from the other GPU to my onboard GPU.	O
And already I can tell is so much smoother, it's ridiculous.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go out and then I'm going to go here to connect that look at their alright and then we're going to.	O
I drop this black boom.	O
All right now with this and then and then.	O
And then we're going to send backwards.	O
OK, and then we have this little guy here.	O
I don't really know what's going on with him, but I don't.	O
I know I don't want him.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what's going on with him, I just know he doesn't need to be there.	O
But you know what I can just come out later.	O
Alright, what else is happening?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so there needs to be a Divit there, but we'll figure all that stuff out.	O
Alright, cool, So what I'm going to do now is.	O
I am going to select all the black pieces here.	O
We're going to Union five, then union by.	O
Phil.	CHITCHAT
Are you guys union fight?	CHITCHAT
Yes you are OK now I'm just going to run my.	O
Mouse.	O
Along the center.	O
I'm going to delete those items.	O
Everything else I want to go ahead and outline stroke and union five that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I'm thinking I need to do.	O
Like a wee little away, a little tab right here.	O
So I'm just going to go ahead and.	O
Select these two pieces.	O
Out.	O
Did I dialogue, yeah.	O
OK, well you know what?	O
Sometimes they want to play nicely and sometimes they just want to be Meanie heads.	O
did I lock it?	CHITCHAT
What is happening?	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Let's move used to that.	O
Alright, so what's This?	CHITCHAT
This looks like it's, uh.	CHITCHAT

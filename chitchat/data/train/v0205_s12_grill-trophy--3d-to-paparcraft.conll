Path where it's going to be cut, but that's fine whatever?	O
Alright, let's go ahead and move this to the back and then bam we have two pieces that are ready to be cut.	O
So let's just go ahead.	CHITCHAT
We're going to do.	CHITCHAT
This three pieces and then from there we're going to do is that we were going to go ahead and get these cutting.	O
So while this is cutting I can.	O
I'll go ahead and get all the other stuff ready to be cut as well, right?	O
So if you guys remember.	CHITCHAT
With this one going to be easy.	CHITCHAT
10 praise Jesus.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool, so now we're going to.	CHITCHAT
We're going to lock that we're going to take my.	O
Alright delete, select all the pink.	O
Pathfinder the pink unlock the black.	O
Move the black to the back.	O
Did I asked, did I ask that?	CHITCHAT
Oh, did I delete my pink?	O
Don't don't delete.	CHITCHAT
Don't delete it.	CHITCHAT
Pathfinder cool.	O
Alright unlock.	O
Why are you not going to the back dude?	O
Did I die?	CHITCHAT
Get rid of my paint now the pink is there.	O
It's just the pink.	O
A different color now.	O
Ah, that's what's happening.	CHITCHAT
That is what's happening alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now we have our three pieces that are about to be cut.	O
Did not take forever.	O
I know that you guys are like super glad that you sat through all of that facetious.	O
Anyway, alright, so we're going to go ahead to our asset export.	O
The biggest thing is I need to make sure that whenever I click these that they're all grouped, 'cause otherwise it's going to be a big pain in the booty.	O
So then I'm going to group them individually, but then also together.	O
And this is going to be our trophy base.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead.	O
Export this and it's going to go ahead and create an SVG.	O
Thing for me, which is super nice.	O
All right and then now you guys get to see my exciting cricket in our face.	O
Now if there's ever an interface I feel like needs to get better.	O
It is this cricket one.	O
However, it is what it is.	O
Alright, let's go to Grill Trophy.	O
Let's go to SVG.	O
Let's go to base.	O
Dropped at various face.	O
OK, I'll stop save.	O
Alright, so because I transferred everything to an SVG, it is going to be its proper color or proper size.	O
They don't have to re scale anything which is really good.	O
Alright, and so at this juncture I have to let every like I have to let it know.	O
A this needs to be.	O
This is a score.	O
This is a cut.	O
And this cord goes with this cut.	O
So that's essentially what I'm doing right now.	O
Alright, so we have one and we have two done.	O
Now we're going to go ahead to this guy.	O
All Right, This is a score and This is why I like to have the cuts always be a different color than the scores because it's just a lot easier when you're going through all of this.	O
All right, all right now we can megas.	O
It.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
These are this is very tab heavy.	O
Alright, so I have eight half by 11.	O
Let's move this.	O
I have eight half by 11 uhm.	O
Paper, so that's what we're going to use, and you can kind of notice that whenever it puts it in there, it's not necessarily the most uhm.	O
The way they put it together and it's just, it's just not very space friendly.	O
All right, So what I'm going to do now?	O
Is that I need to put the paper on to the thing, so this is the paper that I have.	O
You can see that it is definitely has a fun specularity to it.	O
Also has does have like a bit of a grain to it as well, but the thing about this paper is that it's thick so it's going to hold but it's also kind of Foamy and when I say foamy I mean like made a phone, not like soap bubbles like Foamy and so that it ends up creating this really interesting dynamic.	O
When you try to glue it together so and when you try to cut it, because it's actually very.	O
Very, very dense.	O
So I'm going to go ahead and feed it into this machine, which is slightly off camera.	O

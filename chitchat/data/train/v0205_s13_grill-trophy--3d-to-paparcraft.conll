And then there are two different.	O
There's actually a way more than I have, but I have two pieces, two tools that I use.	O
This is the blade tool which has a blade at the end of it and this is the score tool which has, like a little Rotary blade, but it's not, it's blunt, so it just creates the indentions and doesn't cut it for me.	O
Alright, so now going back to the screen.	O
We are ready to go ahead and give this a cut.	O
But It is coffee time.	CHITCHAT
So good alright?	CHITCHAT
Just a reminder.	CHITCHAT
What are we doing today?	CHITCHAT
We are in the weekly challenge at the hand streamers have which is creating something that's called the corn Tina Ward.	O
So this is just what we're doing this week.	O
Next week might be something different, but I'm going to be doing these kind of peppered into the Hearthstone card recreates just to kind of keep things interesting, maybe more for me than for you.	O
Who knows, but anyway, So what we're going to do is that we're making a grill that's on top of a trophy because for.	O
Our family when we were deep within our quarantine, we rediscovered our love for grilling and specifically hamburgers, so I thought it would be fun to make a trophy for all of that.	O
So you guys have already seen me created in blender, which is this free or shareware, but it's free 3D modeling software, which is it is really big to learn, but you can totally do it.	O
Re transferred it into UN folder, which is an application that like changes 3D modeling software and unfolds it into a paper template.	O
So we saw you guys saw that and now I am in illustrator making those a little bit more friendly for me to be able to put together and we're about to cut them which I'm really excited about.	O
Now I know you guys probably thought I was only sending my spiel, but I want to let you guys know that Hey, we have a discord just for us makers, right?	O
So we're the ones that like you guys do.	O
3D printing.	O
You guys do foam clay modeling.	O
You guys do I think we have some.	O
Yeah, we have some horns in there that someone's making we had somebody do some really cool.	O
Where is it?	CHITCHAT
Papercraft Leica Leica stop animation like papercraft kind of thing which is like super super cool.	O
So anyway we would love to get to know you also on top of that I put in Crafter and Spirit Crafter or maker inspiration.	O
So these are people that are either interested in learning or doing or dabbling in or inspired by anything that's handmade so.	O
Anyway, if you guys are interested in that, I'm going to go ahead.	O
I'm going to copy this and then I'm going to put it in the chat.	O
So if you guys are interested in joining that you are.	CHITCHAT
More than welcome.	CHITCHAT
Now just so you guys.	CHITCHAT
Now if you do start discriminating or cussing or anything like that, you are going to get booted pretty quickly 'cause I don't put up with any of that stuff at all.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool, so we're going to go ahead, do or pressure.	O
More.	O
And then with this we're going to go ahead and get this going.	O
So now what?	CHITCHAT
You guys don't see that on my machine there is a button over here.	O
This flashing that saying, hey, let's go come on.	O
Alright, so now you guys are going to hear that in the background as we move on to our other pieces.	O
So sorry, that's going to be loud while it's cutting.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Where are our other pieces are over here, so layer one is done.	O
So we're going to go ahead and move to now.	O
I really do think that this is quite literally the same thing.	O
123456.	O
Yeah, this is the same thing, so I'm going to go ahead and delete this one again.	O
You guys saw that there was a bit of a duplication that was happening, so whatever, alright?	O
So we're going to go ahead and cut that.	O
We're going to put that on its new layer.	O
It's just easier when I'm just focused on one.	O
Yeah, I know a lot of people were like, Oh man, somebody who actually uses.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Someone who actually uses the layers tool in illustrator, that's crazy.	O
I'm going to ungroup it an I'm going to do things a little bit differently because this is going to be pretty easy.	O
We're going to go ahead and select all the things that are pink.	O
We're going to go ahead and outline that, and then we're going to union fry them.	O
So that was really easy an in this guy really should translate pretty nicely.	O

No idea why he separate.	O
But he's also not connected.	O
I can see.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to select these black individual pieces and put them down and then I am going to need to essentially.	O
Finish this 'cause this needs to be connected right here.	O
Alright, so I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
So like these two black pieces alright come on that piece, yes, and this did I just make that one piece so I did automatically boom.	O
Alright, so we put that underneath.	O
Alright, so that was insanely easy.	CHITCHAT
All right, and you guys already heard it is done.	O
Believe it or not.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to do is I'm going to take the scoring tool out and now I'm going to do the cutting tool.	O
Alright, so we have one piece that's already ready for it to go.	O
Alright cool, so I'm just going to go ahead and turn this layer off and go back to my OG layer.	O
Who all right now now we got these.	O
I'm going to go ahead and delete this guy too, 'cause we don't need him.	O
Let's go ahead and do the years we're going to do the easy guys KK, I'm going to move over here since this one is already done.	O
Alright, based.	O
Then Cool, I have a hole there.	O
Why is that whole there?	O
I'm really interested to see why that hold their.	O
I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
What did I do?	CHITCHAT
What in the world did I do?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so this I want to imagine that this guy is one piece.	O
Let's let's flip em.	O
Yes, he is cool alright, but you guys saw that there were.	O
There is definitely a hole there.	O
I don't know why I don't remember.	O
Doing anything that's inset with the handle itself.	O
So that's really interesting.	O
So we're going to see where that where that takes us.	O
All right, so we're going to go ahead and push that back, and then all these pink items.	O
We definitely need these strokes.	O
So we're going out like them and then unify them, and then that is done.	O
Alright, so now we're going to go ahead and move to this these pieces.	O
Now we still haven't figured out the colors for it all.	O
I kinda wanna do classic red on top.	O
I think that would be kind of cool.	O
Um, Alright Oh man, look at that is just so nice when.	O
Everything.	O
Connects like that.	O
Alright, so that one is ready to go.	O
And you guys can hear that it is already done cutting.	O
Believe it or not.	CHITCHAT
Now the reason why it didn't take very long.	O
Is because.	O
I fixed it up in illustrator if I didn't it would.	O
It would have been here for like another another while.	O
Alright, so that to me then speaks that it is time to export these items.	O
So we can keep this cutting train going alright, so.	O
S export.	O
Alright, so this is.	CHITCHAT
Trophy.	O
Stem.	O
Ann Handles cool.	O
Alright, so maybe.	O
What I'm wondering is that, like maybe the things that go like the bot like these side things can be gold.	O
And this can be read if I want the rest of everything to be read.	O
I think maybe that's what we do all right.	O
do I have all Fudge Nugget?	O
All right, so we're having a moment over here.	O
Let me show you.	O
The paper is not supposed to be like this.	O
It is supposed to say onto the mat, but because this is a foam paper, it's kind of crazy.	O
So when I thought it was done in fact actually.	O
I'm getting a red light.	O

I don't know if you guys can see that I'm getting a red error light.	O
It tried to eat my paper.	O
What against trophies?	O
Do you have cricket?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so this pretty much just means that like I have to be mean and kind of.	O
Figure out how to pull this out.	O
Oh look at that guys.	CHITCHAT
The score marks are so nice.	O
Alright, so I'm going to turn it of- all right now.	O
I might, even though, like this, still feels pretty sticky.	O
I'm going to get a new one, just in case, because this guy feels like.	O
Like maybe he'll be good for paper, but not now.	O
This is way more sticky.	O
Alright, so we're going to do this again.	O
But I also need to find my squeegee.	O
We do where are you OK so?	O
If I can't find my squeegee, I always use a credit card, but I know you guys might want to.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Not saying you, but you know the other people that are mean they might want to use my card numbers like I make sure that I like really cover that up right?	CHITCHAT
So well, the good news is I guess we're not done cutting so I can keep going, but we're definitely going to need to go back to the screen and tell it to like.	O
A cancel.	O
And redo all of that again.	O
OK Boo, Let's do this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do more.	O
I got the score.	O
OK, it's ready.	CHITCHAT
It's like Alright, Mom, I'm ready to try again.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's right cricket you do it.	O
You can.	CHITCHAT
I believe in you.	CHITCHAT
OK cool so here we go.	CHITCHAT
Hooley granola holy granola.	CHITCHAT
This is going to be hard.	O
Uh, I'm like so tempted to essentially just get rid of the pink one that I don't want an let cricket do its thing and see what happens.	O
Alright, so essentially what I'm doing now is all the score lines that I do not want and then get rid of.	O
So I want the scorelines that helped me, um, determine what my tags are and the score lines that help determine, like where is bending horizontally, but these vertical ones I do not need because we're not I don't want this to be a like.	O
Polygonal looking?	O
Grill That's not, that's not the point.	O
I also really afraid to see what it would look like if I.	O
Oh my gosh, if I turn this black and white like if I turn this stroke.	O
Into a fill.	O
That's not that bad, but I'm really not into it right now.	O
I really don't.	CHITCHAT
I really don't want to do it.	O
So what we're going to do, though, is that we can combine in order to make this like.	O
Easy in the set up alright good OK cricket you got this alright Boo you can do this I believe in you.	O
Go show us how awesome you are.	O
OK, so I gave it a pep talk.	O
I think it's I think it's going to do good.	O
You know what I'm thinking?	O
Maybe these like this bottom one we keep.	O
All right, so here we go.	CHITCHAT
We're going to move to the side and you know what I need to do is we really do need to tackle these separately.	O
Because I'm going to do a select all function.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And if it's on the same layer and I do a select all, it's not.	O
It is not gonna is not going to like me.	O
All right, so here we go.	CHITCHAT

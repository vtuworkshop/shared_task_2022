Aren't you guys so glad.	CHITCHAT

It's like so stinking cute.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it uhm.	CHITCHAT
Patience man.	CHITCHAT
Patience and determination.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm looking over here and I'm really proud of our cricket.	O
It took our encouragement speech to heart and it's doing way better the second time around.	O
OK Alright.	CHITCHAT
So this is.	O
Taking forever and ever and ever.	O
The good news is if there's a bad part, we just put that in the back.	O
Now we need to see it.	O
OK, alright let's go ahead and hit save.	O
Alright, things are speeding up.	O
I feel maybe we're getting a little bit of traction here.	O
We still have 40 minutes.	CHITCHAT

Oh, I'm looking at my piece over here and it cut it.	O
I'm so proud of you little guy.	O
Right so because?	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to end up doing the whole.	O
What's happening like what's this?	O
Like there is this line, but there is not like A.	O
It doesn't finish it out for some reason.	O
So I I don't know what's happening so weird.	O
So every single time place you see a black line, that is where it's going to cut.	O
But then you can see over here, the Black Line disappears.	O
Which is.	CHITCHAT
Interesting.	CHITCHAT
Now it's changing it to pink.	O
We don't want it to be paying Boo.	O
So I'm going to have to kind of do it like on top of it or write like really close to it.	O
That sucks so.	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness.	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to connect here.	O
Alright cool.	CHITCHAT

Um, we're going to export because he's going to be.	O
This guy is going to be read to an part of the handles are going to be read, so we're going to go ahead and export all of these things together.	O

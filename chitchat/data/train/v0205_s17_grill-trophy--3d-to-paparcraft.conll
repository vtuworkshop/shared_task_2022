Alright, so now we're going to go ahead and just select one of these pink guys.	O
Select all same appearance so all my pinks are selected.	O
I'm going to outline all you cutie pinks.	O
And then we're going to pathfind you alright, sweet, so now we're going to group you.	O
And then I'm going to go ahead and open up my other layers that have my items as well.	O
And I know I went ahead and exported them.	O
But like as a group, but I'm going to go ahead and export these as a group just so whenever I import I only really have to import one.	O
So let's go ahead and delete you.	O
And then now at this point I'm just going to do trophy.	O
Trophy to just a copy.	O
Cool, I don't need to learn how to spell.	O
Spelling just slows you down.	O
OK, cool, so let's go ahead and to the space.	O
Yes, we're going ahead and dismiss you.	O
I'm going to cancel the cut because it's done.	O
Yes, we're in cancelled.	O
We're done 'cause we're done, we're done.	O
Cool, so all of these things.	CHITCHAT
That we superlove we're just going to go ahead and hide them all.	O
Now let's go ahead and upload.	O
Trophy 2 Alright, so.	O
And it's going to tell me that this file is big.	O
Largely because of all those old tiny like yeah wow, that's allergic image.	O
I know, alright, let's ungroup.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, where you where you at?	O
I understand you don't need to be mad at me, it's taken awhile, alright?	O
So First off let's go to this piece.	O
Alright, so I know this is a score.	O
And this is a cut, so I'm going to go ahead and attach those two.	O
And when I attach it in my UI, it automatically goes up top alright and so this is going to be gold, some actually going to do colors this time.	O
Alright, so now the next thing that's going to be gold is.	O
These pieces, so let's go ahead and get those done.	O
So we're going to go ahead and we're going to score that.	O
That's going to be a score 2.	O
Um, these two actually.	O
So this and this, if I can select those individually, those are going to be gold cool and these two things need to be attached because they are best friends and these two things need to be attached because they are best friends dope.	O

The score should be one file.	O

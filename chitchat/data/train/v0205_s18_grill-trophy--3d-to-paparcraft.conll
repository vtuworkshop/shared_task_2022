See that's why I like to clean it all up.	O
I tried to be lazy and it didn't work.	O
It didn't pan out.	O
That right there.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm just going to move it 'cause I'm.	O
OK, I'm so over it.	CHITCHAT
That's why I attached it to him and I found it.	O
Yeah, that's my scores.	O
Alright, cool and they're all pink.	O
See how their pink?	O
I found you owe.	O
I'm so glad.	CHITCHAT
Alright, and now since.	CHITCHAT
I select so now I can select everything and I can attach.	O
Now I can tell you right now this thing is going to take forever to cut.	O
Uh, so.	CHITCHAT
That's the good news.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so alright, so that's the pink.	O
Oh no I gotta like turn on everything else completely forgot.	O
All right, so let's go ahead and collapse that.	O
And let's turn on these other little friends of ours.	O
That we need to cut this time around.	O
OK, I'm going to make it.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we have our handle.	O
We have this which.	O
We're going to go ahead and just move move object.	O
Through this red 'cause we want you to be the same color.	O
And then we have these little guys.	O
These seemed so Teeny Tiny.	O
OK, so we're going to actually start with yellow, but let's go ahead and get.	O
This undone alright, So what I do it always is.	O
I bend the mat.	O
I've been them at, not the.	O
Not the peace 'cause you want the piece to come out flat.	O
Alright, so I'm trying to get this guy out, but there's a lot of like diesel tabs end up creating.	O
A lot of little points too.	CHITCHAT
A lot of Points of like friction.	O
Something that I'm learning 'cause right now I'm doing resin.	O
And one of the things that I've learned with frozen is that whenever you cast molds, you don't want to, just.	O
Cast the mold or like cut the mold out like straight you want to do the exact because whenever you're putting the resonant later on, it doesn't.	O
It doesn't seep out because I guess it locks and it creates more of a surface tension.	O
For something I don't know, but anyway, it's really neat.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
All right, so here we go.	CHITCHAT
So here's.	CHITCHAT
That I know this gold against this word is kind of hard to see.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
You have some really interesting negatives pieces though that I'm going to save.	O
OK, and then let's go ahead and get this other piece going.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so again, I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Anne is going to ask me too.	O
Do the score, so I'm going to go ahead and put that in there.	O
OK, let's go ahead and switch you guys to screen.	O
I'm going to more pressure.	O
Then we're going to go ahead and go alright, sweet.	O
So while that's going.	O
Just for the sake of the stream.	O
We're going to go ahead and start creating this base just because I know this is going to be more interesting to watch.	O
Then perhaps you know me trying to get another thing going on.	O
So we're going to go ahead and save you guys from all of that, but this over here to the side.	O
Let's get some coffee.	O
OK so I have my glue and I have my rag.	O

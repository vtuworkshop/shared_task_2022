All right, and so I do have these rags for Sale by the way.	O
You guys are interested in him there a rum.	O
This one has been through the ringer as you can see through like the paint and I have it like glued together and what not.	O
But anyway it's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
It's it says tally ho and then if his crafty frontiers away and then it has one of my brands on it.	O
So this was custom hand tie dyed and then screen printed and all that stuff in the studio by me.	O
And you can get those on Etsy.	CHITCHAT
So if you go to Etsy and you just look up UN stationary, so let me go ahead and write that word for you.	O
You guys can find you can find that that stuff.	O
Alright cool alright so here we have this piece that's the big problem really.	O
Was the way that this piece is is that.	O
Of these tabs are creating kind of a very like.	O
Blunt.	O
And so we just need to cut it to where only one is saying so the other ones we can wrap around it.	O
And it's the same for these as well.	O
We only need one to stay and I think that we have our one.	O
Alright cool now normally it's good to bend away from the score Mark and then it's also really good to train your paper.	O
Where you gonna be going so?	O
Going this way Alright, and then all these little tiny scores we need to push this down.	O
Now I'm using this paper again, is insanely sick so the score is probably not going to be the best, but.	O
It is what it is now.	CHITCHAT
One of the things that this unfold are does is that it's assuming that you're putting all the tabs on the inside of the paper, so you can't see it.	O
One of the things I like to do, however, is put the tabs on the outside using the paper that your wrapping around as a structural guide.	O
So for instance, if I'm trying to put these tabs here and I'm trying to glue him on the inside, you can see already that it's going to get kind of wonky, but if I glue him on the outside, I'm going to definitely get a perfect circle.	O
But what ends up happening is that when you do that.	O
You get a gap because your circumference at this juncture is is larger, right?	O
I don't mind the gap because there's always a part where you're going to see you're not going to see it.	O
It's going to be tored the back now granted.	O
If I was doing this for a client or for a movie set, I would definitely fix that gap, because I mean all it is really is adding 1/4 of an inch.	O
Generally speaking that's all it is.	O
But once you have the bottom down.	O
Once you have the bottom circumference down, it's going to be a lot easier to mold.	O
Actually, the circumference of the top.	O
Yeah so.	CHITCHAT
But this paper is not.	O
Really, let me like this is not very smooth, it's very bumpy.	O
So sometimes when it's like that, what I like to do is kind of create and I still might do this.	O
A band.	O
Like so something that's like this, this wide or tall and just kind of like another piece of paper.	O
Put it on top of it, which actually might be really cool, because if the if the.	O
Whatever it's called, if the grill is red, that's on top and we don't have a Red Accent on the bottom.	O
It could actually be very visually.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Heavy right on top, so it might be.	O
It might have some really nice balance if I end up doing a little red strip on the bottom, which is probably what's going to happen.	O
OK, cool, so this went ahead and got done.	CHITCHAT
Man, I'm making this really tiny are than I thought I was.	O
'cause these handles are Micro Scopic.	O
Look how tiny this handle is.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
Hum, we shall see how this goes.	CHITCHAT

Alright, and here is our red.	O
All right, so we're going to go ahead.	O
Put this in here.	O
Alright, it's gonna ask me for.	O
My score.	O
Some changing that, but I'm going to need to change the material, so just give me a second.	O
OK done.	O
Alright, so let's go ahead and glue these bottom tabs.	O
So what I'm going to do I already have the good kind of dripping out when I'm going to do is.	O
I'm just going to go ahead and put glue instead of on the tabs.	O
Normally I would put him on the tabs, but.	O
I think this might be a little bit faster for this one, and there's so many tabs, like quite literally, covering every single.	O
Surface.	O
All right and then what I'm going to do quite literally is I'm just pushing it.	O
I'm going to mold it and push a town.	O
am I going to get glue on the table?	O
Yes, I'm going to get glue on the table.	O
Do I mind now, because that's what my rag is for?	O
And then the one thing to about this phone paper is not only is it thick, but because of the material.	O
It's sometimes really hard to, or it's not hard, but it takes a little bit longer for the glue to adhere.	O
Now this is going to cut for a long time.	O
Alright, so now that that's done, what we're going to do is that we were going to glue this piece inside there so you guys can see that that's how it's going to go.	O
Right and this will tab.	O
Needs to come down.	O
All right, apparently needs to wait a little bit longer, so I'm just going to.	O
I have this is like a uhm embosser.	O
Kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just using it really to apply pressure.	O
All right, and so now with just done, I'm going to go ahead and put glue on the top tab.	O
Essentially, I'm squeezing just a little bit, but dabbing it because I don't.	O
I don't want a lot of glue, I don't want it to squeeze out.	O
Whenever I'm applying the pressure.	O
But I need to make sure that I'm old.	O
I'm old, everything to it.	O
So there you go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to go ahead and kind of.	O
Pushing down a little bit 'cause I want to make sure that this is.	O
Nice and clean.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
We have the base done, which is really nice.	O
Now we're going to go ahead an I guess we're going to move to this piece.	O
I guess this is the next piece is kind of like a.	O
It's like the layer piece, which honestly I should probably put that on.	O
Before I did this, but K Saras.	O
Which then kind of begs the question that I probably should put this piece on before I put that on, and then really I probably should put this piece in here before I put that on.	O
So we're just going to go ahead and just going to go ahead and start here.	O
Alright, so this is our fun little trophy.	O
Based.	O
Alright, I see how that's going to go.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
This is a little tiny tab.	O
Send that down.	O
Alright, alright cool, so I'm going to go ahead and put glue.	O
Oh, scoring is done.	O
Time for it to cut.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT

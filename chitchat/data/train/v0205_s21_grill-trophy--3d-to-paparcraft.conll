All right got it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so while that is holding, I'm just going to kind of pinch it together.	O
I want to I want to pinch it down.	O
I want to make sure that that's flat.	O
So I want this to be nice and flush.	O
It's going to go into here.	O
And so I need to make sure that.	O
It's nice and tight, or it's not going to be able to fit in the space that.	O
Just because we 3D printed it doesn't mean that human error is not going to happen, right?	O
Alright, so I need to go ahead and put glue on this edge to.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness, my kids are yelling, so either they're playing like Jurassic Park or they're mad at each other.	CHITCHAT
You never really know.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so without done I'm going to leave this open 'cause I'm I'm interested to see what's going to happen because honestly what I'm thinking is that these tabs will actually be better served attaching it to the grill.	O
Versus gluing this part on there.	O
So because I don't necessarily know how that's going to go yet.	O
I'm not going to do it right?	O
So this piece is supposed to go in here.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
It's not.	CHITCHAT
And it's probably because the thickness of the paper.	O
So I can do is I can trim it.	O
Just a hair.	O
And actually, these little tiny baby scissors are amazing.	O
But they are sharp.	O
Alright, so just just trimmed it a little bit just to see.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
It looks I'm getting close.	O
I need to cut.	CHITCHAT
I need to cut this guy.	O
Yeah, so I did not.	O
Put into consideration what type of paper or material I was using.	O
When we made the templates all right there we go now it's N and that is tight.	O
So yeah, normally you would want a glue on that, but I don't think it's going to come out.	O
That's really tight.	O
Alright sweet, so now I need to go ahead and kind of like what I did last time.	O
Trim the rest of this around.	O
Until there is like one facet touching and then from there.	O
Oh look, at their did come out after all, right?	O
But that's OK.	CHITCHAT
We're going to fold all these little tiny guys down.	O
Now, if I had to do this again, I would make this so much bigger.	O
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
So much bigger.	CHITCHAT
OK, and then I'm going to go ahead an like, twist it with my fingers like stretch it out.	O
Hey.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes got added to the circle.	O
Which is definitely not the way to do it.	O
Alright cool, so now what we're going to do is that we're going to glue.	O

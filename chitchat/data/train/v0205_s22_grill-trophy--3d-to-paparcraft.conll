This an if you guys remember this had a bit of a kind of like an inward cone shape.	O
So this is how it's going to look right.	O
But then we also have these guys that we need to binge.	O
Granted, I don't know if those are going to be.	O
I think there was actually might be.	O
Right, so I'm not gonna worry about that.	O
'cause I don't know if they're going to be mountain mountain folds or if those are going to be Valley fold.	O
So when you do not score.	O
You either fold it away from you for tordue.	O
And you fold it away from you.	O
The apex goes up.	O
Right of the fold and becomes a mountain.	O
Fold like that.	O
But if you fold it tordue the apex goes down and so ends up being at Valley Folds 'cause the Apex is down.	O
So so far you guys have seen really nothing but.	O
Mountain Mountain Falls, but I'm wondering if this next one is going to be a Valley fold now.	O
Normally what I can do is I can have it.	O
Show me a different color.	O
So I know like that is coming.	O
In the.	O
And unfold are right.	O
But I didn't do that.	O
I am getting blue kind of everywhere.	O
I do have this night Gama Racer though that does get rid of my.	O
Blue I can erase the glue, which is nice.	O
It's just called a glue eraser, so if you go to your local craft store.	O
Alright, so there you go.	CHITCHAT
So I have a bit of a doubled.	O
No, this is what I mean.	O
It looks just like a regular racer.	O
I mean, I think I even remember using this kind of eraser whenever I was in high school trying attempting math.	O
Mean math do not get along well, it's done.	CHITCHAT
Wow, something happened.	CHITCHAT
A piece that cut.	O
That looks like it wasn't supposed to be cut.	O
Oh, a lot of pieces got cut that weren't supposed to be kind.	O
Oh all the time I'm gonna have to redo that whole thing that sucks.	O
So all the all the score marks that I completely forgot to turn into score marks.	O
Of course, interpreted as cut marks.	O
And so that means.	CHITCHAT
Some of these pieces that weren't supposed to be cut.	O
They were supposed to be scores.	O
Initially our our scores, but the cool thing is, is that there's enough that works where I can still use this as a test sample just to see if like that would generally work.	O
Alright, so now that we have this.	O
So am I.	CHITCHAT
My scenes are back here so I kind of want my seems to like lineup.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
We have this in.	O
Nice.	CHITCHAT
I even like how because I pushed it in, there's a little bit of a did it, which is nice alright, and So what I'm going to do is, I'm quite literally going to put glue here.	O
And it is a lot.	O
Like probably just use my novel here to.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
I swear I can never make like one thing in one stream.	CHITCHAT
It just it just can't happen, right?	CHITCHAT
So you can see that this is to this is too small, so there definitely is an interim step and this is what this one is, right?	O
So we're going to go ahead and get that in there and so it looks like to me.	O
That this is definitely one of those where all I have to do is just glue this on top.	O
So those are definitely.	O
Rich folds or Valley folds like I was telling you guys about.	O
Where I need to bend them towards me instead of away?	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So there's obviously still a lot to do.	O
I'm not going to be able to get it all done today.	O
But the good news is that I still have until I think Friday or Saturday in order to make this happen.	O
So there's probably going to be some impromptu.	O
Let me get you guys over here.	CHITCHAT
There's probably going to be some impromptu.	CHITCHAT

So I want to fix that, uhm?	O
And we can fix that by just moving this shape down a little bit, not her ear, but her hair scarf.	O
Let's see what layer is that on.	O
I think some apron layer.	O
And just go like this.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
That's better.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
In the shape her here a little better here.	O
And I am going to grab this dark blackish color and I'm going to lower the opacity of her skin, let's see.	O
I did not to label that layer.	O
Of course I didn't.	O
Where did I put that?	CHITCHAT
There it is.	CHITCHAT
Let's lower the opacity of the space layer, and then we're going to go up to the outline layer.	O
Anne, just draw in her face.	O
I'm just going to do everything with this black color first just because it's faster and then actually I'm going to zoom in a little bit.	O
And then I will just lock the transparency of the layer an go back and change colors.	O
Question of the day.	O
What color is Cinderella's eyebrows?	O
Sender Ella.	CHITCHAT
The Cinderella he has.	O
She has dark eyebrows.	O
He does have Brown.	O
I was going to say I'm pretty sure she doesn't have blonde eyebrows.	O
She has dark Brown eyebrows.	O
Good to know.	CHITCHAT
OK, well I guess I will just go ahead and.	O
The more you know.	CHITCHAT
OK, we're And let's going to just go ahead and do this.	O
Do her nose and mouth in Rapid City.	O
Um, going to do this on Brown relief.	O
Oops, that is not a good shoot knows.	O
Just going to give her a big old bulbous nose.	O
It's so funny how the nose just completely changes the face right?	O
Like I could give her like a total like which hooknose then suddenly she's like a completely different person.	O
OK, so let's raise the opacity of her face.	O
And I am going to grab the skin tone, color and saturated and low of lower the lightness.	O
I'm going to go back to the outline layer and I'm going to use that color for her nose and hurt year and this little part probably, and then I think I might go and use this dark pink color for her list.	O
I think this color might be a little bit too dark.	O
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and then I need to add in her little cheeks.	O
So I'm going to use this pink color.	O
You draw a on a real canvas too.	O
I really like your style.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
No ever.	CHITCHAT
All of my artwork is digital.	CHITCHAT
So, so does she dye her hair?	CHITCHAT
That's a very good question.	CHITCHAT

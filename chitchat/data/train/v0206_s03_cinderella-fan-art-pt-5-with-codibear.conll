I mean, not always, uh.	CHITCHAT
Your eyebrows don't always necessarily match your hair color.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like how some beards are a different color than like head hair like some men will have a Brown hair and red beard, so it doesn't always match.	CHITCHAT
But it's a very good conspiracy theory come you're coming up with their Martin.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's go down to the base layer.	O
Let's lock the transparency.	O
An I'm using one of Kyle Websters watercolor brushes for the blush and I'm just going to kind of slowly add in some little blush ease.	O
Sometimes I like doing it like very UM, blended and then other times I like doing it like this where it's a very defined round circle.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think I like the look of that.	O
Yeah, I think I like that I might move her mouth over a little bit.	O
Change the position of your mouth.	O
Yeah, that looks good.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
See I might try something.	O
Let's take this pencil.	O
Uh, this is actually the brush that I use for sketching and I'm going to.	O
Try to make a shadow with with a kind of like a color pencil.	O
Sketchy to texture.	O
It might not work, but we are experimenting.	O
And it just looks like that's a little bit too dark.	O
Kind of just looks like she has a bit of a choker chain on.	O
I think I want to try to do that with.	O
Let's try it again on a different part of her.	O
Um wears her dress layer.	O
There it is.	CHITCHAT
Even says in my case, hair and beard are both a mix of white and Brown.	O
When I was younger, my beard was Brown, but I would have a random ginger bits.	O
Yeah, yeah, see exactly hey Sean, how are you doing save thank you.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate it saved.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's.	CHITCHAT
Anna.	O
Mixture, let's write maybe like across Hachi texture.	O
I don't know, just kind of.	O
Kind of trying to experiment here with.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Even if I like adding kind of like a colored pencil extra.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
I opened accidentally just opened Google help like 3 times by pressing the wrong key.	O
Then you shouldn't be so dark.	O
Do you guys think?	CHITCHAT
Don't know.	CHITCHAT
OK, welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm new to this.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely love your illustration.	CHITCHAT
Sorry if it sounds silly, but do you have live sessions regularly?	CHITCHAT
I've never used this website.	CHITCHAT
Also, what are you drawing with?	CHITCHAT
I use an Apple pencil acateno.	CHITCHAT
It's not as silly question at all.	CHITCHAT
I do, um, I do live stream on be hands three times a week and you can also find other artists live streaming on.	CHITCHAT
Be hands as well.	CHITCHAT
It is a pretty new thing to be Hans.	CHITCHAT
It's still in beta and it's closed live streaming so there's only like a handful of us that are streaming on be hands.	CHITCHAT
Currently we've been streaming for a few months now.	CHITCHAT
And also usually regularly on a daily basis throughout the day.	CHITCHAT
Adobe has an official live stream called Adobe live where like the actual Adobe employees like the evangelists will do like master classes on all of the different programs and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT

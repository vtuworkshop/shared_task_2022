And actually, if I'm not missing anymore, I think I might draw one there anyway.	O
Because it kind of looks like there's this like a big space there.	O
Yeah, there wasn't the sketch.	O
There wasn't a bubble there in this sketch.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think I'll draw one ends.	O
Right there.	CHITCHAT
You're going to post it on Instagram to start following it all.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much, Kate.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I will post it.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, probably not today, but I usually on my Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I like to do one illustration without a background and one illustration with the background and I like to alternate that because it just looks really kind of even on my feed, so it'll probably be a few days until after I post this because I gotta post something else first.	O
Uhm, but yeah.	O
OK, let me draw my.	O
Signature.	O
Whoops, new.	CHITCHAT
Wouldn't wanna do that.	CHITCHAT

I always have to make sure that I turn off.	O
The sketch layer before I post.	O
Sometimes I forget to do that and then I look at the post on.	O
On line, yeah, I had it turned on.	O
I look at the post online I was like Oh man, you could see the sketch Internet.	O
Dang it.	CHITCHAT
OK, now we should save one last time and let's see we got about 12 minutes left in the stream.	O
I'm going to go to the bathroom really quick and then maybe after that we will just for like the last few minutes will work on one of the vegetable illustrations for the.	O
Um alphabet project.	O
You know what you guys look at this whole right here?	O
What is this whole?	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
It's like a big empty space.	O
Between the tile in the.	O
Killer.	O
What's the weather out there?	CHITCHAT
If you're wondering about this thunderstorm in the background, that's actually just a YouTube video just for background noise, but the weather here is very humid and not rainy.	CHITCHAT
What about the other poll, Hillary?	CHITCHAT
Actually, this one has kind of a gap too.	O
He wrote Voodoo Val on your creatures surfboard and the design of- yes I did.	O
OK, that looks better and then this part.	O

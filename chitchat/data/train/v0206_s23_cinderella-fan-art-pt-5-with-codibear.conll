So for those of you that are new here a while back I had kind of started a long term project where I.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm doing an alphabet project, uhm where each alphabet letter is based off of an heirloom vegetable.	O
And these are the ones that I've finished so far.	O
And like all the letters are made out of logs.	O
And this is kind of just a project that I go back to every once in awhile, when, uhm.	O
Oh, that's right.	CHITCHAT
I avoided see because I didn't really like how I drew it and I want to redo it.	O
Just a project that I go go back to when we aren't really working on anything else currently.	O
Uhm, I guess dragon fruits done too, actually.	O
Let's save this.	O
Of the PNG.	O
An open I don't believe I've started.	O
Dragon fruit DEVO eggplant.	O
So I'm just going to go ahead and actually we probably won't have too much time to do anything.	O
'cause I only have like.	O
Few minutes left but.	CHITCHAT
Let's make a new layer.	O
I can at least draw over this.	O
So yeah, originally I had started doing the project with these fonts, but I felt like it wasn't really, uhm.	O
Me.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
It was a little bit too.	CHITCHAT
It was a little bit too digitally.	O
I felt, um, an it didn't really feel like my branding, so I wanted to.	O
Redraw everything.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The the text I'm drawing by hand with my own handwriting.	O
Actually drawing writing everything instead of using a font is something that I'm doing throughout all of my artwork now.	O
Um, because again I feel like it's just.	O
It's a little bit more me and it makes.	O
My stuff a little bit more unique because nobody can copy my handwriting.	O
And it also just kind of gives us a little bit more of a rustic appeal.	O
My stuff.	CHITCHAT
So I've kind of stopped using fonts and just started handwriting everything.	O
All right, well, I guess we didn't really have.	O
We didn't really have enough time to even really start working on this badly, but I'm going to have to head out you guys.	O
Thank you so much for hanging out with me today.	O
Um, we finally finished Cinderella even after losing 2 hours of work.	O
Probably could have finished it last St last stream if that hadn't happened, but that's OK if we did finish it.	O
So woo yay, uhm?	CHITCHAT
If.	CHITCHAT
I really don't know what I'm going to be doing for my next uhm.	CHITCHAT
Streams yet, but I will be back streaming on Monday.	CHITCHAT
Like always, I think I'm probably going to stream Monday, Wednesday, Friday next week, um.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, usually I'm on at around 8:00 AM CST and that would be 6:00 AM PSG and otherwise.	CHITCHAT
You can usually catch me up a little bit later in the day modding for Adobe live.	CHITCHAT
There we live will be back next week.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I hope you guys have a good weekend.	CHITCHAT
I will see you then bye.	CHITCHAT

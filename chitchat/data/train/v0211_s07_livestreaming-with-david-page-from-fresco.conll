Calling it a series, I'll see only a few states have started doing that, you know?	CHITCHAT
And I guess that's.	CHITCHAT
Why is a little cheaper 'cause you can do like I'm I'm starting to seriously.	CHITCHAT
It's like you designate it.	CHITCHAT
It's still more expensive than just one else.	CHITCHAT
As far as what I looked at, the prices again, uh or deeper, I didn't.	CHITCHAT
Just full.	CHITCHAT
Like Um?	CHITCHAT
My basically like sometimes when I'm talking to someone who knows so much more about this and it feels like I'm talking like.	CHITCHAT
Shrug passionate about a particular coding language, so I'll take your word for it like how?	CHITCHAT
Sure, are you like about all this?	CHITCHAT
'cause the language on line is very.	CHITCHAT
My confusing and very confusing the sense that like.	CHITCHAT
People are also sceptical like like they say, a lot of what you're saying, so I know you're you're right.	CHITCHAT
Bye.	CHITCHAT
Why would it's trying to be is like exactly like you see what I think it is right.	CHITCHAT
Like you see how from my perspective.	CHITCHAT
Like I think it's like this ideal scenario.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, where, uh, basically every project has an LCD words grouped in there and people own equity in that directly.	CHITCHAT
Thing is, you we?	CHITCHAT
We can still do that even under one.	CHITCHAT
It's just like.	CHITCHAT
An internal mapping rather than a legally separate mapping.	CHITCHAT
If that.	CHITCHAT
You know if we want to do like that, 'cause like if there are serious houses, every group has their own bank account and file separate taxes and all that and all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
So that's like why it's basically just multiple elsies nested, except that it's defined as series.	CHITCHAT
So it's like up front.	CHITCHAT
You know you're going to have multiple of them.	CHITCHAT
You do the same.	CHITCHAT
Thing with one else and you just have an internal structure, one bank account, but you know it's like you bring someone.	CHITCHAT
OK, well you have 50% of this project.	CHITCHAT
Here is the cost center.	CHITCHAT
Here's a profit center you just like tracking that way in the same thing that this is like.	CHITCHAT
This makes it easier.	CHITCHAT
'cause like I said, try to differentiate.	CHITCHAT
It's like we could do all this stuff internally and we kind of are like not to like the degree of.	CHITCHAT
I know what percentage is one of us has of their projects, but in our accounting tool we are separating revenues and expenses by category like by digital marketing inspired reality group real and be a threat like these are the categories we would have as separate series LLC's, right?	CHITCHAT
So that's already tracking it just like what the series does any sort of else when you separate out like that does is?	CHITCHAT
Outside looking in, they can, uh, it's like more blatant to know yeah, like this is.	CHITCHAT
What you know this is what's best one here is making because it's going to a separate bank account and it has a separate EN and you know, like the reason you separate.	CHITCHAT
You make an LCD begin with is like separate legal responsibility.	CHITCHAT
All that stuff, and that's that's not so much as you know.	CHITCHAT
I we don't really need all that like we have one and it's like I guess sure it's like if if BOH get sued then it's not going to affect group.	CHITCHAT
Well that's nice.	CHITCHAT
I don't think that that's like a high risk.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't like really.	CHITCHAT
I don't think there's a party part part of it is definitely protecting.	CHITCHAT
And my part of it is like I thought like maybe we could segment out like the.	CHITCHAT
Home.	CHITCHAT
Like the cyber props, equity and protect ourselves from that angle and just like be like OK, these people worked on this.	CHITCHAT
This will work on this.	CHITCHAT
Is my Apple ID vote and be like they'll say that's fair and that would be the end of that kind of confusion.	CHITCHAT
I'm fairly mostly tools, did not work on group real equity.	CHITCHAT
Is in a Corporation, though I'm not sure if that transfer is like, hey, let's keep the same proportion and make an LLC.	CHITCHAT
Is that what you're saying?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, basically that you keep the same proportion of.	CHITCHAT
Like like the management company being saggy products Inc.	CHITCHAT
Owns the series LLC portion of cyber props and flights.	CHITCHAT
OK, that is their portion and then what I really like about it is you know we're dealing in this business where like Mechanics Mobile.	CHITCHAT
Many people who are bringing up their ideas.	CHITCHAT
This offers the structure or we could like engage them.	CHITCHAT
An offer them business services, all packaged up and all that in exchange for some equity in their company.	CHITCHAT

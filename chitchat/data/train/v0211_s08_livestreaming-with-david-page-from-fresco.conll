We deliver Warren Buffett type strategy where we give them the controlling share and we hold on to like 30% of it.	CHITCHAT
We do the part where we kind of the startup accelerator program where we take them all the way to the.	CHITCHAT
The finish line and we own equity in their company moving forward.	CHITCHAT
And we do like a hybrid of cash equity mix.	CHITCHAT
Now I like that a lot more because like.	CHITCHAT
Somebody do fail and we had the situation mechanics mobile, but we basically crippled him.	CHITCHAT
Financially moving forward and that kind of sucks, so creating this like equity cash hybrid models.	CHITCHAT
Where we have like these different.	CHITCHAT
Endeavors.	CHITCHAT
I thought the series I will see my surge.	CHITCHAT
As a perfect structure for that, uh, that otherwise wouldn't would be some separately negotiated thing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's more.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to.	CHITCHAT
Got my head around back in the direction go right now because I feel like that accelerator thing is more down the line.	CHITCHAT
Like immediately we would cook something else so that's why I'm like wait OK is that excellerator type thing the way that we're going to go?	CHITCHAT
Or is E Commerce going to take off and we're just going to start doing our own E Commerce sites?	CHITCHAT
And then would we even need something like that?	CHITCHAT
Would I like about it?	CHITCHAT
Is that it?	CHITCHAT
OK, matches what we've been doing in that people.	CHITCHAT
People come and go, especially developments, so developers want to participate in this project.	CHITCHAT
But then they want to skip, skip to the like the third project.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, skipped over the group project.	CHITCHAT
OK, that's fine.	CHITCHAT
That's how you set up structures like, but would you like to engage is on this other project that we're doing, and it creates the situation.	CHITCHAT
But not only that, we own the parent company like like, we all get the same version like you pay the company that portion but say.	CHITCHAT
Leah wants to do this side project and she kind of gets a small team of people together and she's leading.	CHITCHAT
You have 70% ownership of that project.	CHITCHAT
You still in the company is 30%, so your again getting paid like your again getting.	CHITCHAT
My conversation from the company perspective, but you also are now the leading person on that.	CHITCHAT
With all access site like the resources of interest part I just like.	CHITCHAT
The thing is, so you're saying.	CHITCHAT
It also allows us to.	CHITCHAT
Fairly compensated people and also gives everyone the opportunity like the captaincy of their own project type thing while still being part of it.	CHITCHAT
And even if people don't come on in a full time capacity like a charade.	CHITCHAT
Like he could basically kids need to operate with us.	CHITCHAT
Down the line on various projects, perhaps even leading his own project wonder.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And how it would work?	CHITCHAT
Or Yeah, but so.	CHITCHAT
You said that gives us the flexibility that we want, and that's true, but that is a.	CHITCHAT
Uh, How do I put this?	CHITCHAT
So you say you say we're starting a new project.	CHITCHAT
You have to give 100% of that equity.	CHITCHAT
There's no like.	CHITCHAT
I guess you could have most of it.	CHITCHAT
Owned by the interest fire parents, but then which we own.	CHITCHAT
But this is like I don't know, so whatever.	CHITCHAT
Later, well, no, you wouldn't use.	CHITCHAT
It would have to be.	CHITCHAT
You would restructure it.	CHITCHAT
So like you know, for group real for example, you have to put numbers to it like what percentage do individuals own and what percentage does the parent company own.	CHITCHAT
And then like if you want to bring in other people.	CHITCHAT
So one of the things I see that you like about it is that like oh we could give video editors when we scale up we can give them equity in the group real instead.	CHITCHAT
It's like, OK yeah, then we could and but you'd have to restructure it every time you add a person.	CHITCHAT
To cut some offering you you both right like say 33%, three percent, 30% company, whatever right it's another person comes in there, uh?	CHITCHAT
Full time video editor.	CHITCHAT
Some things affect you.	CHITCHAT
Change it, you legally change it.	CHITCHAT
You can't just you know.	CHITCHAT
And it's like that's the point of them.	CHITCHAT
That's why they're using real estate markets.	CHITCHAT
Like once you buy it like you just run it for years.	CHITCHAT
If you want like A.	CHITCHAT
It is a structure that can do whatever it wants, but like it's not like it hardens like brick, not like clay.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe not so much a brick.	CHITCHAT
We don't mean it's not like multiple like right now we have money going out.	CHITCHAT

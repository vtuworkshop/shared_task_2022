We can spend it, people we can pay each other, whatever.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't matter.	CHITCHAT
We have 100 autonomy.	CHITCHAT
Basically if you do this structure, yeah, it is nice to have structure to set up everything and everyone can see like exactly what's going on, but you know you have less float 'cause every.	CHITCHAT
Venture every business, venture his own bank account.	CHITCHAT
It would be a lot more of a cash flow.	CHITCHAT
Would be a lot harder for cash flows, right?	CHITCHAT
Like 'cause you can't.	CHITCHAT
You can't pay.	CHITCHAT
You can't take Fleshman money and pay for the group rehosting even know group is not making money yet because like that's his own thing is running as a business.	CHITCHAT
You know you have to do this thing where you loan it money and then eventually makes anything give it back.	CHITCHAT
That's documented, those are bank transactions.	CHITCHAT
Very hot, it's just like well.	CHITCHAT
PC in like in terms of you talk about like how there's no, but you have to allocate all of the.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's out.	CHITCHAT
Change the equity out I'm on.	CHITCHAT
Driver problems like we were constantly fluctuating it.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I saw that speak working can own multiple.	CHITCHAT
Project products within a.	CHITCHAT
No see I Series LLC so be on three of the product within the series that will see and were able to fluctuate the equity on the secret.	CHITCHAT
Might actually that the fluctuation the that you needed.	CHITCHAT
I mean it definitely started to get paired.	CHITCHAT
Prompted by that point, but.	CHITCHAT
Like if in situations were just like in the beginning, this is your project.	CHITCHAT
Like it's something like a best one, headers type endeavour.	CHITCHAT
There's not going to be a whole lot of fluctuation down the line and.	CHITCHAT
Someone who's wants to lead it.	CHITCHAT
Is incentivized to do so which is what I like the most about.	CHITCHAT
It is because it.	CHITCHAT
So let me know if you hear about a point.	CHITCHAT
Never gonna get their their section.	CHITCHAT
And have.	CHITCHAT
I dared do.	CHITCHAT
Credit for it almost never matches up.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Equity now gives.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I agree that we need a fatimas like growing or shrinking.	CHITCHAT
It's better we are lacking a good structure of like why does for tat right?	CHITCHAT
Like that and that the group mentality.	CHITCHAT
Uh, is doesn't scale well, right?	CHITCHAT
Like that's why people in successful companies.	CHITCHAT
They pay salaries like you know what you're getting your getting that we're paying.	CHITCHAT
You were going to somebody else, but like, that's the structure.	CHITCHAT
That way we can actually plan on things.	CHITCHAT
We know what money was allocated for it.	CHITCHAT
Like we don't have that.	CHITCHAT
It's just like when we have.	CHITCHAT
Actually, we don't technically have.	CHITCHAT
Really wanted by these initial paychecks to be going through an entity that isn't either completely allocated out like through cider drops.	CHITCHAT
And disproportionate manner to the point.	CHITCHAT
We had to kind of change that up later.	CHITCHAT
What if we like just leave interest fire cider process where it is right now and start this series, LLC.	CHITCHAT
Um thing or?	CHITCHAT
Now that's one problem.	CHITCHAT
Hand like 20%.	CHITCHAT
It's I think it's $800 compared to $500.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and it would be.	CHITCHAT
We would just have a very basic one to start if you think it's something we could grow into and figure it out.	CHITCHAT
To me it's worth potentially the extra 300 than the.	CHITCHAT
The no equity.	CHITCHAT
Allocation method basic else really.	CHITCHAT
Would put his hand too.	CHITCHAT
I agree that there should be there, um, holding people accountable or like ownership of or however you want to describe it, like a section is good.	CHITCHAT
'cause then you can feel like the work you do actually is more obvious or blatant to come right back like you see how it works instead of just like everyone working for the Golden Spiral and then that that successful and then it rains down.	CHITCHAT
It's more like.	CHITCHAT
This part, this part of the garden, is doing well and like, so that's where I read my heart from.	CHITCHAT
I get that it definitely should be something to better.	CHITCHAT
Track and be able to better understand like where money can go.	CHITCHAT
You know something is profitable.	CHITCHAT
So I'm definitely with you is series else the right choice.	CHITCHAT
I think it is a good one.	CHITCHAT
And so I wanted to make a point, you're saying?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, we were changing the equity with the C Corp all the time.	CHITCHAT
We did it on paper.	CHITCHAT
We it takes just as much to restructure equity in a sequence that does else.	CHITCHAT
It just like we change that Excel sheet all the time.	CHITCHAT
We only really like.	CHITCHAT

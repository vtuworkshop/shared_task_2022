We didn't legal.	CHITCHAT
I guess that's just in the spreadsheet.	CHITCHAT
A lot of it like.	CHITCHAT
There is only a few times.	CHITCHAT
Kids change equity.	CHITCHAT
At all from, you can't exchange shares in OC.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, then I'll come shares with same idea though you own because it's because you don't sell them because it's not really a share.	CHITCHAT
It's just I mean because it will never be like something on the market even as a private company C Corps are shares, because theoretically go public, but in else it's just like you own.	CHITCHAT
Uh, proportion and that share is a good way to talk about it, 'cause it's like they'll say Oh, there's 10 shares I own for you on 4140.	CHITCHAT
Nope, you actually can only own two like this, they just that's a proportion to allocate.	CHITCHAT
You know, it doesn't matter like you're giving out something.	CHITCHAT
Sure, Internet will tell you it's not shares, but you don't have to really think of it as any different.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
It makes sense and I definitely starting to get a better understanding of it.	CHITCHAT
For my question would be if tomorrow I'm registering an LLC.	CHITCHAT
I you or I mean listen later and or you as agents of it in my listing as a Series LLC basic one start.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
800 and or am I doing a normal LLC in boxing this into A?	CHITCHAT
Or am I doing the $30 in converting Indiana 1 to a DBA, which I don't want to do because I really do want?	CHITCHAT
And you could definitely correctly on this.	CHITCHAT
The DBA doesn't necessarily put it in Texas as much as authorizes us to do business in Texas, and we have to have the bank account.	CHITCHAT
Here in Texas anyway, and in Indiana and then we have to worry about taxes in those.	CHITCHAT
States.	CHITCHAT
I just thought it might be easier just to deal with taxes Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, dva is just for the name.	CHITCHAT
I think they call it.	CHITCHAT
Something else here, but.	CHITCHAT
That was the format, so it was like.	CHITCHAT
And it's called.	CHITCHAT
Keep on my notebook, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
It is.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, anyway, I'll named resource change or something, right?	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Will you do you?	CHITCHAT
I will talk more about it.	CHITCHAT
I think I got my yeah 20% learned.	CHITCHAT
A little bit more slowly and surely about.	CHITCHAT
The limitations.	CHITCHAT
Also.	CHITCHAT
The part about.	CHITCHAT
Different state lines.	CHITCHAT
We didn't cover the bad because this isn't a nasty in multiple states.	CHITCHAT
There's like 9 states that recognize it.	CHITCHAT
All the other 42 or 50 or whatever.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
They would just be an LLC anyway.	CHITCHAT
At the at the top level.	CHITCHAT
It's like an annual fee of based on a number of serious is we have.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's really now and.	CHITCHAT
I have to do my question is.	CHITCHAT
Try a Series LLC tomorrow I would say.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think we should look into it more.	CHITCHAT
I agree, I'm just.	CHITCHAT
I was kind of wondering like that.	CHITCHAT
That's the question I'm asking not to.	CHITCHAT
'cause there is also like.	CHITCHAT
Conversions and other stuff like that, but I don't even compare anything.	CHITCHAT
If we can make it, we can later tack this on cyber Broadcom 'cause I.	CHITCHAT
Don't do it for the sake of those people who own equity, entire crops, but I would like to.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to like.	CHITCHAT
Starting else, which I don't think.	CHITCHAT
Is fairly can own a.	CHITCHAT
So I don't think.	CHITCHAT
I don't think a speaker can own an LLC.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I think you can.	CHITCHAT
I I they made it sound like it was a unique situation so I could be wrong, but there like a C Corp in this scenario can also be a managing company that owns several series of a Series LLC, but I don't think.	CHITCHAT
Pork is treated as an individual, so it can own property and steak analysis and can be sued and things like that.	CHITCHAT
Gotcha.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, cool well.	CHITCHAT

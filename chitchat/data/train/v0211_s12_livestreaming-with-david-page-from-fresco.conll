They choose them.	O
You wouldn't actually have a Crown on it, you know.	O
It just sounds better to me then 'cause we're going with the circus carnival flight fun theme.	O
And I'm going to make a little story line on it was like 'cause it's special summer release.	O
And so I want to integrate that into the door line of like summer.	O
You have carnivals and festivals.	O
Maybe you can't go out this year but like this.	O
This, you know, indoor.	O
A Carnival and bring the car and stuff like that, right?	O
'cause it's limited addition, some release how they're saying it.	O
And now we were really, really sit next year or whatever.	O
In the winter we can change it a little bit, not, you know, not that we have to, but just like less stress on it being summer carnival 'cause they made the point to say.	O
Yeah, exactly.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I love it.	CHITCHAT
It's a great body.	CHITCHAT
The one thing I was going to ask you, we, uh, uh, if you know because Adobe has some.	O
Some stuff that would be cool, but I don't know.	O
Like I didn't have access to it, but I don't know if you do where you got like the balloons is a.	O
To what?	CHITCHAT
Basically a marquee?	O
This.	CHITCHAT
I think this is using my.	CHITCHAT
Yeah OK, there we go.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Like stuff like this I want and I want to show.	O
Uh, In addition to the thing you made.	O
Nearest is done at first.	O
Like My inspiration is kind of.	O
This like this.	O
Um, and kind of like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know like that.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
These kind of.	O
And I'm just trying to make something similar to like a marquee, and there's Adobe stock, which I don't have, like a paid thing for Adobe.	O
Is that something you do I don't know anything about this.	O
I just.	CHITCHAT
Adobe stock and things like a page terrorist like you still like.	O
It's like shutter stock still greatly.	O
Oh yeah, yeah so.	CHITCHAT
But we can find free one I'm sure, yeah.	CHITCHAT
OK cool, so do we have?	CHITCHAT
We haven't had any credits inside so we also have credit.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we can just little.	CHITCHAT
I do it all the time.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool OK.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I was thinking like this.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So it's like a.	CHITCHAT
Sign instead of you guys.	CHITCHAT
So see the screen right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, so this is what I made.	O
It obviously isn't.	O
It wouldn't stay, it's just like the vision of trying to say like these things.	O
That look nice, except you know, I kind of like that.	O
Do you want me to?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I hope I can basically just help you find 1 and then do you want to mess around with it or do you want me to mess around?	O
Said I can.	CHITCHAT
Yeah if you can find it I think places in.	O
If you could have.	O
Pixel perfect enough after.	O
We just like the elements.	O
I mean it's going printed on on his on his blinks so.	O
As definitely kind of A.	O
It would be nice to have the the professional, such as the last second there like a.	O
There is no.	CHITCHAT
I've never created something that you were happy with and you want to bring something like David and I've been going back and forth so I just don't know.	O
Like next step, if you wanted to do it next or actually wanted me to do it next.	O
I mean, I'm definitely I can definitely take a look at the end.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, so I think he wanted to.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you are wanting to like mess it on your own and then.	O
Yeah I can.	CHITCHAT
Or I can message her first cousin.	CHITCHAT
Yes, see over the years from be thinking I did good just now.	CHITCHAT

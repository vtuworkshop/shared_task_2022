If there's anything.	CHITCHAT
You can find a where would I look?	CHITCHAT
I can help do that too, 'cause I'm just waiting on this dress tonight.	CHITCHAT
So the free ones would be.	CHITCHAT
Freepink.com is a good one.	CHITCHAT
Then, uh.	CHITCHAT
Takes a day is a good one.	CHITCHAT
What the hell?	CHITCHAT
Great.	CHITCHAT

Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
I thought pop up in like where you kind of stuff you download here.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
This looks more.	CHITCHAT
I have to go back to that one out later, we'll see.	CHITCHAT
And what's the other one, he said pixel?	CHITCHAT
IXABAY Assam.	CHITCHAT
And then I also have credits on Shutterstock approved.	CHITCHAT
I mean I can use.	CHITCHAT
You want so if you can't find me on there.	CHITCHAT
He's going to shutterstock.com And these are sponsored.	CHITCHAT
So exactly so those ones are just at like.	CHITCHAT
They ought to make sure that, like sometimes you have to filter out by one.	CHITCHAT
OK, sweet.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
All of them are like factors, be hugely download them as Jpegs too.	CHITCHAT
Is a vector?	CHITCHAT
Is it just for some reason?	CHITCHAT
OK, it does.	CHITCHAT
It was just the clip ones.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know to be honest.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm so fresco.	CHITCHAT
Adobe frescoed supports vectors.	CHITCHAT
Um procreate does.	CHITCHAT
And so I downloaded I bought procreate.	CHITCHAT
But I can import the.	CHITCHAT
I can import the.	CHITCHAT
Photo shop in, to procreate, and then separate it out and then re import it into a fresco and then do it from there.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why fresco doesn't accept 'cause it has both pixeleen vector when you like the options when you're.	CHITCHAT
Creating, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't really understand it like this is pixel and this is live and this is vector but.	CHITCHAT
Something on the radio.	CHITCHAT
Almost all the features you need, yeah, exactly.	CHITCHAT
Awesome well.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm going to different so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I'm free pick up there's.	CHITCHAT
I think they're all.	CHITCHAT
Most of them are free but then OK, so there's like a little Crown in the top left corner of the ones in our previous like the one.	CHITCHAT
Those are all free.	CHITCHAT
Oh nice, this is perfect.	CHITCHAT
Ah, OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I love outside.	CHITCHAT
These are like the ones that come up when I search for it, so this is what I was looking at like Google images anyway.	CHITCHAT
Right so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I wanted to involve the bulbs somehow because one of the things I need to change this make enough sense to you, but then I'll let you go, but they couldn't tell the difference between setup mode in play mode.	O
And so I'm going to have like yellow and white.	O
Circles basically spinning around the blinks in when you're in in set up mode and that would be like a tie into the light bulbs at like you know blink around these Marquez at carnivals and festivals will not.	O
So I'll try then.	O
More battle balloon games to take a story behind?	O
Yeah that yeah, it's kind of going like battle balloons, maybe isn't even the most active.	O
Whatever, it's a carnival game I think now, but I still think it makes sense to call about it once we will keep that right, yeah?	O

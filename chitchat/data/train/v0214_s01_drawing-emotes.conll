It's super good plan.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for listening.	CHITCHAT
Also, I got some cheesy poofs in my teeth, so it's great it's going real good for me personally right now.	CHITCHAT
Good, I was going to put the camera on today but then.	CHITCHAT
It was 5:30.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how that happened, but here we are.	CHITCHAT
Now it's catching some other art and time got away from Maine.	CHITCHAT
Mostly 'cause I've been very distracted today.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, how are you?	CHITCHAT
What you got going on?	CHITCHAT
What you doing objective?	O

Why am I like this?	O
Why do you let me do it this way?	O
No.	CHITCHAT
You do me.	O
And decided to do a :-( Instead of this is the previous one that I sketched out and had a little open mouths and was like this.	O
But this one looks like it's sniffing and I like that more.	O

Let me know if that happens eggs.	CHITCHAT
Keep me posted.	CHITCHAT
If you were a in the avatar universe, what kind would you be?	O
I'll be a waterbender.	O
I took Acquisita, maybe an airbender, but I don't believe that heisser terrifying, not a fan.	O
The idea of it is cool, but.	O
Being up there in the air and stuff and I don't know if I want that.	O
Not a fan.	CHITCHAT

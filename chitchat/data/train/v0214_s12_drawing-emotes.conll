Normally I could go along with movies early on that guy or it's like you know some people like I don't understand what's going on.	CHITCHAT
It's like I can kind of piece it together and I can pay attention, but that was like what what?	CHITCHAT
What?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I was trying not to laugh.	CHITCHAT
At some of those parts.	CHITCHAT
Do not lean over here.	CHITCHAT
At the beginning of the movie I was like is it just me or is this going by like really fast?	CHITCHAT
I don't think there was this English.	CHITCHAT
I mean, that was like more than a single shot that was more than maybe 3 seconds.	CHITCHAT
That's the next thing you know, captain and Captain America is like what?	CHITCHAT
Woah, Woah.	CHITCHAT
Just make everybody a clue and have it all be a play.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, well, just come in.	CHITCHAT
It's just like it's like that.	CHITCHAT
It's like that episode of Avatar where they go see the avatar plate, you know, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Baby are wakes up and it was all a poop in his diaper.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you know what?	CHITCHAT
That's what I'm looking forward too.	CHITCHAT
Though it is made the Learning Season 2.	CHITCHAT
You know my gosh, that's good.	CHITCHAT
Show solid and I guess it sounds like.	CHITCHAT
This is that.	CHITCHAT
Veterans like for the The Obi Wan.	CHITCHAT
Show they gonna do still use the same tech for filming it.	CHITCHAT
Where is the giant lady screens around and they generate everything around it.	CHITCHAT
Based on where the camera position is.	CHITCHAT
Which is why it looks real 'cause it is real.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much perspective is perfect.	CHITCHAT
Alien planet, they went to him.	CHITCHAT
Meaning and reflecting everything works perfectly off about the actors and all the physical stuff they have there.	CHITCHAT
'cause the light is like actually there.	CHITCHAT
It's actually very impressive tech.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it runs basically the mandalorian runs on the Unreal Engine, which is pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
It's an unreal technology.	CHITCHAT
That one, I think that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty dope.	CHITCHAT
I'll show you a video on it at some point.	CHITCHAT
It's very cool.	CHITCHAT
What was the thing with the uh awards or something like Babe didn't?	CHITCHAT
I think they can nominate.	CHITCHAT
Is it proper Pasco?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, because he faces in their order was.	CHITCHAT
At one point but the.	CHITCHAT
Here's a voice, but he wasn't physically unset for a lot of the filming.	CHITCHAT
It was a body double well that yeah, it's a different actor, not body double, but another actor.	CHITCHAT
For some reason I had it in my head that it was him.	CHITCHAT
Like they could have had a body double, but it was not heard something I think for like one or two.	CHITCHAT
The episodes, like in its entire T he wasn't, it was someone else.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Problems playing me for a fool.	CHITCHAT
She is that his name in Alaska.	CHITCHAT
Is that right?	CHITCHAT
Pedro She's.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
I struggle with peoples names.	CHITCHAT
A lot.	CHITCHAT
One of those.	CHITCHAT
See, you hiccups.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
You heck write-off.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I'm just really bad news.	CHITCHAT
I only take away is I'm glad you don't have siblings benefits of being the remains of drag races where Y could you get crazy awesome force powers?	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I think I missed some of that.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it was a clone.	CHITCHAT
I don't even want to smell it.	CHITCHAT
They like this email icon staring out evil grid.	CHITCHAT
I'm eventually gonna forget that entire last movie though, and I'm very happy about it.	CHITCHAT

Adam.	CHITCHAT
That was probably going to be in T2.	O
I'm struggling because I made a bunch of extra faces.	O
So the the Earth Lady Ones.	O
I have one 234 of those.	O
Close one somewhere else, maybe I'll add another work.	O
Anyone with these five?	CHITCHAT
What do you mean to put those in T3?	O
If you could send me a screenshot of what you're talking about.	O
'cause I'm curious.	CHITCHAT
How do we make it more panicked?	O
But I'm sometimes.	O
'cause I know that I know the vibe.	O
Maybe more like a grimace.	O
My God.	CHITCHAT
Or something?	CHITCHAT
And that's that's what I gotta figure out though.	O
What to put where?	CHITCHAT
Which ones to put in wet places for the emotes?	O
'cause I want to fill all the slots.	O
But I feel bad because not everybody is going to be able to use the things.	O
Alright, let's resize this.	O
Trying to have it fixed the borders.	O
But Number.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
There's a boofer out there.	CHITCHAT
Say.	CHITCHAT
There we go, that is besides, we're doing.	O
Now I'm curious though.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's a good one.	CHITCHAT
I like that one a lot and I like that it's a snowman.	O
So maybe just more sweat drops as the answer instead of one big one.	O
A bunch of little ones.	O
And instead of looking back just to.	O
Looking down sort of thing.	O
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Just like a sort of expression instead.	O
After every workout in this sketch, and probably turn the face down instead of looking at upwards or downwards.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
More room on the skin for some swift.	O
But it definitely workable, something we could.	O
Do you?	CHITCHAT
Pressure.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna flip this and see if it looks good.	O
You know wow.	CHITCHAT
It's not terrible, but it's it needs some need some warping.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
That's why we flip our images.	O
Windows.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I will Google it.	CHITCHAT
Very batali awning.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure why it's happening.	CHITCHAT
Not that tired.	CHITCHAT
Little tired though.	CHITCHAT
But not that tired.	CHITCHAT
We have about an hour left of the stream.	CHITCHAT
We can definitely get this one done.	CHITCHAT
At the very least, this mode then.	CHITCHAT

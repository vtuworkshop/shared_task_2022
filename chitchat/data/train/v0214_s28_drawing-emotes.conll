Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
He's making mean faces at me.	CHITCHAT
Go get me a beer.	CHITCHAT
Z.	CHITCHAT
He's being really mean to me.	CHITCHAT
I think we'll do.	CHITCHAT
Red eyes cheap me add.	O
Only add.	O
Orange even read when I was going for something a little more orangey glasses too.	O
Man, man I don't know.	O
Memo ODI know this super dramatic but also could look very not good.	O
I'm going to try a different color for the whites of the eyes.	O
I'm going to try orange and then I'm going to try black and we will see if any of them look good this.	O
Boogie Ooh, that is like straight up evil.	O
I like it, but it's not really the vibe we're going for.	O
Will stick with.	CHITCHAT
Wait, I guess.	CHITCHAT
Trying to make this curve a little nicer.	O
Do you ever feel guilty about things?	CHITCHAT
Send Like you didn't, you didn't do anything wrong.	CHITCHAT
But you still feel bad about it.	CHITCHAT
And it just pops up out of nowhere.	CHITCHAT
Like right now I just felt super guilty about about ditching when we had ordered food at a place.	CHITCHAT
But the places in the airport and we're going to miss our flight and we had ordered fat like 45 minutes to an hour ago with no sign of our waiter like they never checked upon us or anything.	CHITCHAT
And we had a flight.	CHITCHAT
And so we just.	CHITCHAT
We just had that we had to leave.	CHITCHAT
You can find the waiver anywhere and I feel bad about it.	CHITCHAT
What else are we supposed to do you know?	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
I've done retail stuff before.	CHITCHAT
I've done customer service stuff before.	CHITCHAT
It sucks.	CHITCHAT
It's not fun.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't waiters fault at all, you know.	CHITCHAT
But the plane?	O
And then I'm gonna do it straight, darker color.	O
I'm gonna see how this compares to the evil IMO.	O
That we just did 'cause they don't want it to be the exact same.	O
Color Wise.	O
I don't think it is I think good.	O
This ones :-( this one :) completely different.	O
Totally different.	O
Yeah, I think we.	CHITCHAT
I think we need the red above the forehead.	O
For sure.	CHITCHAT
And then we'll do the inside her part in that one.	O

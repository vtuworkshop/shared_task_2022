I'm pretty happy with it.	O
It definitely fits the vibe a bit more.	O
That one there.	O
Initially I was filling in the frame, so over barrows.	O
Black behind them, but I'm not too worried about that anymore.	O
Didn't really change much of anything.	O
Teeny tiny details.	O
Didn't really end up making a difference.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Boo.	CHITCHAT
And I think in that top.	O
Right, a little bit.	O
The eyelashes are on top of the phrase.	O
Don't worry that it.	O
It's all in service of the the space and facial expression taking precedence over.	O
Will details snippet.	O
You Merge sat down.	O
And then we'll just.	O
Contrast.	O
And the colour balance I'm just going to put some more.	O
Read into it again.	O
Just like in the previous email.	O
Be set up.	O
And then I'm just going to save this whole file one more time.	O
And then we're going to save this without the background.	O
Symphony from from from from.	O
Save it as_wage.	O
Against the machine and then open.	O
We're going to open the flat image.	O
Um, the anger based there is significant find.	O
It'll bring this one in the corner as a detailed reference.	O
And then we're going to change the size of this one.	O
212 hundred total pixels always duplicate it because it can kind of say at the bottom how the lines are faded.	O
So I duplicate that layer so I don't have to worry about that.	O
David.	CHITCHAT
When I hit the wrong button, getting all discombobulated.	O
Men will save it.	O
Range_once wells.	O
Save it.	O
We're kicking so much butt and then image size 56.	O
Will duplicate that layer one more time 'cause it did the same thing at the bottom and then will grab the pencil tool.	O
Make it 1 pixel.	O
No, just kind of clean up the details.	O
Same sort of things.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out and get some stuff then.	CHITCHAT
If you have any questions about anything, again, I'm more than happy to answer or do my best to answer.	CHITCHAT
Try my darndest.	CHITCHAT
To say words that make sense.	CHITCHAT
The nose is alright for now.	O

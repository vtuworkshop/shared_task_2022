Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Let's let the world go.	CHITCHAT
Get rid of some of these extra things that we don't need.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
All Right, This Is It.	CHITCHAT
We are live.	CHITCHAT
It is Wednesday night.	CHITCHAT
It's July, the first.	CHITCHAT
And I hope you are having a wonderful night.	CHITCHAT
Start off by toasting you all on this first of the month.	CHITCHAT
We've made it halfway through the year.	CHITCHAT
It's something.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
What we're going to do tonight?	CHITCHAT
Now that we've made it through half of 2020.	CHITCHAT
Is pick up.	CHITCHAT
The next.	CHITCHAT
Pick up the next piece of this project so.	O
Let's recap how we got to this little yellow little yellow fellow right here.	O
I'm going to zoom out on these are boards and take you over.	O
Take you on a journey, let's go back.	O
Let's go back.	CHITCHAT
Here we are.	CHITCHAT
So this this little friend right here, his name is chicken yellow chicken.	O
Yellow is an egg yolk.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Got hard boiled and Audi popped a.	O
Chicken or an egg yolk with a beacon leg swings.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
This project came from a friend of mine who, when he was much younger, didn't know the word for yolk and so he referred to.	O
A egg yolk as.	O
Chicken yellow, which I thought was adorable and gave me this idea for a character.	O
And so in our last stream we took this original vector illustration that I did and started to reimagine the character and build out a character sheet for it.	O
We refined that sheet and at the end of that first stream, we had arrived at this, this layouts.	O
We here we have a character turnarounds.	O
A character turnarounds is pretty common in character design.	O
You'll see them in most character designer portfolios, but these are amazing tools for designers and animators to really explore what a character looks like before you get into working with them.	O
So you know whether you're creating a comic book or an animated cartoon.	O
Whatever it is to really take the time to think through what that character looks like from all angles, as well as exploring their expressions and just getting a really good idea for how they move and behave.	O
Is really valuable tool, so we did that.	O
We then went and built out a color palette for chicken yellow just so that it would be easier to reference again in the future.	O
This control that zoom.	O
And then on Monday stream we talked about dynamic poses and.	O
Simplifying your character into really simple geometric shapes and using those geometric shapes to experiment with poses before actually recreating those poses with our character, and so that's what we did here with chicken yellow.	O
And then at the end of the stream we had a little bit of fun by adding a little bit of color to those characters, and so yeah, so that's where we are if you're joining in the chat tonight.	O
Thank you so much for joining me.	CHITCHAT
The goal for tonight is to take this character that we have here, bring it into after effects, get him rigged and and then create a walk cycle with this character and see if we can get that done before the end of the stream.	O

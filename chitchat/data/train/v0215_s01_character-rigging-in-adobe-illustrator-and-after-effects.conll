So again, if you are joining, please say hi in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to hear from you if you have questions.	CHITCHAT
I would love to hopefully answer them.	CHITCHAT
If not, maybe I can send you in the direction of a good resource.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, let me know who you are, where you from, and what you're doing tonight.	CHITCHAT
Already in the chat, we've got Jack Watson.	CHITCHAT
Othello be hints.	CHITCHAT
Streamer welcome, Jack.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a really good evening or afternoon depending on where you are.	CHITCHAT
So the first thing that I'm going to do tonight is too.	CHITCHAT
Take.	CHITCHAT
This three quarter view of my character and I'm going to start to think about what the rig for this character is going to look like.	O
And in doing that, what I want to decide before getting into after effects are just what sort of joints does this character need?	O
Where is he going to bend and flex?	O
And that will really speed things up once we get into after effects to create the rig.	O
Oh, that's right, Ohio.	CHITCHAT
Check your interval Ohio.	CHITCHAT
I can mostly speak awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yes, same time zone I too.	CHITCHAT
Leaving for me, so I'm enjoying a nice drink.	CHITCHAT
I hope all of you are staying hydrated.	CHITCHAT
But I'm going to now just zoom out and I want to grab a copy of.	O
That three quarter view of my character.	O
Trying to remember actually, let's just unlock all this stuff, so I'm going to grab this version of chicken yellow again.	O
This three quarter front view and this is the view of my character that I want to rig.	O
So I'm going to just create a really large canvas and a tiny character.	O
Let's make this character larger.	O
Alright, so we'll bump him up in size an.	O
I'm going to start prepping him to rig.	O
The basics of getting this ready to rig is to have a really clean.	O
In my case illustrator file.	O
You could do.	CHITCHAT
You could also do this with photo shop, but my sweet spot this in illustrator so we're going to work in there.	O
And um, before I do anything since I have a tendency to crash, let's name this.	O
Sigh rig.	O
So chicken yellow's nickname is, I see why.	O
Yeah, so the first thing that I'm going to do is really basic.	O
I'm just going to split out these different pieces of my character into layers.	O
And the reason for that is that there will be a whole lot easier to manage once I get into after effects.	O
So I'm going to create a hair layer.	O
Let's create a beak layer.	O
Is a beak?	O
Grab these.	CHITCHAT
Eyes.	O
Actually I'm.	O
Let's put those out as well.	O
So we'll name them left people.	O
This one will be his right people and I'm going to name things from the position of the characters, so not from how I'm looking at him, but from what his right and left sides would be.	O
So that is his right people.	O
Gonna grab that left wing.	O
And I'm going to put that in behind.	O
You also want to get the order.	O
Of all of your.	O
The pieces of your character worked out early on as well, it just saves you a lot of time once you actually get into after effects.	O
And for me, after effects is a newer tool and so the simpler and more straightforward I can keep it the better.	O
Business body drop that yolk in there?	O
Then we need two more, so we need one for the.	O
Right leg and one for the left.	O

In fact, we can probably do this with.	O
Simpler way would just delete that point will select these two bottom points and align them at the bottom.	O
At the bottom of the selection.	O
Not of the artboard.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Join him and then I'm just going around.	O
Around the bottom and that gives me something nice that I can kind of use that anchor for foot.	O
And then his foot Wolf connect somewhat like that.	O
So for that I'm actually going to make a second circle is about the same size.	O
And it's close enough and I'm going to use that to kind of guide where this foot is going to connect as well.	O
That we will have a pretty clean joint between the leg and the foot, and I can kind of just overlay these two circles.	O
Just see how that looks.	O
That, I think is going to work.	O
Cool OK, so I'll clean up the foot.	O
Anne will just try and get the.	O
Still line up a little more smoothly, that's good.	O
Going to take the two shapes there and join them.	O
And actually, if we won't do that, let's make a copy of this.	O
Alright, so I'm going to take these two and using the Pathfinder tool.	O
Oh, you need them.	CHITCHAT
And then I should have.	O
It doesn't work cool.	O
Oh silly, let's get rid of this point right here.	O
And then just smooth out.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
And then I'm going to.	O
What I want to do here, I want to hold this in slightly.	O
Apps.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so this is going to connect to the foot about here.	O
Great.	CHITCHAT
OK, so that gives us 1 foot.	O
And then I think what I'm going to do is just make a copy of this right foot, send it to the back and are left foot will.	O
Will just be a copy.	O
And keep it simple.	O
For the first pass through, I'm just going to get rid of.	O
So shadows.	O
Alright, so let's save the rig.	O
I do have to go back in and.	O
Get rid of this leg here.	O
Create a new left leg.	O
We are just about ready to get into after effects.	O
Oh, actually, we should create separate layers for the legs and for the feet.	O
So there's one leg, two legs.	O
Let's cut the.	O
Left foot That will cut this one.	O
And this is going to be right foot.	O
Say that I'm just going to reorganize this so that the legs and feet are together, so now my layers are named.	O

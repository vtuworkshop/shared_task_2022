You can do it.	O
Alright, let's.	CHITCHAT
Shrink down the screen so that all of you can see what I'm doing.	O
Get it into a window size that will fit this stream.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to make this window a little bit bigger than this one.	O
I'm going to make just a little smaller.	O
Like so I'm going to get rid of a couple of.	O
Panel so they don't need.	O
Don't need the brushes right now.	O
Alright cool, so this is going to be where will spend?	O
Probably the rest of the evening before we do that.	O
Let's also I'm going to bring this back up.	O
Like so.	CHITCHAT
Alright, will take one less look at our good old friends illustrator.	O
Save this other file.	O
And will quit out of illustrator.	O
Clear that clipboard.	O
We don't need it.	O
And let's get started in after effects.	O
Which is now not displaying.	O
So let's fix that.	O
There we go.	O
OK so I have after effects arranged a little bit differently than than you may be used to seeing it so by default when you open it, you're going to see a layout that's a little more similar to this where your composition, your work area kind of takes up most of the space you got your timeline on the bottom.	O
And then your project and all your project files on the left and a lot of your other controls and inspectors to the right.	O
When you're rigging, you want to have really easy access to your timeline to your layer list, as well as to your composition so that you can actually look at the character value rigging.	O
But I also want to have access to a plug in that plugin is duyck vassal, I think is how it's pronounced.	O
Let me show you really quick the beautiful.	O
Do it website.	O
If you are not familiar, duyck is a plugin for after effects.	O
It is free.	O
This is an open source tool which is pretty incredible when you think about what it's capable of, but do it is a.	O
Really, really in depth animation and rigging tool for after effects.	O
Again you can download it for free.	O
I've included a link to the plugin in the stream description below this video.	O
So if you want to check out do it.	CHITCHAT
Go for it.	CHITCHAT
It's amazing and it's free, so why not check it out and learn it.	O
The learning curve is a little bit sleep.	O
I've only just started experimenting with it and even in this stream we're going to scratch the very, very surface of what this tool is capable of doing.	O
But it is.	CHITCHAT
It is so cool how easy it makes the reading process, how easy it's going to make creating a walk cycle.	O
It's amazing.	CHITCHAT
I'm so pumped about this thing and I want to learn.	O
More and more about it, but this is the do it Basil site.	O
I've already installed this, but it is available for oh don't re download it.	O
I know you want to.	CHITCHAT
OK there we go cool.	CHITCHAT
You can download it for a variety of platforms.	O
And installing it is just a simple a simple rather as installing any other.	O
After effect plugin it goes into your script UI folder.	O
Once you've restarted, you have this.	O
This panel right here.	O
So this is the do it panel.	O
It has so so much in it so you can see here that there are rigging tools there.	O
Automation tools that you can use to help with animation.	O
The rigging tools allow you to create all different types of rigs for all different types of characters that can go from really simple human like characters that have structures like two legged humanoids all the way to four legged creatures and beyond kind of the Sky is the limit with what you want to build.	O
With the rigging tool.	O
Then there are all sorts of other animation tools that are a part of this and automations to speed up your work.	O
There is an in depth camera tool.	O
There are also like all sorts of utilities that will help clean up animations and simplify work that you need to do.	O
It's just amazing so.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited to get started in this.	CHITCHAT

I'm excited to share what I've learned so far with you, and to make mistakes with you and see.	O
Just see how this goes.	O
Before we do that, let's just check back in with the chat here LMAO.	O
Has returned.	O
I in says Jack Watson could guess what I ordered.	O
Also never used after effects, only illustrator and Photoshop started August last year working well.	O
Let me tell you about after effects.	O
I am still a noob newbie here, but this tool is awesome.	O
It just us so much.	O
I've watched Ryan and others create animations and all sorts of things do compositing in after effects and I'm in awe of that work.	O
I'd love to learn more of it.	O
Jack Watson asks now, is it pizza or is it pizza?	O
The question is what sort of Pizza Is It?	O
Alright, so to get us started reading this character, I am going to import my illustrator file.	O
And I'm going to bring up this window here so you can all see it.	O
There's a couple of things that you want to watch for when you are bringing in an illustrator file for this purpose into after effects.	O
And so first thing I'm going to do is just grab that illustrator file and then in the settings below.	O
You want to make sure that it is importing it as a composition and to maintain the layer sizes from illustrator.	O
If you don't do that, every layer of your illustrator file that gets imported will be the same size as the composition in after effects and so we don't want that.	O
We just want those layers to stay the same, so the shape of this foot is defining the size of the layer of the foot is on and so on.	O
So I'm going to do that and then open it.	O
You can now see little chicken yellow right here.	O
And so I'm going to shrink down this plug in just a little bit.	O
And let's open up that composition.	O
So here's chicken yellow.	O
As we left him with his joint markers.	O
Jack says, Uh, Oh Man, I am so bad at after effects.	CHITCHAT
I just learned how to use expressions.	O
I'm with you Jack.	CHITCHAT
I have taken a few courses that have introduced expressions, but I have not done much there either.	O
It feels like this is another tool like illustrator or Photoshop that you could really lose yourself in and.	O
You can go as deep really as you want to.	O
And it's for me.	O
It's a matter of time.	O
Like where do you, where do you invest the time that you have in learning?	O
All right, so we're going to call this stream rigging since I've done some experiments already.	O
An will place all of those pieces of it in the folder and will call this.	O
Site rig prep.	O
Just like that all right.	O
And as with most software, I'm going to keep saving this over and over again so that I don't lose what I've created.	O
And as we go I'm also going to probably version or make copies of this file at key points just so I don't lose the work that I've done in case.	O
Just in case I screw something up 'cause there's a good chance that I will.	O
I'm also going to open up some notes that I made as reminders to myself.	O
So I had that as we go.	O
Alright, so now we've got this file imported.	O
If you look over in the layer list you can see that all of those layers that I split out in the original illustrator file are already to work with, including my joint markers.	O
Um and we are ready to go and start thinking about this rig.	O
The one thing I want to check just before we get too far is just check my comp settings.	O
We've got it in a 5 minute duration, which is fine.	O
We don't need 5 minutes, but at least it's not too short.	O
I'm also going to just change the background to something that's not quite as.	O
Stark, and that's a good contrast with little chicken.	O
Yellow will say, OK.	O
Sometimes they'll work with it just on a transparent, but I think.	O
Think it'll work a little better?	CHITCHAT
Be a little easier to see on the stream in in this format, so we've got this ready to go.	O

And so when I open that, I get this cool little colorful inspector that pops up.	O
Called arm structure.	O
There are three different structures.	O
There's like a human or a plantigrade, a plantigrade arm.	O
There's a.	CHITCHAT
What do we call this one?	CHITCHAT
This is called a.	O
Did digitigrade.	O
Uh, which would be dogs, cats dinosaurs.	O
Then we have ungulate which are horses, cattle, giraffes, pigs, deers, etc.	O
We're just going to create a plantigrade here and customize it and so actually let's take a look at the arm structure for.	O
I know that's almost the same, will just stick with this.	O
So if we keep with the kind of humanoid form but take a look at chicken yellow chicken, yellow doesn't have an elbow, doesn't have hands, it's just a wing and so I don't really need an arm.	O
I don't really need a hand, I'm just going to use this forum.	O
I just need one piece that I'm going to pin 2.	O
And we will have to pin this to something within the body of chicken yellow, but we'll get to that in a little while.	O
For now, I'm just going to indicate for the plugin that I just need one component of an arm.	O
And so I'm going to close that now that I've said that option for the legs.	O
That's really similar because I'm creating a human like structure.	O
I'm going to want a thigh and a Cav.	O
I'm going to want a foot and toes as a part of my rig, and so I'm going to leave all of the options for a leg in place.	O
But getting to the spine.	O
This is where chicken yellow is actually going to be nice and easy to rig, and that's because chicken yellow has nobody, so his spine is really simple.	O
He's going to have you know, hips.	O
So we're going to leave the hips in place, but layers of the spine are things he doesn't have.	O
He doesn't have a head, he doesn't have a neck.	O
Um, in fact, actually will give him a neck, but we're not going to give him any spine.	O
And so they'll be a point at the hips and then will be a point for the neck.	O
And that's where I'm actually going to connect his wings when we get to the connection point.	O
So he'll have two points here, one neck, one hips.	O
So I'm going to close that option.	O
He doesn't have a tail and I don't need anything custom, and so now I can go back up to this hominid and just hit hit that and let it work its magic.	O
While it's doing that, which it did much faster than intended.	O
I'm going to take a drink.	O
Because hydration is important, Jack and Jack says I'm learning so much right now.	O
That's also that is so cool.	O
I too, am learning, so I'm glad that you are as well LMAO.	O
Be I'm just using an doing goos doing Wiles like Owen Wilson right now.	O
I need an Owen Wilson sound clip for this for this stream.	O
Best that I have for the moment is just a good clap.	O
Just appreciate what this plugin is done for us.	O
So far we have all of these structures in place now and if we zoom out a little bit you can see again that.	O
That my character is hiding it, but now we have this simpler humanoid structure that's been created and here are the options that I set.	O
So these are the two arm pieces.	O
This is my hips and neck structure, and then I have thighs, calves, feet and toes.	O
And with this in place I'm actually ready to move the structure in line with my character and so to do that I think what I'll do.	O
Just so that it's easy for us to see is I'm going to zoom out just a little bit.	O
Like this and let's.	O
Select all of the pieces of this humanoid and just move it over.	O
Ever so slightly so we can see them separately and I also.	O
Extend this for a moment.	O
Oh here we go.	CHITCHAT
Display options for my structure.	O
The other thing that I want to do is just make it a little more visible for us as we're working.	O
I don't want them all to be read.	O

Uh will go with it as it is.	O
Will just keep zooming in.	O
OK, so once you have all of these structures created.	O
Now we're going to connect it to the character, so we're going to lay the structure over each of the body parts, and I'm checking the chat Pablo has joined us in the stream.	O
Pablo welcome.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you found us on Twitter.	CHITCHAT

Mal will help translate since I unfortunately do not speak Spanish.	CHITCHAT
But now I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Pablo welcome.	CHITCHAT
It's great to have you here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to start with these wings.	O
And I'm going to start moving each of the pieces of this structure in line with my character and I'll grab it from this connector point.	O
Let's zoom into the wings so we can really see.	O
What we're doing.	CHITCHAT
So grab this point and I want to get into about the center point of that joint marker that I'd created in illustrator and then I want to grab the tipping point on the other side and just drag it to the end point of the wing.	O
And this doesn't have to be perfect, but the more precise you can get it I think the better you'll just have a cleaner rig when you're done.	O
And so that's the first piece of the structure.	O
Now Maps onto my character and I'm going to turn off the Beacon the head again so that we can see where is that body so that we can see the left wing as we go to map that.	O
Awesome Pablo can understand.	CHITCHAT
So yes, so welcome if you have questions or you just want to chat, please feel free.	CHITCHAT
It's awesome having everyone here to keep each other company.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy this time that we have together, right?	CHITCHAT
So again, I'm going to drop this into the center of that anchor point that I created.	O
Or joint marker.	O
And then we'll drag.	O
The other piece of the wing into place just so again going to zoom in.	O
Just to make sure I get it into the right place and you also have to make sure that you select these individual little.	O
Points for some reason I'm not there, we go.	O
Soon back in on this one.	O
Oh my goodness, we do it again.	O
Click outside of it.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I just want to drag this out.	O
To the very tip of this way.	O
Alright, so I've got those two wings mapped up.	O
Let's go over here.	O
Select everything in, turn off those anchors so we can see the layers.	O
Alright, so with that done, I can turn the beak and the body back on.	O
Save our work and now I'm going to map or start to move these legs over.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Mouse is perfect then such a shame.	O
I can't give you guys some pizza through the chat Adobe team.	CHITCHAT
Make it happen.	CHITCHAT
Please that would be amazing.	CHITCHAT
I can always eat pizza.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to grab these leg structure and you can see that when I grab it, although my head is blocking it when I grab it, it grabs that entire leg structure so the legs, the feet, they're all getting dragged together, which is exactly what we want.	O
So I'm going to move this over closer to the right leg.	O
And will zoom in.	O
And once again, starting at the very root of the structure.	O
I'm going to.	O
Just start moving this leg structure into place.	O
So again select.	O
The root of that structure.	O
And will zoom in so that we can get a little more precise.	O
Gonna put it about here.	O
And then I want to collect the point at which the.	O
Those thighs joined the caps.	O
The point of the knee.	O
Animal dropped out there.	O
Then I'm going to grab the points for the ankle.	O
And drag it into place.	O
And then you'll see that I have a foot and toes and their opposite to the direction of my feet, which is totally fine.	O

You just can still select it and drag that right into place.	O
And so the first part that I want to drop down is the foot.	O
And so this green.	O
I don't know if that comes through super clear in the stream, but this marker right here?	O
This is the foot.	O
And then there's a section at the end which is the to, and so I want the foot.	O
To come out to about the point where I start those bumps for the toes and the.	O
Reason for that is that if I'm going to have this foot bends or the toes bends, I want that to happen where where the toes actually form, and so because this isn't a regular foot, this might be a little.	O
A little finicky.	O
But we will do our best.	O
Oh, it sounds like we have a big thunderstorm rolling in right now.	CHITCHAT
This will help the stream.	CHITCHAT
Keeps going.	CHITCHAT
Just going to fine tune the position of the.	O
Of that foot that I was kind of messing with before.	O
And then replace the tip of the to so this tip toe point will go right about here will zoom out.	O
So now you can see I've made that structure smaller an mapped it to my character.	O
And here comes my dog to sit under my desk because he's afraid.	CHITCHAT
Of Thunder poor little guy.	CHITCHAT
Take a drink for Shiner.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's grab the next.	O
Structure, bring it over and just like before will map it now to the other leg.	O
So I'm going to put it in about the middle.	O
Do you select it and grab this point to put the knee in place?	O
Select the ankle.	O
And drop that into place.	O
Will grub at the end of the foot?	O
And then will grab that, oh.	O
And drop that into place.	O
I know it's really tough on little animals, whether it's fireworks at this time of year or or storms.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
They're scared of the boom to scary scary thing.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're really close now.	O
However, if you look down here near the feats and again, I don't know how clearly this is going to come out on the streams, but you can see these two extra points.	O
That are just kind of hanging out there, and if I select it you'll see that they're called heal and heal 2.	O
And so these are actually also a part of the leg structures, and what I need to do is take each one and drag.	O
It's the point at which the heel of my character begins an I think for mine it's probably going to be about.	O
Probably about here.	O
And that's the point at which if he rolls back on his heels or is heel hits the ground as he's walking, that's going to be the first contact point for the character.	O
And so I'm going to do the same thing here, where I'll drag that second heal point over.	O
To this character, let's zoom in this weekend.	O
Find to that position.	O
Like Belt there.	O
Well, it's a little higher up.	O
Let's make it lower.	O
Push it out there.	O
OK, so now that means that my legs with the heels defeat the toes.	O
Those are all laid out.	O
The wings are all laid out and I all I have left to move into place is my spine structure, which is made up of a hip.	O
Hips and a neck.	O
Because my character Lacks.	O
A true a true torso, so I don't have multiple pieces of a spine.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
If I did the thing that's really cool about these rigs is that it would break up a human spine into pieces and give you controls that you can bend the spine forward and backwards from side to side.	O
So if you wanted to make it like a human character dance the level of control that you can get in these rigs is.	O
Amazing.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I remain blown away by how cool this thing is.	O

So for the base of the Hipc I basically want to put that in between close to in between my 2.	O
Of the two hips here, so left hip and right hip and then the neck.	O
I'm going to bring out in fact pretty close to where it is.	O
I'm just going to drag it up a little.	O
Select it's point, which is going to drag it up slightly.	O
Hold shift to keep in a straight line.	O
Just like that and you'll also see that I attempted to keep including the legs, the structures as straight as possible because we want this kind of basic rig position to be a neutral pose on this character, and so this is the kind of at ease neutral pose for form a character.	O
All right, so we're going to save that, and that is the structures all created.	O
The next thing to do, and this will become more useful as we continue is to just go through the names of the layers that do it is created an make them something that you can work with later.	O
As you've already seen, I've gone from a small handful of layers to an awful lot and we're going to generate a lot more before we finish with the rig.	O
So going back in an renaming some of them to match our naming scheme is really helpful.	O
And So what I'm going to do is name.	O
The let's see hips or find the neck is fine.	O
The spine tip is fine, but the forearm.	O
I want to mark as right forearm, which for us is a wing and then I'm also going to Markov right arm tip, which is the very tip of that wing.	O
And then for arm 2.	O
I'm going to delete and that's going to be left forearm.	O
An armed tip 2 is going to be left arm tip.	O
Come here.	CHITCHAT
All right, we're going to introduce you to a scared lope up.	CHITCHAT

He's a.	CHITCHAT
But he's a good boy.	CHITCHAT
Be safe here under the desk so he'll be he'll be good and as long as our power holds out, this stream will be good.	CHITCHAT
So let's go in and finish renaming these pieces.	O
So we renamed the left wing pieces.	O
Now I'm going to name the separate the names of the legs so we have rights I.	O
Let's get that.	O
Stickler for spacing as well.	O
So this is going to be right calf.	O
This would be right foot.	O

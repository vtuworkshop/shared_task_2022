More pins renaming each of these puppet pins becomes very useful, so again we've got that second legacy.	O
We've chosen wing and so that first one we got our first pin in place.	O
Now we can move on and let's put a pin in the left wing.	O
Alright, I don't know if anyone can hear that, but we've gotta.	O
We've got big storm rolling in here.	O
Alright, I'm going to drop a new pin in place again, right in the center of that structure.	O
We're going to switch this to legacy and rename that puppet.	O
2.	O
To win.	O
Will save that and zoom out.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, next, let's do the leg.	O
So we'll start with the right leg.	O
Oh mouse got pizza here.	CHITCHAT
Gotta go for a second.	CHITCHAT
Grab that Pizza, Yeah, you heard that?	CHITCHAT
I'm, uh, I didn't know we had a storm plan.	CHITCHAT
Just take a look at the weather for a minute.	CHITCHAT
Heavy rain for the hour.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is going to.	CHITCHAT
This is going to go on for a little while.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's continue, will keep going for as long as we have power.	CHITCHAT
So right leg, let's zoom in into our right leg.	O
Go.	CHITCHAT
And so now I'm going to play spins in the leg and the way that that's going to work is that I'm going to create one at the hips at the knee and at the ankle.	O
I'm just making sure that I'm thinking that through properly, I think that's right, all right.	O
So let's start up at the top.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to grab the.	O
Puppet tool.	O
And zoom in, drop a pin at the.	O
Tip You'll see again, we've got that mesh into place.	O
We're going to create our next pinpoint right here.	O
And each time I place a pin, it's increasing the complexity of that match, and so we're building this series of polygons that is creating the mesh.	O
That is what is going to allow our our shapes to bend and transform.	O
And just as before.	O
You'll see here that I've got.	O
Each of my pins in place.	O
Let's switch this to legacy.	O
Actually, I'm going to back this up because I think something is missing here.	O
Let's come back in.	O
Go back one more time back one more time.	O
OK, so I've got my leg selected.	O
They drop this pin.	O
Switch it to legacy.	O
Drop the next one.	O
And the next one.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Cool, so those are three pins.	O
We've set that to legacy, so that is good.	O
And that's looking good.	O
Let's move to the left leg.	O
Zoom in and again dropped 3 pins, so one at the hips, one at the knee.	O

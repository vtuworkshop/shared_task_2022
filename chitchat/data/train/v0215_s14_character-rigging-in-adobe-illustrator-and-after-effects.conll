And one at the ankle.	O
Save it.	O
No will set them at the right and left feet.	O
And here I'm going to create a pin at the beginning of the foot.	O
And then the beginning of the toes.	O
We don't.	CHITCHAT
We don't need one at the tip toes.	O
We don't need one at the heel.	O
Save that and make sure that this is set to legacy.	O
Say that.	CHITCHAT
Same thing on the left foot.	O
Going to drop a pin at the beginning of the foot and the beginning of the toes.	O
Change the puppet engine to legacy and save.	O
OK, now last we need to create some pins for the body and we're not just going to create them for the.	O
For the Hipc, we're going to create them at the neck.	O
We don't need one at the head tip, but we do need them at the each of the Hipc.	O
Here, here, and each of these shoulders.	O
So like the beginning of the wings, the beginning of the hips.	O
And so I'm going to start at the bottom.	O
Here Holden will choose body.	O
And I'll drop my first pin.	O
Into place.	O
Go.	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to create a second one.	O
Brit here.	O
And then we don't need one at the tip.	O
But now that I've done that, I am actually.	O
Going to go back to the.	O
So actually that should be fine.	O
Back that up so we've created 2 pins so far, one at the hip and one at the neck.	O
We don't need to worry about the head tip.	O
But we do need to create them here.	O
At the right shoulder, scroll over.	O
Into the right spot here and we're going to create one at the left shoulder.	O
Then we're going to create one at the left hip.	O
Zoom out and then zoom back in and we're going to create one at the right hip.	O
So that's a much more complex mesh.	O
If we hit you to show when we create those puppet pins were actually creating keyframes on our timeline.	O
And So what I was renaming earlier, what I actually wanted to rename with these puppet pins, and so I'm actually going to go.	O
Back through each of these going to hit you.	O
And I'm going to just fix the names of these, so this is a wing.	O
Well, actually, just say.	O
Right wing This is the right hip.	O
So are hip.	O
El hip L.	O
A shoulder.	O
Our shoulders.	O
It's a case right here.	O
And then we've got neck.	O
And we got him.	O
And then we've also got this one.	O
This is Elwing.	O
This is uncle.	O
Me.	CHITCHAT
And hip.	O
Same thing here.	O
We have ankle.	O
Me.	CHITCHAT
And hit.	O
And then for the foot we have.	O
Close.	O
And we have foot.	O
Restart right foot.	O
Here's the other night foot which is close and.	O
But OK, so that all done.	O
We can.	CHITCHAT
Coming here.	O
Select everything.	O
And collapse it all back down.	O
OK, so now we have all of the pins placed, but they're not connected to anything.	O
Those are just pins in artwork.	O
They're not connected to that structure that we've made.	O

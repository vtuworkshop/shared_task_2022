And so we haven't really done that much with those actual pieces yet.	O
The one thing I just want to double check before we continue.	O
If I just hit you on this.	O
Is just to make sure that our puppet.	O
For the body.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Having some.	O
I have an old weirdness here.	O
Let's check here puppet.	O
Legacy, I knew it alright.	O
So I get that on the feet effects puppet.	O
Yes, I think everything else is good cool.	O
Alright, so we have created a structure.	O
We have added pins to that structure.	O
And the next piece is going to be.	O
More magic from our do it plug in and now that we've created a structure, we've created pins.	O
Now we want to take those two things and create the bones of our rig and so.	O
We're going to once again just select this label group.	O
And I'm going to go into the next step of the rigging process.	O
And I'm going to.	O
Go to this option.	O
Call dad bones.	O
And just hit that and it'll tell me if I've had an error.	O
It looks like I have.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what's going on here.	CHITCHAT
So we didn't get a full.	O
Set about.	CHITCHAT
So we're going so well.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Bear with me while I want to troubleshoot a little bit.	O
Structures look OK.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Say it again.	CHITCHAT
Pizza is gone.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy guys.	CHITCHAT
I love everything.	CHITCHAT
Oh that's that's pretty awesome.	CHITCHAT
I'm really happy for you now.	CHITCHAT
I hope that pizza was fantastic.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
We're going to try this again.	CHITCHAT
We've got.	O
All of our pieces here.	O
Let's try.	CHITCHAT
Going back in here.	O
Now it's still not happy.	O
All right, we're going to try.	O
Let's make this compositional is smaller.	O
I'm going to try to.	O
Grab the key frames.	O
That were created for these pieces.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Will just select all of those.	O
Alright, let's see if that works.	O
So we selected all the keyframes.	O
Family size Bon Appetit email Alright, let's see if adding bones will work now that we selected keyframes.	O
It looks like do it has been updated since I last worked with it.	O
It's doing stuff right.	O
Not going to touch it.	O
You're going to let it do its thing.	O
It's working.	CHITCHAT
Working hard.	CHITCHAT
And actually, as you watch this, you can now see little red pins getting dropped throughout the rig, and that's a great indicator.	O
Bible says unfortunately can't stay much longer.	O
It's really late here in Spain, but I'm definitely checking the vid in the morning.	O
I wanna see chicken yellow moving around.	O
Yes, Pablo, hopefully you will.	CHITCHAT
I really hope that will get there looking at the time I think we're going to get spot feeling good, but thank you so much for coming.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out with us.	CHITCHAT
Hope to see you soon and enjoy.	CHITCHAT
Get some sleep.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's zoom out here.	O
I'm going to try to close all the layers that were open.	O
Let's just go in here and there we go.	O
OK, so as I mentioned, we're going to get a whole lot of layers created as we work through this rig creation process, and so if I deselect all of this now, you can see that we've got our structures.	O

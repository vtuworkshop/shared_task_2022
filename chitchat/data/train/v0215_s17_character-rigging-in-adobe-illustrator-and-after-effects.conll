So the right foot art is going to connect to the right foot.	O
And the toes will connect 2.	O
Do you write toes?	O
The left leg and left hip will parrot to the left thigh.	O
Which is right here?	O
The left knee.	O
Will pair it to the left calf.	O
And the left ankle.	O
Parents who the left.	O
Foot.	O
OK, Lastly the left foot.	O
Art in bones will connect to the left foot.	O
Structure.	O
And the left toes will connect to the.	O
Come on.	CHITCHAT
To the left to's alright so it safe hopefully I parented all of those to the right places we will see if that actually is true when we start to manipulate this in a minute, but at this point now that I have parented those bone layers and the artwork to my structures.	O
Now I'm going to stop for a minute and I'm going to.	O
Go back to my project settings and just make a copy of this.	O
Rig truck and will call will rename prep 2 into pre rig.	O
So I.	CHITCHAT
Free Reg OK, we're making progress, so make sure that we're working in pre rig.	O
Make sure it's selected and we are on to the next set.	O
So next I'm going to grab all of the structures that we've created.	O
Now, since you entered the matrix like four times for my basic basic brain, well see I don't know what's going to happen when we get to these last couple of steps, because if they didn't work and I have to troubleshoot, I might cry.	O
Will see I wonder, have any of the behaved streamers cried on stream yet?	O
'cause maybe I could be the first.	O
There might be a badge for that that I could earn.	O
OK, so I selected all my structures.	O
And now we move into the next piece of what makes the duik plugin so amazing.	O
So at this point again, we've created all of these layers.	O
We have bones, we have structures, we have artwork, we have puppet pins with all of these pieces that still feel a little bit disconnected.	O
However, we're going to with one click, create the rig at this point and do it.	O
Does all of this for us.	O
This saves us an immense amount of scripting and just.	O
Knowledge we're going to bypass all that, and as long as we have rigged everything up correctly when we hit this auto rig button, it should connect everything for us.	O
So we're going to strap in.	O
I'm going to take a deep breath.	O
And we're going to hit the auto Rick Button with our all of our structures selected.	O
So we're going to wait.	O
We're going to let this thing do its magic, but what it is doing now is it is scripting all of the pieces of our character, the arms, the legs.	O
It's looking pretty good from what I can see.	O
I think I think we're in a good spot.	CHITCHAT
I think we're in a good spot, OK?	CHITCHAT
So now.	CHITCHAT
Here's what we're going to do.	CHITCHAT
We're going to.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Just collapse all these layers.	O
Now we have new controls that are in view and actually if we drag this over now, you'll see that In addition to the bones and the bones are these blue layers.	O
Then we have light green layers.	O
Now we have some new red layers and we also have some darker green controllers and the controllers are the key here.	O
My friends the controllers.	O
Will do everything.	O
They will do everything for us, so it will also probably help us at this point just to kind of clean up our view a little bit just so we're not trying to manage so many so many layers masses.	O
I would make one for you.	O
Don't worry, don't you worry girl, I got your back I want to see it come alive now you are the best thank you so much it makes me feel a lot better knowing that that you're there I don't have to panic 'cause I got I got the support.	O

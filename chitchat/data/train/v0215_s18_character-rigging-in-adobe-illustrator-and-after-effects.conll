Got it, so let's hide some of these just to clean up this layer view because it just looks way too complicated.	O
It's scary, so I'm going to select all of the structure.	O
Layers will select that label group.	O
I'm going to hide them, which is going to turn them off so we don't have that much noise in this view.	O
I'm also going to lock them and I'm going to shy them 'cause we don't really need to see those layers and will just turn on shy so it gets rid of.	O
Oh wait, I just hide the.	O
Oh, select this.	O
Come on.	CHITCHAT
Come on now.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's because I locked it silly.	O
Select that layer group.	O
Label Group We're going to share them.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Then we're going to lock 'em then will turn on shy.	O
So that gets rid of all the structures we don't need to see those anymore.	O
We're going to do the same thing with the bones, so I'm going to select that little group.	O
And then I'm going to shy those and what shine just means it's just hiding them from that layer view.	O
So when you're working on a really complex project, being able to shy things means that those layers is still there.	O
But you don't have to worry about messing with them or doing anything if you want to bring them back, you can just hit the UN shy button and there they are so we can bring them back.	O
Super easy, but I'm going to select this label group again of the bones and lock them.	O
And then we'll turn shy back on.	O
And we actually don't need to see our joint markers anymore, so I'm also going to turn those off.	O
Just like that, and we will also shy the joint markers.	O
And then I'm going to lock all of the artwork 'cause I don't want to mess up the artwork at this point.	O
Now says the green should be called the selves to honor, right?	O
That's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
I should do that and then send him my aftereffects preferences to show him the honor.	O
The honor that we have here.	O
OK, so now we're left with some artwork and some controllers, and if we let's do this, let's bring this in a little bit.	O
You don't need to see all of this.	O
Let's bring this over.	O
Now if I zoom in, what you can see in this rig and we actually now were an hour and a half into the stream.	O
We now have a character rig for chicken yellow and they are all hidden behind all sorts of scripts that do it has created and laid out and organized for us.	O
Obviously really meticulous, but once you get into animation, you'll see that like this.	O
Kind of detailed process really pays off because you've got this tool now that's so easy to work with, but let me zoom in and show you what we have.	O
So now we have like these skeletons that have been created.	O
You can kind of see a hip bone here is like a neck.	O
You can see a skull.	O
Open my wings there.	O
These little hand icons on my feet there a little feet icons.	O
And if I grab these, you'll now see that I can move these around, so I'm moving that wing.	O
Around.	CHITCHAT
But there's a few things that I want to do so that I don't mess this up before we start playing with the actual piece.	O
So first things I want to rename these controllers so that they make sense for my characters.	O
So again, I've got a left arm tip.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Silly.	CHITCHAT
Good left arm tip.	O
I've got a right arm tip.	O
I've got a left foot.	O
And they've got a right, but.	O
I've gotta shoulders and neck, that's great.	O
I've got hips and I've got a body and those are fine as those names not too worried about those.	O
I just wanted to make sure that my left and right are separated because though we won't get into a lot of it tonight, having those labels in that way, having those controls will just make more sense to you when you re open this file a month from now.	O
Or as you get into more detailed animation, you'll want these layers to be things that you recognize that are easy to work with.	O
So we've got all of that.	O
This is great.	CHITCHAT
Will save that and actually I think the other thing I'm going to do just to again, keep the Super simple.	O
Just going to shy.	O
These layers too, so all we've got on screen now in view are the controllers and under artwork.	O

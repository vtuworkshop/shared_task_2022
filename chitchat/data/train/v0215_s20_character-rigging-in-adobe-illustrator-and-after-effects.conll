I'm going to paste the controller properties.	O
Onto this foot so that it also is Scion and just make sure that that left foot is left mouse as I see chicken yellow has the moves like Jagger Hell yeah he does.	O
Alright, so those are the icons for our feet cleaned up.	O
Let's do the same thing with the arms.	O
So we'll start with this left arm tip here.	O
Oh, the other thing, let's get rid of some of the other kind of visual.	O
Uh, some of the visual mess in this.	O
So if we go into that anchor property, we don't really need to see the anchor, so I'm going to set its eyes to nothing.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
So we don't.	CHITCHAT
We just see the little foot there and I'm going to do the same thing on the right foot.	O
Will set that Controller Anchor.	O
2 nothing.	O
Great.	CHITCHAT
I'm also going to turn off the draw guides.	O
We don't see it on the feet, but.	O
It's just.	CHITCHAT
Just for completeness sake, so will save that, so that's our feet looking good, nice and clean.	O
Let's go to the arm.	O
Tips will start with this left arm tip.	O
You'll see here this green line.	O
That's that drawing guidance so I can turn that off in the anchor settings or not in anger settings in display.	O
Just uncheck draw guide so that gets rid of that Green Line.	O
I think I'm also going to make the icon for these same scion color.	O
I'm also going to just rotate the hand so that it's in the direction.	O
Of my character, and I think I could also just move it a little bit.	O
Let's do it this way.	O
That's not what I wanted.	O
Oh, you know what?	CHITCHAT
We don't say it's fine.	O
And will actually make this one.	O
Will put some opacity on it so we can see the wing through it.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
That's great, in fact, we just put those back.	O
We find right there.	O
Alright, so I think the other one I want to do is just get rid of its anchor.	O
So will set the size of the anchor to nothing.	O
But that will just go and again copy this one.	O
Over an also just make sure that that left arm tip is on the left arm will do the same thing on the right arm tip by pasting.	O
Will finish rotating this wing that was wrong.	O
That was wrong.	O
Just want to take this anchored.	O
There we go and the rest of those properties are great, but I do want to.	O
Make sure that anchors gone and then also go down to display and make sure that the draw guides are off.	O
Save that.	O
So let the dog under my desk.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we just have a couple more things to clean up and then we're going to walk cycle this thing before the stream ends.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now we have these headpieces and they're kind of.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
There are not in a position that I necessarily want them.	O
So what I'm going to do is select the.	O
Let's see, we'll start with the Hipc or no, let's start with the body.	O
Alright, let's switch this.	O
Let's get something a little calmer here.	O
There we go cool OK, so I'm going to just move this body position over.	O
So it's just out of the way of my character, so let's try it like minus 500.	O
Which is not far enough.	O
Let's try minus 1000.	O
Maybe a little more.	CHITCHAT
Basically just want the controller to be out of the way of the body.	O
I'm also going to increase its size just so that I can see it a little bit better.	O
Like that in fact, I'm going to move this a little bit more.	O
Like that, so there's my body out of the way just for consistency.	O
Also, just make the icon color the same as these ones.	O

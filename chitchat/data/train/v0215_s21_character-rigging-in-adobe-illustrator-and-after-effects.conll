Nice and bright.	O
OK, will save that.	O
And then I'm going to copy this controller over.	O
I'm going to grab the shoulders and neck.	O
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Solar movies, are they OK?	CHITCHAT
Can sometimes be nice to have the hips where they are, so first let's just make the size of this little bigger.	O
Now it looks like we're covering up his nether regions.	O
It's like modesty hips.	O
We probably won't even use the next, so I'm actually tempted to just hide this.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Only that I'm going to paste the.	O
No no.	CHITCHAT
Shoulder and neck.	O
Display no guides.	O
Body.	O
Anchor.	O
No anchor size on the body.	O
No anchor on the hips.	O
And all of these little things are really just preference.	O
You don't have to do what I'm doing right now.	O
It just keeps everything a lot cleaner if you do it.	O
Let's make this just a little bit bigger so we can see it.	O
And I'll select.	O
This, and actually this is kind of an annoying spot.	O
Let's pull this back to you.	O
Yeah, we'll just drop that.	O
There probably won't even touch the shoulders and neck piece.	O
It's just good that it's there, OK?	O
So with that, let's actually do some opacity on these hips.	O
Like so.	CHITCHAT
And I guess we could throw some opacity on their feet.	O
Who opacity there?	O
Something here.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
This stuff laying around here.	O
Stopping all right?	CHITCHAT
So we've zeroed out the controllers so that we can manipulate them and not have to worry about resetting our characters.	O
We've just need to make sure that the legs.	O
If we choose are somebody is set, just write the hips are good, the right foot is.	O
Let's close the controller.	O
Right foot is right.	O
The left foot is left.	O
The right arm is right, the left arm is right.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Saving it alright so.	O
Particular, thank you first of all for joining.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate you being here.	CHITCHAT
You ask, do you have any advice for someone trying to learn Adobe programs but not familiar with the programs?	CHITCHAT
So there are lots of great resources for learning the Adobe software, the probably my favourites are one hanging out on these live streams.	CHITCHAT
A great way to pick up tips, but to get started, I think there's great educational content on the Adobe site, so that would be my first place to go.	CHITCHAT
The Adobe live streams that happen.	CHITCHAT
This sponsored ones during the day, will often have more kind of beginner level streams that you can check out if you want something a little more guided.	CHITCHAT
I'm a big fan of Skillshare courses and I think those are really nice kind of bite sized ways to learn to learn software.	CHITCHAT
So I would check out skillshare.com and the other place that I would check out is domestica.org.	CHITCHAT
That is another site.	CHITCHAT
It is the majority of their courses are in Spanish, however they do have subtitles.	CHITCHAT
So you can check those out as well, but that would be my recommendation if you want to do online courses.	CHITCHAT
But now if you have some suggestions please, please do add them.	CHITCHAT
This is a stream that is free to all to answer questions.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate your help, so go for it.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to try a couple of things that we've now that we've done.	O
All of this.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So let's.	CHITCHAT

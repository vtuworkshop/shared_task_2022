Do some things here.	O
If I pull the spine of the body.	O
And I know I'm just doing this gently, but I don't want to kind of break what you're seeing in the stream, but you can see that when I pull that body controller back, the whole chicken yellow body is now moving backwards and what's locked in place are the.	O
Are the feet.	O
Everything is moving in.	O
The feet are stated position on the ground just like you want your character to do now for some reason my leg.	O
What did I do here?	O
Left arm tip is enabled.	O
Oh, interesting.	O
That's cool, OK?	O
Legal, don't mess with it.	O
If I grab the hips.	O
You can see and I can do this here.	O
But that's the icon.	O
Will do it here.	O
I can grab the hips.	O
Also an kind of swivel the character.	O
In fact, if you grab that and you get the rotation.	O
You can also rotate those hips so you could easily like swing the hips of your character if you wanted them to dance.	O
Now for chicken yellow, you probably have to do it pretty aggressively, and he's going to.	O
React in ways.	O
Let's back this up a little.	O
It's safe.	O
OK, so before I mess anything up, and because we're getting to the.	O
The last 1520 minutes or so, the stream I do want to see if we can get a walk cycle, even if it's a little messed up just so we can say we got there tonight together.	O
So let's check the chat again.	CHITCHAT
Amazing tips.	CHITCHAT
A mouse is did some courses, but just to pick up and use the tools and break the ice.	O
Strongly recommend the challenges type the Adobe program you want you want to go, let's say photo shop definitely.	O
Let me approve your link here mouse.	O
So yes, be hands.net/challenge/photo shop.	O
I totally agree with Malik.	CHITCHAT
Just getting in and trying things like try out all the tools.	O
Click on them.	O
That's a great way to get started.	O
I really like that pretty bad says I'm trying to get myself into interactive design and animation mainly for mobile app and web design.	O
Sometimes I try to follow YouTube tutorials but it gets overwhelming.	CHITCHAT
Oh yes, definitely so also now just shared with us here a link to be hence.net/challenge/X D.	CHITCHAT
So if you're interested in UI design then XD is a great program for you to learn.	CHITCHAT
It's a lot like Figma and sketch, but it's in the Adobe family of tools.	CHITCHAT
It is amazing.	CHITCHAT
It works seamlessly with those tools.	CHITCHAT
If you're also using them but XD will allow you to design user interfaces to animate and prototype interactions.	CHITCHAT
And it's probably, I think learning curve wise is actually a little easier to learn than some of these other tools, so I would check out those challenges that Mao has recommended on XD for sure.	CHITCHAT
That's a great great suggestion now.	CHITCHAT
OK, one thing I just want to try before we turn on our walk cycle and believe it or not we are just going to turn on a walk like walk cycle as long as I haven't broken anything here.	CHITCHAT
Oh, we should check to make sure my legs bend.	O
So this leg is not bending properly, so let's go to the right foot.	O
And in the IK foot we want to hit reverse so that it bends in the right way, and then we can do this and go back to a 0.	O
Zero position, let's make sure that the left foot is bending in the right way.	O
It is also not.	CHITCHAT
So let's reverse it.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
And then we will also set this back to 00 just to reground our foot.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I'm once again go back into my project settings and I'm going to make a copy of this.	O
Where are we right now?	CHITCHAT
Pre rig?	O
And we're going to call this one.	O
Rename will call this one sirig.	O
Make sure that it's the one that we're working in.	O
Sirig perfect OK.	O
No, let's pull this controller up here and.	O

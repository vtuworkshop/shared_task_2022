So let's zoom out so we can see our little buddy.	O
And will give him a little more room now.	O
The first thing I want to do just so it's pretty, is to move this icon out of the way, so will do it this way.	O
Yeah, that's good.	CHITCHAT
Let's throw it down here.	O
And then let's set it at minus.	O
1400 And then, because I'm a stickler for it, let's set the icon color to the same.	O
Mouse is, I'm waiting for your win.	O
Come on chick in.	O
Alright cool, thanks again.	O
Now this is a huge help.	O
Awesome, so going to hit save because I'm scared and let's let's just hit play.	O
Remove the do it.	O
Plug in out of the way to play and just see if in some way my character is walking.	O
Oh hold on, hold on.	O
We gotta show some more frames here.	O
Come let's show.	O
30 seconds.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Come on, let's go.	CHITCHAT
I keep shrinking down this play area.	O
One moment please.	CHITCHAT
Let's shrink this view down again.	O
Oh, I see what I did.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to move this preview pane off the screen so that we can see more of this, OK.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Going to hit the preview.	O
What is going on here?	CHITCHAT
Don't let me down.	CHITCHAT
We've had this incredible buildup.	O
Cash preview needs two or more frames.	O
Oh silly.	CHITCHAT
Alright, it's moving slowly.	O
I'm going to open up some of the properties and see if we can troubleshoot this a little bit.	O
OK, something is not working quite right.	O
Not giving up, not giving up.	O
Actually, maybe what I'll do because I'm fighting with all of these views, I'm going to grab my timeline.	O
And put it down here.	O
30 seconds.	O
And I'm just what I'm what I'm doing right now is just making sure that.	O
That I can see all of the.	O
All of the pieces of this oh, I see what's going on.	O
I was looking at the wrong time line.	O

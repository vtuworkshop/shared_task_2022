This is cipri rig.	O
let's just put this on the bottom.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm starting to lose a little bit of hope here.	O
There's something going on with our way.	O
Now we're not giving up.	O
I'm like the coach of rocky with the water bottle so pretty, but what we've been working on is rigging this character so it started off as an illustrator character.	O
And I've over the last, uh, couple of hours now we have used to plug in in after effects called Duyck to rig up this character so that we have controls to create a walk cycle.	O
Unfortunately though, right now this walk cycle is.	O
Not walking, I'm actually going to delete it and I'm going to try it again, so I'm going to go back into my plugin.	O
And I'm going to try this one more time.	O
So we're going to go and hit walks like A.	O
Let it do its thing.	O
OK, that looks more promising.	CHITCHAT
I see a little leg bend right there.	O
Oh, I see.	CHITCHAT
I see some legs moving.	O
I think he's walking backwards, but he's moving.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, he's he's moving all right.	O
It's not perfect, but he's moving.	O
Let's get him moving in the right direction.	O
Just moving really slow, that's going on.	O
Clock cycle walk speed.	O
Let's make it more dancing.	O
I wish this was OK, actually.	O
Let's also now change our resolution again, let's go back down to half.	O
Adaptive resolution maybe?	O
Or let's just do fast draft.	O
OK, so there's there's some movement.	O
It got a little bit of movement.	O
OK, let's speed him up up.	O
Walking speed crank it.	O
Still pretty slow, but uh, there's there's some movement.	O
There's some movement.	O
General motion.	O
She probably be at 100.	O
Let's check my.	O
Comp settings just to see what my frame rate is.	O
Frame rates fine.	O
Alright, so Jack says the discord links are all on the challenge pages at the bottom of the page is where it says join the community.	O
And yeah, and I believe each of those challenge pages has their own discord.	O
So there's like an illustrator, won a photo shop one I think I'm in those two, I'm not in an after effects one foreign XV when I should maybe join those two.	O
So those so we have some movement.	O
I think we have achieved walking.	O
We can say that there's a walk cycle now it's not moving really quickly, but it's it could also be just my computer is starting to lag.	O
It's very possible.	O
But however we do have some movement, so I'm going to say that that's good.	O
Let me show you a few of the few of the properties that we have, because there are also pretty sweet, so you have this general motion controller, and with it you can take them the character from walking to standing still.	O

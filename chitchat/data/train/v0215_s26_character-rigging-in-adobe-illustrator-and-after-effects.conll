Start them back up again.	O
Let's get it back up to 100.	O
So he is so general motion is walking.	O
Then you have these main parameters, so the character you can adjust their height.	O
So my character is actually pretty short.	O
This may speed him up.	O
We're going to pop him back down here.	O
And now he's got a little bit more of a cartoon you feel to his walk because he's shorter.	O
You can also set the weight of the character, which will have some effects on on how quickly they move going to increase his weight back up a little.	O
You can adapt the energy with which they're walking.	O
This is going to make it really crazy.	O
So now he's got this really outlandish.	O
Crazy walk, maybe a little too much energy.	O
Let's dial that back.	O
At 10 the softness I can't remember what this one does.	O
But I think it just makes him a lot more fluids.	O
You can kind of see now his body is rocking.	O
Let's pull that back a little.	O
Then you can set a walking speed so I could try cranking this and just see what happens.	O
Now he's got a.	O
Like a rubber band, Ministry of Silly Walks.	O
Walk to pull this back a little.	O
I'll say he's walking in a kind of an average.	O
Like 12 miles an hour or kilometers per hour so we could speed him up low.	O
Alright, so you can change that walk speed.	O
Uhm, you can also set the type of walk.	O
Is it realistic or is it more dancing?	O
The dancing is just a little more bouncy.	O
It's got a little bit of rhythm to it.	O
Then you have secondary controls and in the secondary controls you can really fine tune the characters.	O
So how much the next swings when the character walks.	O
So this is going to move my character forwards and backwards a little bit more will set that back to 0.	O
You can go into the body so within the body we can modify the swing of the body.	O
So if I make it really exaggerated he's going to swing his body back and forth as he moves.	O
This will pull that back a little.	O
Cool, let's make that even less just a little bit.	O
I'll give that a 10.	O
That's too much.	O
Let's go 6.	O
You can also set the up and down movement of the body, so if I make this really exaggerated.	O
And certainly doing very much.	O
So fine will dial that back.	O
The hips swing.	O
We can also modify and this is how his hips are going to move as he's walking, which will give him a little bit more of a strolie effects.	O
That back.	O
You can also then work with the arms and feet.	O
Now my arm swing is going to be a little different than a regular arm because I've only got just a little piece of the arm so his wings are going to move very slightly and then the arm softness is just the density with which those arms are going to move.	O
Or in our case, wings going to pull that back too and then Lastly, you can play with the feet and you can work on the feet height.	O
So how high up to the feet come as this character is walking.	O
How do defeat rotate as he's walking?	O
It's actually got kind of a nice feel to it now and then.	O
What is the hit the ground point?	O
How is that working?	CHITCHAT
So at this point, let's see it's 10:44 PM Eastern Daylight Time.	CHITCHAT
We've spent the last two hours.	O
Working on a a character rig for an illustrator that was created in or an illustration that was created in illustrator.	O
We then imported that into after effects and we use the do it vessel plugin for after effects to help us rig this character.	O
And yes it's taken us a couple of hours but the pretty incredible thing about this is though it took that time and it was very finicky work.	O
The amount of time it would have taken us to actually create a realistic walk cycle would have been far greater and it would have required a lot of tweaking already.	O
Now I have a rig that I can continue to work on and manipulate.	O
I can create walks and runs with this.	O
I can change the artwork on this and it's just at the end of the day.	O
If I stop this character from walking, I'm back to that plane rig post so I have this really powerful rig at my disposal now to work on animation for the character and to really focus on.	O

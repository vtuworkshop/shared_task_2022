How he's going to walk and move around.	O
So I think at this point with a character who is walking, even walking slowly, we're going to say that we achieved our goal tonight.	O
We imported a character from illustrator into after effects.	O
We rigged it.	O
We started up a walk cycle and I'm going to declare victory in the next stream, which will be on Friday the times I still have to determine an post.	O
I'll post those on Twitter and Instagram also.	CHITCHAT
Maybe update a schedule on Behance, but I'll do a little troubleshooting on this rig to get the walk cycle moving a little more quickly.	O
And once we've done that and have a walk that we're happy with, I'm going to add some blinking a little movement of the wings.	O
And will export that out.	O
My goal, by the way with this character, is to create a series of animations with him and export those using another plugin for after effects called Lottie and then import that into a web page for a web project that I'm working on.	O
So there's still a lot more to go here, but this has been a ton of fun.	O
I appreciate all of you so much for spending time with me tonight for hanging out for asking questions.	O
For giving me encouragement and support when I needed to, especially you mow and Jack, you're both awesome and really happy to be a part of this community with you and all of you have been hanging out.	O
It's a real pleasure to get to share my work and to learn right alongside you, but I'm going to rap things up for now, and now he's walking quickly.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
It's because I'm ending now.	CHITCHAT
He's rushing.	CHITCHAT
I think it's just my computer is, uh.	CHITCHAT
Is just dying under pressure, so this is great.	CHITCHAT
So we've got him walking.	O
He's walking a little too fast.	O
I am going to just slow him down because I can.	O
Let's get that walk speed dial back a little.	O
I just thought there is slow you down.	O
Oh, that's exactly what it is I think my computer is just struggling to handle this.	O
Anyway, we accomplished our goal for tonight.	O
I will come.	CHITCHAT
Continue to tweak, this will be back on Friday to do a couple of streams on Friday will also be doing an additional stream where I work on a new feature of of our streams that all of the behave streamers are are a lot of the hand streamers are participating in and that is something that we are calling the Adobe Adobe Weekly Challenge this week.	CHITCHAT
The topic is Quarantine Awards.	CHITCHAT
I will be working on.	CHITCHAT
Uh, some badges of very specific, different awards that you could win in Quarantine, so I'll be doing a bunch of vector illustration.	CHITCHAT
So if you're interested in that, please come hang out.	CHITCHAT
If you have ideas for badges that you might award people, think of like a Girl Scout or a Boy Scout sash that they would collect pins and badges on.	CHITCHAT
We're going to create a bunch of those along with the character, so if their awards that you want to see me create, let me know.	CHITCHAT
I'll be doing those on Friday along with some more work on this walk cycle, but yes, so without.	CHITCHAT
Further do oh actually Leslie before we sign off.	CHITCHAT
If you're curious about the plugin that I was using a link to, it is in the stream description just below this video.	CHITCHAT
The plugin is called do it vessel.	CHITCHAT
It is 100% free.	CHITCHAT
There are video tutorials and great documentation available on their website as well as really beautiful user guide.	CHITCHAT
If you want to buy something from them to support the work that they do.	CHITCHAT
But anyway again a free plugin do it bassel it creates these riggings an assist you in animation.	CHITCHAT
And and that's it.	CHITCHAT
That's it for tonight.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go get some rest, get ready for work tomorrow and again.	CHITCHAT
I thank you all so much for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
and I look forward to seeing you again soon.	CHITCHAT
Cheers.	CHITCHAT

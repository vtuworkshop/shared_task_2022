There's six characters total and I did all the costume design.	O
So just like.	O
Quick lose thumbnails of what their costume designs could look like, and now we're actually moving into the character paintings.	O
I know I did one of those on stream.	O
He ran be hands last time and we're going to continue where we left off on my Twitch channel.	O
So let Maine.	CHITCHAT
Let me show you this.	CHITCHAT
What is my camera seem so?	CHITCHAT
Hello there we go.	CHITCHAT
I spent so long trying to fix my green screen and it's all iffy now.	CHITCHAT
Oh well, what can you do?	CHITCHAT
So we got a lot of stuff, a lot of files here.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I'll show you the characters that are currently worked up.	O
All the costumes look like this.	O
You know these kind of little sheets of shape and color variations.	O
Apparently photo shops really struggling with this file.	O
That's not good.	CHITCHAT
Shouldn't be a huge file.	O
Think I recently restarted photo shop too.	O
So this is the leader character.	O
She's worked up a little bit.	O
I'm going into them now, working the characters up one by one, just roughing in nothing, nothing super polished or crazy.	O
This is the serious character these character designs are based off different characteristics.	O
That was the prompt for the challenge, so the OR the leader.	O
The serious character.	O
And then we're working on the brave character.	O
So that's where we are.	O
This is what we're going to be working on today.	O
You can see it just some of the flat colors are roughed in here.	O
I do the mask.	O
To create a clipping mask and I clipped these flat colors to it and that's where we are now.	O
So the goal is to get this character here up to the level of finish that this character in this character are, which you can see the really loose.	O
You can see how loosen rough brushstrokes are at this point.	O
But you know, figuring out a lot of the shapes allowed the color schemes, making sure it looks good in a simplified way is kind of the key here.	O
What's up NDAR?	O
A beer.	CHITCHAT
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
Hi bro, how you doing?	CHITCHAT
So let me see here.	O
Do you notice the backgrounds different for consistency sake?	O
I'm going to do.	O
Another background.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, so if you guys want to kind of follow along.	O
You can find the challenge page here.	O
I'll link it in the chat.	O
It's actually down below in the info, but if anyone wants to see it.	O
I'll put it in chat right now.	O
So if you want to see this challenge, if you've missed any of the streams and you're not really sure what's going on.	O
If you go to this artstation page and you go to the very bottom, you'll see that the oldest challenge, the first, sorry the oldest post, the first post, which actually was just yesterday, so I posted the initial sketches we did for this project.	O
The characters left to right are the brave.	O
Sorry, serious character, brave, joyful mischievious, wildan leader.	O
So we did all the poses.	O
The story behind who these people are and what each one of the members of the group does.	O
If you're interested in reading that at all, that's in the chat.	O
Then we have the costumes, so this is the serious character there, like a historian and scholar.	O
The brave character who were working on now.	O
The joyful character.	O
This is the next character will be doing after the brave one.	O
This is the Miss Chievous character, and these are all, like I said, just rough costumes.	O
This is when we were just.	O
Thrown down some ideas for what their costumes could look like.	O
This is the wild character who is a sort of soldier, and that's it.	O
I have one more to post to post the leader character, but I'm updating this a little bit slowly.	O
I'm kind of spacing out my updates a little bit, so I'll be doing the costumes for the leader.	O
Maybe some point tonight or post tomorrow if I feel like it.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and then that's it.	O
Then we have these characters to post.	O
I'll start posting the Ruffins I think.	O
So that's where we are.	O
Go ahead and grab my pen.	O
Where did I put it this time I was put it there such a strange place to put it.	O
So I'm going to bring in.	O
This document just as a reference.	O
To kind of know what this character should be looking like.	O
And then I got this mock up of the creature.	O

So I'll use that as a reference to.	O
That's kind of what they look like without all the clothing.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So the idea initially is to do flat colors.	O
And then I've been working up the painting a little bit, but I'm going to try to.	O
See if we can get the flag colors looking good.	O
Bro, I'm a beginner.	O
Please tell me something what, what, what thing do you want me to tell you?	O
It's very open ended.	O
So many things I could tell.	O
Are you saying are you asking for advice as a beginner?	O
Alright, so I'm trying to develop this flat.	O
It's flat color layer a little bit, so I'm going to go ahead and do that.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to try to get these flats perfect.	O
It's really kind of rough and loose.	O
Maybe my lines need to be a multiply layer, maybe that's why they look a little.	O
Yeah, that's that's a little bit that's helping.	O
I'm kind of being careful to lock all the layers.	O
I'm not using 'cause I have a bad habit of.	O
Painting on the wrong layer.	O
Yes, I'm general advice if you're a beginner.	O
I would say.	CHITCHAT
Make an effort to make drawing a habit.	O
Like if you can fit in and routinely like, make some point of the day where you have free.	O
Like time for art, if you can kind of get in your head each day that like Oh, it's this time of the day I'm going to draw for a little while.	O
Like if that kind of your creative time or your drawing time.	O
That goes along way, I think habits are really powerful thing so.	O
Consistency I think is what really helps you improve in the long run.	O
And if you can get in the habit of something, it requires a lot less effort to think about it.	O
Or to try to make an effort like, oh, I gotta draw today if it can just kind of become part of your daily routine.	O
Like Oh yeah, that's just what I do at this point in the day.	O
I just cannot sit down, drop off whatever.	O
I feel like I think that's great.	CHITCHAT
Another thing that's important for consistency is having fun with it.	O
If you're not like enjoying it.	O
It's going to make it really hard to stick with, so it's good to do studies, you know to do.	O
Like fundamentals and studies and all that to learn.	O
But in the beginning I think it's really just about enjoying it.	O
'cause if you kind of force yourself to do.	O
Tedious things you're not going to want to keep doing it, and I think a lot of times, that dedication in that.	O
Interest in doing some of the more quote unquote, tedious stuff can come after you been drawing for awhile.	O
So the point is, is really just have fun with it.	O
You know, drop things you enjoy, don't feel like you have to be drawing anything specific.	O
Don't feel like there's a proper way to be doing it, as long as you're kind of having fun with it.	O
And I guess adding on to that once you're drawing regularly and you're having fun with it.	O
If you really want to get better, try to keep an eye out for.	O
Let me rephrase that, if you want to get better, really, try putting in effort towards understanding rather than just copying.	O
Like if you're if you're drawing or painting something, try to understand why it looks that way.	O
Maybe you're looking from a photo, or you're doing a study from like a master painting or something.	O
Try to understand why things look the way they do, why they're working.	O
If you like an image by another artist, why do you like it?	O
What about it is working well when you look at your own art?	O
If you don't like something, try to try to develop your eye and be analytical.	O
You know it's important to be able to self critique your work.	O
What do you not like about it?	O
What do you feel you're struggling with?	O
What do you feel is weak?	O
So if you're going to have this analytical mindset when you're drawing about?	O
Why is something working?	O
Why is something not working?	O
What could be improved?	O
Why does this thing look the way it does?	O
If you kind of have that, like curious mindset, that will definitely help you learn.	O
So I would say those are my big things.	O
Try to develop a habit.	O
If you can make a certain part of your day for creative pursuits, drawing whatever you want to do.	O
So making it a habit is 1 #2 would be make sure you're having fun with it, 'cause that's going to keep you consist in the long run and three is just.	O

Make an effort to understand rather than just copy.	O
Be inquisitive, try to understand why things look and work the way they do.	O
And I guess a general tip for drawing is try to think in 3D space whenever your drawing.	O
It's like a huge tip.	O
Like trying to think of 3D volumes and shapes, cylinders and cubes and.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
3 dimensional objects rather than like flat shapes like rectangles and squares.	O
I was trying to think of kind of A.	O
3 dimensional space to what you're drawing will give it a lot more life.	O
I still have that hard station page up.	O
I don't have a perfect example, but I think it's probably in my first drawing that I showed.	O
You see it a little bit.	CHITCHAT
You see, like on this character I have these form lines that wraparound the form.	O
It's 'cause I'm envisioning her legs is cylinders, so having these form lines kind of help me visualize what direction in space her arms and legs are going.	O
You'll see that on his arms.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
For arm is going away from us.	O
You can see those form lines showing that and then his forearm is coming towards us, so you can see the form lines turn the other way.	O
Same thing with the form lines on this.	O
You can see some form lines on her arm there.	O
I probably had them on her leg.	O
Maybe they got erased.	O
But I'm really trying to envision all these things is simple 3D shapes in space.	O
When you're drawing is going to be.	O
Very helpful, that's that's pretty much the whole trick to drawing.	O
Trying to think about it all three dimensionally.	O
You can kind of see that too with the drawing on this guy I think.	O
Let's see like the scrolls on his arms are really just cylinders.	O
This book is really just a rectangular cube shape.	O
Mythologist basic shapes and perspective.	O
So when I'm drawing these things like this arm here.	O
This arm here it's all kind of like.	O
Analyzing what's direction.	O
These basic shapes are going.	O
His leg is kind of doing this.	O
So I use those tricks a lot when I'm drawing to try to envision everything is a.	O
3D form with volume.	O
So once I get the flag colors indecently.	O
Probably going to.	O
Jump into painting it roughly kind of see if we can get some.	O
Some of the general idea blocked in.	O

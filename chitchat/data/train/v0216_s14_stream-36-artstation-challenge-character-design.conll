So what I'm doing is first I just filled in flat colors.	O
I do line layer.	O
So did you drawing?	O
And then I made a mask which was originally just a flat color.	O
Um?	O
Which is like a single color to fill in the shape, and then I clip a flat color layer to it.	O
So I clip this layer to it, but then I merged the Blighter, so now my mask layer is my flat color layer.	O
It's the same thing.	O
From there.	O
I'm just painting.	O
Normally this is just a normal paint layer.	O
I'm just selecting.	O
I'm using this flat layer, so I'll use the magic wand tool and if you have.	O
Sample all layers checked off and you have contiguous checked off.	O
Basically, if I select the flat layer, if I'm on the flat layer and I select a color, it's going to select since it's all just one tone.	O
Since it's flat colors, it will select that whole section, but since contiguous is checked off, it selects all tones of that color in the whole piece.	O
So if there's blue somewhere that's completely not connected, it will still select it.	O
So that's like the green is going to select all the green the Brown is going to select all the Brown Bhutan, all the tan.	O
So on so forth.	CHITCHAT
So my colors are, my sections are separated by colors and their easily.	O
I can grab a real quick.	O
So what I'll do is.	O
I'll have my paint layer up and then I'll grab like maybe I want to paint this cloak, so I'll grab the green part.	O
I'll be selecting the flat layer.	O
I'll grab the green part and then I'll go back to my paint layer and I'll start painting on it.	O
And that way I have these clean selections.	O
I do press CTRL H to hide the marching ants, so now I can kind of.	O
Do this whole thing and pain in that section without any issue.	O
What you can do?	CHITCHAT
Todd hammington this is what I used to do.	O
Many moons ago, I don't anymore.	O
But she can create a multiply layer on top of your flag colors.	O
And you can use either a.	O
I mean you could like go to the flat color layers, select a section, go back to your multiply layer and you could use like a.	O
I usually select menu.	O
You guys can't see what I'm doing huh?	CHITCHAT
It's kind of.	CHITCHAT
A bummer.	CHITCHAT
What's up, baby, how you doing?	CHITCHAT
So I have this multiply layer here.	O
I have a round brush selected and you can see the color.	O
I usually go up around here and do this kind of blueish read somewhere in there.	O
It usually makes for a good shadow color and then from there control age to hide and you can kind of get this.	O
You can get gradients.	O
Well, you can also do is just using normal brush and kind of painted in pain in the shadows however you want.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Wrinkles and all that.	O
Same thing with like selecting the phase color and now I have that section of so I can.	O
Pain in shadows wherever you want, but the cool thing is on this multiply layer.	O
The shadows are going to look at good everywhere, so you could also make a clipping mask.	O
Just click that clip that multiply layer.	O
To the mask.	O
So you can't go outside and you can.	O
Just kind of paint away, you know.	O
So what I used to do I would take a hard brush with zero, pass it each other and I would kind of carbon my shadows.	O
So let's say the lights coming from the top left and I would basically make it like graphic.	O
You know, kind of.	CHITCHAT
Carbon the shadows and use the line layer to do that, like under the nose.	O
Wherever the shadows will be in the mouth.	O
Under the chin.	O
Maybe the side of the face is in shadow.	O
You could do this kind of thing right?	O
and I would kind of just carve it and then I would use the smudge tool.	O
You have to have the right settings on your smudge tool.	O
Like I have scattering checked on to 10% which helps.	O
But you could kind of self and up these areas where you want.	O
You could get some nice effects, so multipliers really cool just 'cause it you don't have to switch colors.	O
I don't do that anymore, I'll just paint directly.	O
I'm a little bit more confident with my colors and choices and that kind of thing now, so.	O
I'm a bit more comfortable just going straight into color, but that's something I used to do.	O
But yeah, now this is just normal painting on one layer, so I got my flats on one layer.	O

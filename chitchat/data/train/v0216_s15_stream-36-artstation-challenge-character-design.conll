I got my painting on one layer.	O
So that's what my flats look like.	O
That's what the painting looks like it.	O
It's easy to grab different selections.	O
With that flat.	O
Flat color layer.	O
I still still keeping hold onto.	O
So what you guys are going to see a lot is I go and I select the flag color layer.	O
I press W to switch to my magic wand tool.	O
I click on this section of color I want.	O
I press B to switch back to my brush I re select my pain layer and then I Press CTRL H to hide it.	O
I do it pretty rapidly so he keeps saying these random selections pop up just for a split second.	O
That's probably what you're seeing.	O
Yeah, no problem Todd.	O
I'd love to see some 3D models of your characters.	O
I feel like that would be cool with all the textures and details.	O
Yeah, I've had people model stuff I've done before in the past.	O
A little bit.	CHITCHAT
Not a lot, but it's definitely always cool to see that.	O
But my main goal at this point, because they have a clipping mask on so keeps me in the lines.	O
My main goal is just to.	O
Stay as loose as I can with this character.	O
Or with these characters I'm trying not to get.	O
Into detail too early, I really want to make sure they they read early on and that's why you very rarely see me zoom in.	O
Most of it's done from this level of zoom.	O
And then I'll be able to tell if it's looking right or not.	O
5 something is really off.	O
I need to fix something any of that.	O
Tell pretty early on.	O
That's the goal, at least like when I was working on this character.	O
I fix some things today I was working on this character on Twitch earlier so.	O
Let me pull him over.	O
Zoom in a little bit.	O
This is what we have now after working on it, but before that.	O
That's how he looked.	O
So today's progress on this character was.	O
Pretty much this.	O
You can see the shape.	O
Changed completely well, not completely, but a good amount.	O
Actually, was that even at?	CHITCHAT
No, no, I think we started sorry we started here.	CHITCHAT
I knew there was a bigger change.	O
That's what it is now.	O
You can see the change in the pose quite a bit in the design and the lighting.	O
So the idea is to get it blocked in like this really early on.	O
And then I can look at it and determine from a loose standpoint, like before, I have to finish it and Polish it and clean it up.	O
Determine early on if I even like it if it's working or not.	O
And with that one it was bugging me like it didn't look good and it looked just boring and dull.	O
It's like very straight on all the edges and very rectangular.	O
And the initial sketch I did had some good gesture to it, so I tried to look at my original sketch and push that and then we change some color scheme stuff because.	O
The colour scheme wasn't quite fitting the character as much as I had hoped.	O

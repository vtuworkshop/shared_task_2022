Try to rough in the overall values, especially for like each section you can see I'm kind of.	O
Grabbing sections individually, colors individually.	O
Goal is to try to rough in.	O
The lighting for each section, which is a handful of brush strokes.	O
That's often easier said than done.	O
But just in terms of trying to be more efficient.	O
Try to get good contrast like knocking that light.	O
Light tone.	O
Midtown dark tone as soon as possible.	O
And not just like section perception, but try to make the lighting read well overall.	O
But just like I said, big brush strokes.	O
As few brushstrokes as possible.	O
Kind of thinking about gradients like getting a big gradient over that whole section of color and then.	O
Kind of playing with details after that, but if the gradient is there.	O
Makes everything else a lot easier.	O
If you can get the local color.	O
I mean this is at least my opinion.	O
If you can get the local color of each object like it already reads fairly well, right?	O
Like we don't need line work necessarily to tell what's going on.	O
And then you can get a big mid tone.	O
Or sorry, a big gradient.	O
That's most of the value work right there.	O
The right local color which is most of the color.	O
Now big gradient.	O
And then beyond that.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Like a mid tone.	O
Highlights shadow wherever it needs it.	O
Feel like it reads pretty well.	O
Again, that's kind of my.	O
Thought that's kind of my goal right now.	O
It's like where my heads at.	O
I'm thinking, OK?	CHITCHAT
Snuck in this but knocking this and that should be most of it, so we'll see.	O
We'll see how it works out for Maine with these characters.	O
That's kind of the I always have something I'm trying to get better at when I'm doing a piece like something I'm trying out or something.	O
I think will help me take my pieces to the next level will be better.	O
It'll be faster.	O
It will be more efficient.	O
It will be more enjoyable to paint that way.	O
There's always something and I'm like trying out.	O
And this time that's what it is.	O
It's like.	CHITCHAT
How quickly can I establish values?	O
And it's not like it's going to be super fast.	O
Yeah, this is not perfect, but.	O
So learning experience every time.	O
Hey, what's up Joanna?	CHITCHAT
How you doing?	CHITCHAT
Good to see ya?	CHITCHAT
I should also mention that a lot of times when I have these ideas like oh maybe if I do this it would turn out better.	O
I usually have.	O
Alright, at least oftentimes have artists who I'm looking at that are kind of inspiring that.	O
So right now, Sir GEICO Lsof.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that's how you pronounce his name.	CHITCHAT
Ah and Peter Jablonski.	CHITCHAT
I think there is another one, but.	O
The way they use like angular brush strokes and really chisel and things quickly.	O
The way they do fabric and clothing is always super impressive to me.	O

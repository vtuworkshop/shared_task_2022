I don't know if it's up to the level of finished at the other characters are.	O
Possibly.	CHITCHAT
I think I do like this changes.	O
I'll save it just to kind of keep that as a little trial version.	O
I'm going to try one last little thing before we go.	O
Think My 2 favorite layers play little role here.	O
I'd like to do a multiply.	O
Layer.	O
I do a multiply and color Dodge for.	O
Lighting and shadow all the time, so I'm going to pick a bit of A.	O
Control shift I to invert the selection.	O
Color Dodge for a boost in the lights.	O
Gotta pick a pretty dark color.	O
I usually do like a really dark, desaturated yellowish orangish color just to get like a warm light.	O
You don't need.	CHITCHAT
You can go pretty dark with this.	O
It blows it out pretty quickly.	O
So there is some light in the main area around the.	O
Along with chest and all that.	O
Let me see if that helped it all.	O
Sometimes it just helps focus the lighting.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's pretty good.	O
So off to come fix some of these issues.	O
Next time I think the pose is looking a little bit better with those.	O
Adjustments.	O
So I have to come and clean that up next time, so I'm going to save it here.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I think looking at all those together, I think it baby actually look like around the same level, right?	O
Same global finish.	O
Yeah, I think so.	CHITCHAT
To come back and look at it again, but I'm think I'm pretty happy with that.	O
Like very, very rough, very loose.	O
I may work on his telescopes, telescopes, not painted it all somehow ignored that even though it's a really cool part.	O
Same thing with his crossbow in his dagger.	O
All his items I didn't paint for some reason, so I think next time come back, fix those little pose issues that we did.	O
And paying his items, it'll take like 5 minutes.	O
Just do a few brushstrokes in each one to add a little dimension and it will move on to the next character.	O
So I'm pretty happy with that.	O
Pizza came gotta go for a little right now.	CHITCHAT
Be appreciate you hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy your pizza.	CHITCHAT
Pizza sounds good.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So if anyone is new to the stream.	O
I am doing the art station challenge.	O
I'm going to put that in sheds.	O
In case you guys aren't.	O
Aware so it's 6 characters.	O
These are three to six.	O
And I'm pretty happy I got three roughed in.	O
Nowhere near done, but I'm happy with the rough in.	O
And if you go to my artstation, I updated this recently, I need to put this project on be hand still.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
There is my profile for my artstation, but if you go to challenges here, I'll actually just post the challenge.	O
You click on view submission.	O
You can see my challenge progress.	O

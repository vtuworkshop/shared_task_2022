So far I haven't updated all of these obviously as you are seeing images currently that are not on here but I will be in the next couple days so if you go to the beginning you'll see the story behind this challenge.	O
The story that I made up for my particular characters.	O
You'll see the description of each character, so these are the six here.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And we worked up three of these now, so it's still going to do 3.	O
You'll see the costume designs for each one.	O
I have one more costume design to post.	O
I may do that tonight.	O
But this is a really good way to keep up with the progress of it and any likes.	O
Any views even are very much appreciated.	O
Trying to get a little bit more visibility with this, 'cause that's a big part of these challenges is there can be a lot of eyes on it.	O
So if anyone wants to give it a like or anything like that, that's very much appreciated.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Did it not let me post that second link?	O
About this challenge.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it posted the first time, but I put it.	O
Put the challenge link in there as well.	O
So if you guys wanna check that out, feel free.	O
If you want to keep up with me, twitch, Twitter, Instagram, be hands of the best platforms to do so.	O
Twitch an be hands.	O
I stream several days a week.	O
You can see my full schedule on my pin tweet on Twitter.	O
I also have a story for it on Instagram and on my behalf profile.	O
You can see behind schedule, but I stream like five days a week between the two platforms.	O
Twitch, no Twitter, Twitter, iOS post.	O
When I'm going live going to be late if there's a schedule change.	O
If I have any artist share anything cool to share anything worth while I do it via Twitter.	O
That's a really good way to keep up with streams.	O
And Instagram is all are just all art sketches.	O
Just now the pictures, so that's a good way to keep up with my heart.	O
If you guys want to do so an artstation now I guess to be hands and Artstation both portfolio websites that I'm going to try to keep updated, so feel free to check those out.	O
But like I said on artstation, you can keep an eye on these challenge entries.	O
So once I have these characters roughed in I'll start posting those two so that will be pretty soon.	O
So I'll be back on streaming tomorrow on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
I stream like 11:30 or 12 Pacific Time.	CHITCHAT
Earlier in the day and then on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays.	CHITCHAT
I stream here on be hands.	CHITCHAT
So I will be streaming on Twitch on Thursday tomorrow and then on Friday earlier and then on be hands going to have two Twitch streams and then might be hand stream again which means we may very well be on a completely new character.	O
Or you guys may miss a character on this platform, 'cause I'll be doing a character tomorrow.	O
I don't have much more to do with him.	O
He's roughed in.	O
I'm going to leave him there for now and then I'll be working on another character and then will probably work on that.	O
Will be 4.	O
Will probably be doing the 5th character here and be hands.	O
If my guestimate is correct anyway, I'm just kind of rambling at this point.	O
I appreciate you guys being here hanging out with me, especially if anyone liked or followed or any of that stuff here on being answer elsewhere.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for thanks for the follows.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that's it.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I was missing one thing.	CHITCHAT
No, this is pretty much it next time I'm here.	CHITCHAT
Next time, stream will just keep plugging away at this challenge and hopefully I can finish it by July 13th so wish me luck.	CHITCHAT

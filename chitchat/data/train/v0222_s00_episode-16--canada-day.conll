It's not fully fully out there, maybe maybe not so perfect.	O
We fixed it nice, alright, so let's go to my green screen for a second perfect.	O
Welcome to my office welcome welcome.	O
So today we're going to be doing is we're just going to be kind of, UM, doing nothing, really.	O
Uhm, I'm gonna be doing nothing today, only because, um, it's Canada Day.	O
And like technically, I probably shouldn't be like live streaming today on Canada Day, but I'm going to anyways.	O
I'm going to do it.	O
I don't mind it.	CHITCHAT
I don't mind it at all, all right.	O
So what I'm gonna do is, uhm, let's go to our, you know, let's say let's make like a Canada Day Komposit or something right click let's do something about Canada today.	O

Good old Google Alright.	CHITCHAT
So let me just go to pixel squid.	O
What search Canada?	O
Now I'm not 100% sure what I will be doing yet.	O
But up, but yeah, let's let's just do something like Canada kinda related thing.	O
It's kind of hard to get like that.	O
That idea right away, so let me go on Adobe stock.	O
Here sometimes I like to browse this for like.	O
I don't know inspiration or something Canada.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Looks like there's a lot of nature going on.	O
The CN Tower?	O
That's pretty cool, but I got a new chair, by the way.	CHITCHAT
I like changes, colors and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can change it.	CHITCHAT
OK, well I made a red.	CHITCHAT
As cool as that is, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of.	CHITCHAT
I think it's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
It cuts me out nicely and it's really comfortable like I can now like put my feet up and everything and like I could just kind of like I can just lay all the way back.	CHITCHAT
You know if I wanted to take a nap like Midstream now I can just like just pass out, you know.	CHITCHAT
Just kiss like shot, right right, back up to its regular stance.	CHITCHAT
But you know, I I uh, this story about this chair is that, UM, I got for my birthday for my girlfriend.	CHITCHAT
And then she actually we had a problem with the leads around it.	CHITCHAT
They weren't like working so we had to actually try and figure out a way of how to return it.	CHITCHAT
And so we we went through that whole process and they end up giving us like a full refund on it.	CHITCHAT
And they said keep the chat.	CHITCHAT
So I'm like, OK, well I guess I'll I'll keep the chair so we so I kept it.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm just kinda.	CHITCHAT
Now I just kind of a chair.	CHITCHAT
I have a chair in the Mail and I have a chair here that's like fully working 'cause since you got a refund on it and everything I was able to open up the bottom of it because I just had no regrets whatsoever anymore with it.	CHITCHAT
And I end up just kind of like opening up the bottom of it, connecting all the wires and everything back together.	CHITCHAT
All that kind of fun stuff, and yeah.	CHITCHAT
So I just got out.	CHITCHAT
I don't really want to do anything like to like.	CHITCHAT

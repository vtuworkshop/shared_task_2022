What's this one look like?	O
Might be yeah, might not be in our true focus.	O
Right here, looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Will just cover that up with like a rock or something.	O
OK, let's license that.	O
That was, this is the previous, uh, this is the previous setup that we did.	O
So look at the last stream if you want to figure out how to make something like this.	O
But let's grab.	O
Downloads alright so Adobe.	O
Photo shop perfect.	O
And perfect there we go.	O
Now let's find that rock need a rock.	O
I wonder if my Mike's doing good.	O
It looks like it's doing pretty.	O
It looks like it's picking up a lot, which is nice.	O
Does this make a difference?	CHITCHAT
Like if I if I turn it up a little bit like that good, that should be decent.	O
Oh, that's nice on.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's go to our.	O
This refresh, this super Canadian at our rock in there.	O
Oh, I forgot to crop my canvas once I.	O
So I'm going to crop the bottom half off there, 'cause I don't really need it perfect.	O
Ladder will add our element in there.	O
And I'm just going to rotate it so that I get that leg black kind of front there.	O
Like that most likely perfect.	O
All right, and then I'm just going to stretch this out a little tad bit.	O
Giving myself like, you know.	O
Little bit of space to work with, perfect.	O
Make that high resolution.	O
Turn off the shadows, the shadows.	O
We don't really need them 'cause.	O
Can't see him.	O
In like way way below the rock.	O
All right now, let's get rid of that yellowish color 'cause it doesn't match these rocks.	O
Increase some of that levels right now I'm not doing any destructive editing, by the way, 'cause it's like a.	O
It's a smart layer.	O
We just basically want to create like a rocky kind of kind of base.	O
OK, so let's add another rock in here.	O
Just so that I'm not controlling both of them.	O
And we'll bring this one like.	O
Up front like that.	O
High res shadows off and then I'm just going to move these smart elements like up into this rock too just to blend it all all together again.	O
So just going to throw that on there and then the human saturation perfect.	O
Area.	O
Meant OK.	CHITCHAT
Now let's bring our super Canadian in here.	O
Alright, that that works pretty good for now.	O
Hi rez, I'm going to keep the shadows down there just was like an indicator.	O
I know that they're wrong but.	O
I just kind of want to indicate I can always turn it off at the end so it doesn't really matter.	O
So I knew tested these capes definitely don't want the shadow on that one.	O
That's pretty good, OK, and then we're going to need like.	O

Should we just say like a?	O

Make that make that the same color as his Cape there.	O
Ha ha ha.	CHITCHAT
Is there like a?	CHITCHAT
It's like this, right?	CHITCHAT
Hey.	CHITCHAT
Now looks like so wrong, but OK, let's I'm going to just duplicate that, put it into the mask and then overlay it.	O
Oh wait, now I think I'm just going to color.	O
Wait now.	CHITCHAT
Linear burn and I'm going to turn it down to like.	O
60% yeah, 60 should be pretty decent.	O
And then I'm going to just going to boost the brightness of this.	O
Because I wanted to see the ripple inside the shirt there now.	O
It's kind of like all following through with it, which is nice.	O
Is there yellow on this guy shirt?	O
It's like yellow paint here in there.	O
OK let's.	CHITCHAT
Let's turn off those shadows, and then we'll just rasterize that layer.	O
I just don't like these yellow little Prince for some reason.	O
Is not yellow all over him.	O
Like dude, you got mustard.	O
You got mustard on your shirt, man.	O
And you're acting so like.	O
So hip.	O
So cool, alright.	CHITCHAT

His hockey stick like.	O
Is that going to be his, his weaponry or whatever?	O
I where would I put the hockey stick?	O

I'm just guessing here.	O
Alright, let's look for the hockey stick in here.	O
2nd, it's like a goalie stick, but you know that's alright.	O
I just don't really know where to like.	O
Put it, you know.	O
It doesn't really have like like a nice spot, but it could go in.	O
OK, so I think what I'm going to do is I think I'm just going to throw it through his fingers there and then.	O
It's going to pop up behind his shoulder.	O
So let's add a layer mask that let's let's increase the resolution all the way up to our full potential here.	O

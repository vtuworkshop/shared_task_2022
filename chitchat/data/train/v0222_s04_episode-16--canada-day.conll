Perfect and then let's add that later mask.	O
And then I'm just going to go in with the eraser now.	O
Going to put their opacity down a little bit, this is something I'm good.	O
Just back to normal again after.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
Need to figure out a good location for it.	O
That should be OK, alright, so let's get the eraser going to set back to like a heart.	O
Pretty hard brush on here.	O
80% capacity, 100 'cause we're just a racing right now.	O
And I'm just kind of like a racing around the fingertips here.	O
So it creates like a little bit of an overlap.	O
Alright, that's not too too shabby.	O
Put this back down to our 90% there.	O
Maybe I gotta put it down to 8085.	O
70 70 Alright, go back to our mask.	O
Can I make my brush size a little bit bigger?	O
There we go?	CHITCHAT
Is this fingers like really aggressively big?	O
Like it shouldn't be so like massive like that.	O
Yeah, now that I look at it, it's like.	O
Dude, what happened to your finger up here?	O
Alright, let's go to liquefy and let's fix his finger because he's got something going on up there.	O
He's got like an extra like massive pinky finger.	O
But I think that warp should be able to fix it or liquefy.	O
OK, it looks so unnatural like.	CHITCHAT
The heck?	CHITCHAT
Right here.	CHITCHAT
Pinkies like extending so big man.	O
All right, hey back to normal.	O
Fish better than what it was before.	O
I'll tell you that.	CHITCHAT
OK, now I'm just gonna go to the hockey stick layer again.	O
I'm gonna just erase around here for a second.	O
Just doing that rough right now until I can see the full bring the full stick back.	O
Add toolbar go away.	O
Alright, now I'm just gonna kinda like just drawn here.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, he's already looked.	O
He's already looking like a like a Super Canadian A.	O
And I thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad that.	CHITCHAT
Uh, Yeah, I'm glad that you know that it is that that were celebrated.	CHITCHAT
I'm celebrating, I.	CHITCHAT
Like I know that a lot of people want to cancel it this year I do.	CHITCHAT
Agree ish to certain to a certain extent.	CHITCHAT
But like I just don't think that we should just like cancel everything right now because everybody's like upset.	CHITCHAT

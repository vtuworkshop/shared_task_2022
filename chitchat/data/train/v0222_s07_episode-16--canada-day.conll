I wish I had like 1 foot kind of like up so that he could just like have his foot on like a keg or something.	O
But let's just to see what we have here for.	O
Let's see what what elements like that I can policy work with.	O
Alright, so we need Maple leaves because we wanted to do the Kate like kind of transferring into that.	O
So Maple Leaf.	O
So let's just let's just do that that Cape technique first.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
That works.	CHITCHAT
Super Canadian.	CHITCHAT
Super Canadian.	O
All right, this should all work.	O
Pretty pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Still can't or flag in their men.	O
All right now.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to, um, add those into here.	O
We're going to just kind of like pixelated away, so let's go to RK player here.	O
I think we still need to make this high quality, yeah.	O
Perfect now alright keep textures back.	O
Alright, open up pics.	O
I don't know why I close pixel squid.	O
Alright, open that up, get some leaves in here.	O
I'm going to grab this pile leaves 'cause it's just a lot easier.	O
Sometimes I hit my foot with the chair or table and I immediately say sorry.	CHITCHAT
Yeah he just immediately after apologize to the table.	CHITCHAT
So I'm so sorry table.	CHITCHAT
I did not mean to offend you whatsoever.	CHITCHAT
I I think we all do that now at this point.	CHITCHAT
We've all just kind of like gotten into that whole like.	CHITCHAT
We just say it regardless all the time.	CHITCHAT
Now is at all times.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see if we can do like a nice like blend here.	O
So at first you're going to want to get like A.	O
A decent amount of red ones that front here.	O
'cause that's like your your edge, so I'm just going to keep duplicating this.	O
Don't worry about like the top of the key here, I'm just worrying about the alignment here.	O
Perfect and then right up here I'm just going to basically just erase those.	O
So reveal all and then it's going to go on with my my eraser.	O
And just get rid of those.	O
Now 'cause I have the White Russian I didn't do before.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
So far so good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we have to apologize to everything.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I like stub my toe and like I apologize to myself for stubbing my toe like Oh Man Chan, you're so nice.	CHITCHAT
Our our Cape kind of have like a white line around it, so I'm going to just select this.	O
Select inverse and then um.	O
Hide selection.	O
I'm going to do that one more time, select inverse, and now I'm going to click delete like 3 * 1 two 3.	O
There we go, now it's blending.	O
Sometimes elements like to create like this thin line Lake around there.	O
I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
They just like to do it OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll throw these top here.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
It's not going to rotate that.	O
And then I'm going to move this cave back.	O

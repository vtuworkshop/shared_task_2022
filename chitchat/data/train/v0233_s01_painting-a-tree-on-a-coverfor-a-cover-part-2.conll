How's it going every month?	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good today.	CHITCHAT
I'm ready, we are just about to start, repaint or continuing the painting of this here tree that we did yesterday.	O
Pretty excited, hello, more direction than yesterday, so I think we'll be able to get a little bit.	O
Thing going.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I should even add it on my Instagram.	CHITCHAT
Like nobody from is coming over.	CHITCHAT
They are going to paint this.	O
You're going to use a couple of textures.	O
From photos just to be able to get this.	O
Extra going real nicely.	O
And, Uh, Yeah so.	CHITCHAT
Let's begin, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Good.	CHITCHAT
Great.	CHITCHAT
You're watching the replay.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining me on the replay.	CHITCHAT
Really appreciate you guys.	CHITCHAT
Here with me live.	CHITCHAT
In here.	CHITCHAT
Now I've been streaming lot.	CHITCHAT
I just want to get all this work done and since I have permission to.	CHITCHAT
To you know, show it.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited.	CHITCHAT
Oh sorry Mike there.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited to be able to do it and then.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
The direction for this particular pieces, now that not not now, but because it was always.	O
Something about it being magical, but at least now I know what kind of magical it's supposed to be a hollowed out.	O
Burning tree trunk and show you a picture of that really quickly.	O
So it supposed to have this kind of look going throughout it.	O
Maybe in just a few parts, because they're also saying that they wanted to be subtle.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But they want it to be like.	O
It's only implying that it's magical.	O
It's not cousin in the book.	O
It's not fully revealed until much later.	O
So yeah, we're a.	O
Gonna be doing a little bit of that other client also requested that we have a little more color variety instead of just greens.	O
So we're going to try to bring in a couple of more, maybe Reds.	O
That kind of thing.	O
I'm also.	O
Going to do something with this.	O
This right here.	O
In fact, what we're going to do?	O
We're going to define that.	O
As a brush.	O
We're going to call it wheat.	O
Brush one.	O
And then we're going to do might not work because it's a whole bunch, but.	O
Schedule.	O
But what we're going to do is, we're going to go into our brush settings.	O
Cheap dynamics we're gonna do size jitter.	O
No control, we just want it moving minimum diameter.	O
I will leave it there, that's fine, angle jitter.	O
Just a tiny bit.	O
I'm going to go with a direction maybe.	O
Yeah, and I like that.	CHITCHAT
And then maybe some.	O
Mild scattering.	O
In the control being pen pressure.	O
Here try.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, kinda like that on the counter a little bit low.	O

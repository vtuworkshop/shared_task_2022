I think that'll work.	O
To save that as brush.	O
That's going to be a one, and then we're going to take one of these.	O
It already exists right here, so we're just going to grab this little guy.	O
So that we can define a couple of little.	O
Who's getting a little more?	O
Something point here?	O
Let's go with this one.	O
So in come in and just.	O
Make a few pieces that stand out a little.	O
Better.	O
We're going to define that.	O
Edit if I'm brush preset, excuse me, we're going to go right here.	O
They did that work.	O
I don't even know that.	CHITCHAT
And the person called that we kept 02.	O
Cheap dynamics.	O
As jitter go a little higher.	O
We do pressure.	O
That a lot more scattering than that, not that much.	O
Would you want the angle jitter?	O
Wanna be direction that there you go that's it.	O
Nice.	CHITCHAT
Did we add color dynamics?	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Foreground background.	O
You jitter yam.	O
Something that works.	O
Alright, let's see that as wheat 02.	O
And then in our brushes here, we're going to go ahead and get rid of the original, which is.	O
This one that one.	O
Leave that one.	O
And a leap.	O
Redial air.	O
And we're back.	O
Oh, right.	CHITCHAT
Marys Ryan Silvey making me pick between you and my girl to a cell.	CHITCHAT
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, this is secret stream so nobody supposed to be here so you can go to two cells.	CHITCHAT
It's fun.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for stopping by man, even if it's shortly.	CHITCHAT
I do appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we're going to get this this Bay sweet color.	O
And we're going to go ahead and know what I feel like that was good.	O
That is way too much count.	O
Let's drop the count on that.	O
Oh, you know what the scattering?	O
That's what we need.	O
That's it, right there?	O
OK, that's a lot better.	O
But don't yell it and people are going to know.	O
And if people know won't be a secret anymore.	O
Yoga.	O
OK, why is it only showing the bottom part?	O

I guess I don't need to cut that if it needs to believe we're just gonna leave it, leave it messy.	O
I like their little messy.	O
OK, so I was saying.	O
This tree needs to have little bits and pieces in it here, so I think I'm going to cut out this whole area right here.	O
Right there to create a bit of a hollow point inside the the.	O
Tree that will have its burning like that and the client like this one because she thought it was cool that I looked like lightning so maybe I can do a little something like that.	O
Make it look like some kind of lightning fire thing inside of the tree.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Might be cool.	CHITCHAT
And then a couple of these cracks that you see here.	O
These like long striations.	O
Will have like maybe a little bit of that burning inside of it.	O
I am very nervous to get this going.	O
I got a little bit of tree bark.	O
Uh, texture here.	O
We're going to use some of that right now to add some texture without having to worry too much about.	O
Painting it so clear.	O
To the point that I go crazy and break out in hives because it's not necessary right now.	O
But the problem here is just that we're not going to be able to use this whole tree trunk.	O
And get rid of some of this.	O
'cause we can't use these holes there way too recognizable.	O
For the most part, we're going to duplicate that, and then we're going to do.	O
Reduce Font Hill.	O
It's his fault he works.	O
Works for Maine.	O
Are healing brush also known as magic?	O
There man can't even tell.	O
Organize both both of those.	O
And then we're also going to use.	O
A lot of this one.	O
This will be our main tree trunk.	O
Let's see, we're going to start with the one with the holes.	O
I think the holes one.	O
So I want to be non destructive so always duplicate it.	O
We're going to call this one holes.	O
Base.	O
I'm going to call this one base.	O
And then we're going to call this one main.	O
Does that make sense?	O
21?	CHITCHAT
I don't think it should.	O
But it might.	O
In a group, these within the group.	O
These are the workable ones.	O
OK, so we're going to take this one with the holes in it.	O
I'm going to size it up.	O
In a little better here and then, we just.	O
The store either holding command or control.	O
Or warp.	O
Any of these will work.	O
Well, we can also do is use liquify.	O
Like to get a good base going with the.	O
Warp first.	O
And then back to our transform to scale it.	O
I like where that's going.	O
Who is it a little?	O
Yeah, like that, I'm a hit enter and then we're going to liquefy.	O
Filter liquify Excuse me We're going to also show backdrop so we know what we're doing.	O

And look here what's going on?	O
Got it so pixelated, uhm?	O
I guess this is reversed tree bark.	O
But what we're seeing in there?	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Danilo Parities, Bettys sorry, thank you for the follow man, appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Let's see I was here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to do a crack.	O
For here.	O
And in here.	CHITCHAT
Sort of following these this pattern that's like going like this.	O
And so we're following.	O
But we're doing it a little like segments like the line art.	O
It is joining me and you haven't seen yesterday's video.	O
This was actually drawn.	O
Bye bye and illustrator named Ted.	O
I believe that's his name.	O
And, Uh, I'm just doing the coloring for it.	O
You didn't see yesterday's video.	O
This is what he drew.	O
And then we cleaned it up and turned it into that.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
If you didn't see yesterday's magic.	O
This is all black and white.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
God find it.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Is all black and white.	O
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
Using a gradient map, we colored most of it like that.	O
So the gradient map is pretty cool, 'cause that's it.	O
Just targets your black values in your white values.	O
And then it just measures in between him and put whatever you put there.	O
So it was pretty cool.	O
So we're adding a little bit of color.	O
Then we painted over, added some fun colors with hardlight rendered and cleaned it.	O
And now we're here.	O
The little blur, very soft, very subtle.	O
Then something look realistic.	O
You go settle.	O
But where I lose my train of thought.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Where were we?	CHITCHAT
I'm already losing it.	O
We are here.	CHITCHAT
And we are trying to make.	O
History look a little magical.	O
Sooner.	O
It might throw people.	O
I've had a little allergies.	CHITCHAT
Anthony Carbajal, thank you for following me as well.	CHITCHAT
Appreciated by.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being here guys really.	CHITCHAT
Really appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Make him burning hot.	O
You put a little highlight in the center.	O
And go bigger to make it glow.	O
We're going to come back with a lighter color in some of these and make it even.	O
More hot.	O
Burning hot Think.	O
Murphy ever want to erase, but you're not sure how much are going to erase?	O
Use a quick mask.	O
You can always come back.	O

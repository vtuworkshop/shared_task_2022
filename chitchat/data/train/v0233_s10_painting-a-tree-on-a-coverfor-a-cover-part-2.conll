And I'm not saying You're saying that and then now it's become this thing where like people ask Hayward Brusher using an artist just can't tell you what brush they're using, but it's kind of become.	O
It's like swung to the other side of the pendulum.	O
But it's it's very simple.	O
Uh, as far as which brushes to recommend.	O
The only ones are used.	O
Are if you go to evidente.com or I think it's a YouTube video channel evidente concept art.	O
I downloaded that pack and I will tell you right now I have used.	O
One of these brushes like twice.	O
I like the tree brushes 'cause that kind of gets a lot of work done right away is just a tree, you know.	O
So that's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but I don't even use.	O
Oh Man, I could have used it the other day when I was making the thing.	O
But uhm.	CHITCHAT
So if you go to Evan and calm, you can download that pack.	O
I don't use it that much.	O
Novel series was a pencil brush that's not available anymore.	O
Uhm, I didn't create it, so I don't know if I can share it, but if I can I will.	O
I'll look into it and I'll post it on the acids later.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The ones that I use more and it's The One I use right now for particles, and I'll use it for the clouds and all this stuff.	O
Is the Mickey brushes and those.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
It's from a YouTube channel also.	O
Let's get on the YouTube's real quick.	O
And see if I can find it and if I can I will leave.	O
I will link it to you right now.	O
Yeah, the YouTube channel is Mathias Szymecki.	O
And dumb.	O
Look Well that he had the brushes it.	O
But that's his gum road.	O
I'm has some stuff there.	O
Uh, the link to his YouTube is, uh.	CHITCHAT
Not there.	CHITCHAT
This is as you too.	CHITCHAT
But so that those are some of the brushes I use now now, here's the thing.	O
I do most of my work with these right here.	O
These are my own brushes that I've created.	O
And those are available in the assets on most of my other videos.	O
I will put it on at the end of this video so you guys can grab him.	O
what I do.	O
Mostly these three is what I paint with.	O
And these are just modified standard brushes.	O
There's nothing special about them all.	O
It is is that my spacing is a little higher than normal.	O
It's either soft, semi hard or hard, so the hardness is somewhere in between there.	O
Unshaped dynamics I just have a minimum diameter of 70%.	O
And pressure control, which is standard, and that's it.	O
The transfer and smoothing is just default.	O
I don't do anything there.	O
And that's that's mostly what I paint with.	O
Which is why I rely more on like dropping in textures than the brush, because I.	O
Don't really use special brushes that much.	O
This debris one that you saw me use right here.	O
That's one of the few ones I will use just to kind of add a little more pop, you know.	O
Very cool, thank you for sharing.	CHITCHAT
I also customize brushes I use, but I'm always on the lookout for good brushes to manipulate for my purposes.	O

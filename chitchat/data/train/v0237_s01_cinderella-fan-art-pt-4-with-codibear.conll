I hope you all are having a lovely Wednesday so far.	CHITCHAT
A Steven Claire clever.	CHITCHAT
Yes clever.	CHITCHAT
My file is up today today.	CHITCHAT
As you can see, yay.	CHITCHAT
I was like kind of internally panicking this morning when I woke up.	CHITCHAT
I was like, please let my file be saved.	CHITCHAT
Please let my but we say.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So obviously we're going to be working on this Cinderella illustration today.	O
Um, we may or may not finish it.	O
I don't know the stream is going to be an hour and a half today if we don't finish it today then will finish it tomorrow, but we really don't have all that much left to do like it seems like there might be a lot, but in reality, like the back wall is all going to be one color basically.	O
And then I'll just draw in like line details for all the detailing and stuff like that.	O
And then I need to do like Cinderella's foot and like her skin tone and her little pools and stuff, but otherwise I mean we're pretty much kind of done and then just like last minute, like little details and stuff.	O
and I was considering also doing like a lighting layer like I did on like an overlay lighting layer like I did on my past couple of illustrations too, but.	O
I don't know if that'll look good on this one.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I guess we'll have to see.	O
But yeah, back it up twice.	O
Yeah, I really should.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I should probably start saving my work to the cloud.	O
Uhm, so yeah, let's let's just get into it.	O
How are you all doing?	CHITCHAT
I kind of woke up Anna groggy.	CHITCHAT
I actually made some tea, come with a very thematic Mickey mug today.	CHITCHAT
Thought that that was appropriate.	CHITCHAT
Drinking matcha tea?	CHITCHAT
Um, so I think I'm gonna grab let's actually let's grab the background color and I'm going to.	O
Saturated and darken it.	O
Uhm, see.	CHITCHAT
I I'm getting this color because I want to do some detail lines on the white things.	O
We have to figure out what color we want to do.	O
The detailing on those things like like the back wall, the pillars or headscarf, and her apron.	O
So let's lower the Opacity on her apron.	O
Um, do?	CHITCHAT
Make my brush lightly bigger.	O
This lines a little bit, then OK, that's too thick.	O
There we go better.	CHITCHAT
Actually pulled up this scene from the movie on YouTube and I have the the video just sitting here and wait because I was thinking that.	O
It might be useful to use as reference, especially.	O
I actually watched it this morning and I notice that I drew the candle abras.	O
I'm sorry the sconces incorrectly, uhm, so I'm probably going to go back.	O
They actually have two candles, one on either side instead of just one in the middle, so.	O
Probably go back and change that.	O
K let's bring up the apron layer to 100%.	O
I think I like that color.	O
That looks nice.	CHITCHAT
Hey Robert, Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
Happy Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I've ever had much of pieces.	CHITCHAT
Steven I'm on IRNB are you today are envy are you?	CHITCHAT
What's that?	CHITCHAT
I've never heard of that before.	CHITCHAT
Is that something that I should know?	CHITCHAT
I really like Machote alot.	CHITCHAT
Um, I mostly I'm drinking it today because it's the only tea that I have that has caffeine in it, so I needed to wake up for the stream.	CHITCHAT
And I also just realized, let's see, let's get rid of the sketch.	O
This part right here was actually a part of her apron.	O

It was meant to be a part of her apron that was showing, but I don't know.	O
I guess I kind of like it as like a little.	O
A little bunch in her fabric of her sleeve.	O
Yes, it's fine.	CHITCHAT
I'll leave it the way it is.	O
Oh iron brew.	CHITCHAT
Oh Is that a coffee thing?	CHITCHAT
So I'm not I'm not a coffee drinker, so maybe that's why I don't know what it is.	CHITCHAT
Like I I drink coffee like occasionally.	CHITCHAT
Really, I actually haven't drink coffee in a long time.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I kind of like forced myself to switch to T because I'm I'm actually like pretty, uhm, sensitive to caffeine.	CHITCHAT
If I have a full Cup of caffeinated coffee, I feel like I'm so jittery.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I, I feel like I'm having an anxiety attack.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, like I'm like I cannot handle like my chest hurts so super bad I cannot handle caffeine.	CHITCHAT
So usually when I would make a Cup of coffee it would be like 90% decap it.	CHITCHAT
Just like a little bit of calf.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's a soft drink.	CHITCHAT
Oh now I gotta look it up.	CHITCHAT
Iron brew.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I've never heard of it before.	CHITCHAT
I don't think, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I don't think they have it in America at least.	CHITCHAT
I've never seen it before.	CHITCHAT
Is it like orange soda?	CHITCHAT
It kind of looks like orange soda.	CHITCHAT
Iron brew totally sounds like it would have been a copy like 'cause Brew.	CHITCHAT
Like a really super caffeinated brew?	CHITCHAT
Scotlands other national drink.	CHITCHAT
Oh really.	CHITCHAT
Otis fire to have it with a good cigar and a smoky single malt whiskey.	CHITCHAT
I actually just got my husband for anniversary.	CHITCHAT
I got him some.	CHITCHAT
Whiskey tumblers and he loves space things so they have like um they have like constellations all over them.	CHITCHAT
They're really pretty.	CHITCHAT
OK, next let's let's see I could do like a little.	O
Line here on the end, do I like that?	O
I don't think I like that.	O
But let's lower the opacity of her head scarves.	O
And OK, so it looks like I just have.	O
Let's do like simple little line.	O
Do I like that edge?	O
Don't think I did, woops.	O
Smaller don't think I do.	O
Trying to keep the lines as minimal as possible and then I also realized this morning.	O
Then I forgot to let's see where is the.	O
Bucket layer right here.	O
And also forgot to paint in the inside of the bucket.	O
Which will be this darker breath?	O
Then Uhm, I could make the bucket water.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like the same color as your sleeves.	O
And I'm thinking that I will make another layer over top of that.	O
This one actually need to be above the bucket.	O
And I'm going to make this color and make it a little bit more sudsy.	O
Orange is the color, but it doesn't taste of Orange supposedly developed to help you rehydrate after imbibing too much of the national drink.	O

So time consuming.	O

The original seen by the way.	O
Yeah, see.	CHITCHAT

Thinking I could.	O
Do the bottom of the.	O
Rush.	O
Hey is this pink color?	O
I think I had actually uhm.	O
Colored the bucket before I changed.	O
Color of her dress.	O
Know that this color for some reason it looks a little bit more desaturated on the bucket then it does her dress.	O
Extreme savior word badges.	O
Yeah, for real.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Um, let's make a new clipping mask over top of the bucket because I want to do.	O
Some little.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So like what's the word?	O
Wood planks?	O

I totally just blanked on that.	O
OK, and let's do this just slightly slightly lighter.	O
I'm going to do just oops.	O
Make that a little bit more saturated, make some.	O
Wood grains, but I don't want it to be too distracting.	O
So it's going to be pretty light.	O
Yeah, it says when you were little, what Princess did you want to be?	O
Uhm, I really love fell.	O
Um, from beauty and the beast, and I also really loved aerial.	O
I think those are still both of my favorite princesses.	O
Although Cinderella is actually growing on me a lot, I didn't really used to like the movies as a kid.	O
But I re watched them on Disney plus recently.	O
House like wow even for as oldest Cinderella is.	O

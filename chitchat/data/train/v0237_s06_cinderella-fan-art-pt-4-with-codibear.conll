There's three movies and they were all really good.	CHITCHAT
I was like really surprised it was like, well, I'm going to watch these sequels just.	CHITCHAT
Why not because, but I'm not really expecting very much out of them.	CHITCHAT
But Uhm, I actually really like them.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I love The Little Mermaid.	CHITCHAT
My brother was actually a huge fan of The Little Mermaid.	CHITCHAT
So much so that like he had my parents like that was the movie that he watched over and over and over again like he like wore out the VHS.	CHITCHAT
He watched it so much that was.	CHITCHAT
That was The Lion King for me.	CHITCHAT
Like I would watch The Lion King and then immediately have my parents rewind the VHS so I could watch it again.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's just do this on the same layer.	O
Yeah, I love beauty and the beast also.	CHITCHAT
So another one of my top faves.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what color should I do?	O
The bristles of the brush I could do in these like this kind of like this to be color that I have.	O
Or The outline of her dress, although I don't know what the contrast is going to be like.	O
On the floor, but I guess we'll see, let's see here.	O
Yeah, we probably need to make it a little lighter.	O
As the contrast is not very good.	O
Like the same exact value as the floor.	O
Make it a little later maybe.	O
And I might even do that same.	O
Lighter color for.	O
Here too.	O
That way we're using the same color.	O
Eat that pallet minimal.	O
I like the live action beauty and the beast more than the animation.	CHITCHAT
I've actually never seen it before.	CHITCHAT
Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should put that on my list of things to watch on Disney Plus.	CHITCHAT
I'm just like personally I just haven't been a huge fan of the majority of the live actions that Disney has made.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's just because I'm a huge 2D animation fan.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, so maybe that makes me a little biased in that way, but.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
There's just something about the live actions that just don't have as much charm as the animated ones did me.	CHITCHAT
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo I have an older Cinderella.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if I can Google it Saarela illustration.	O
Pop up there is.	O
This is like the Bibbidi Bobbidi bibbidi-bobbidi-boo sing.	O
It still kind of like how the Magic looks.	O
I think that looks kind of cool.	O
It's like, well, scribbly.	O
Uh, that was back when I used like a Chucky more chalky texture.	O
Couldn't stay in the house, all that was going on.	O

But because on be handsy use your real name.	CHITCHAT
I mostly only know my viewers by.	CHITCHAT
There by their screen names.	CHITCHAT
So you gotta tell me who you are.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is looking good so far.	CHITCHAT
Actually I wasn't sure if I was going to like the addition of the pink, but I think I do.	O
I feel like it's that vintage like like yellow and pink were used a lot.	O
Oh OK, gotcha.	CHITCHAT
See now I know who you are.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
It's so cool to see you on here.	CHITCHAT
Did you see my tweet that I tweet it out that I'm live or something?	CHITCHAT
I'm curious to know if anyone even really.	CHITCHAT
I don't really use Twitter very much anymore and I'm curious to know if people actually come on here from my tweet because I haven't seen too many people from like Twitter and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
So I mean, I know I pretty sure you follow me on Instagram too.	CHITCHAT
So I'm wondering how you got here exactly.	CHITCHAT
Um, let's do.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you know what?	CHITCHAT
Now that we have, that addition of the pink the UM, more peachy skin tone for Cinderella will probably actually look really nice.	O
Uh, let's.	CHITCHAT
Turn the sketch back on.	O
And uhm, so it needs so her arms need to be underneath the sleeve layers, so let's do that.	O
Farms This is actually a little bit to paint, so it's not really the right.	O
The little bit too cool toned actually for this for this color palette.	O
Think I might take this pink color and just lighten it in desaturated and see what that ends up looking like for a skin tone.	O
No, that's even more red.	O
Yeah, that's to read.	O
I saw from Twitter I didn't know behind said this is actually the streaming on be.	O
Hands is actually still in beta.	O
You have to be invited to stream on the on the website.	O
But Yeah, Adobe, a kind of rounded up all of the old Twitch creative streamers and.	O
They were like, hey you want to stream on be hands now we're like a heck yeah, uh, we don't really know how long this is going to go on.	O
But like how long the beta is going to go on, but eventually I'm I'm fairly certain they're going to open up to the public, but I really don't know when or.	O
What that time frame looks like?	O
But yeah, I've been streaming on be hands three times a week for.	CHITCHAT
Like three or four months now.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I really like it and I also go on Adobe live over every once in awhile, which is uhm.	CHITCHAT
Like Adobe's official stream like they had on Twitch, but it's a little bit more of a professional stream where they do like the actual Adobe evangelists do master classes and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Extreme from Frisco and wasn't invited you.	CHITCHAT
You did join the discord, so it's possible that they whitelisted your account, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I don't know, it's uh.	CHITCHAT
I haven't heard anything about them opening it up completely to the public yet.	CHITCHAT
I'm fairly certain that they haven't.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, it's possible that like because you're like a regular in Adobe in Adobe live and things like that that they just whitelisted your account.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's turn this sketch back on and let's draw in her little foot here.	O

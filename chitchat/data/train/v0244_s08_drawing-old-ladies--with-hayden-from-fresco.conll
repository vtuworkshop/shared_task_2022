I did see that one he.	CHITCHAT
The previously On Brown, but I didn't know he did that often, but that's cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad he does.	CHITCHAT
I think it should be more common for artists.	CHITCHAT
In general, to kind of.	CHITCHAT
Do that.	CHITCHAT
'cause yeah.	CHITCHAT
'cause I used to animate 2D.	CHITCHAT
Back in the day, and.	CHITCHAT
We would always do this color background and that's why I still use it.	O
It definitely gets kind of weird color wise like it's not exactly a pretty color.	O
But I like it.	CHITCHAT
Now.	CHITCHAT
I want to make this wave match a little bit better.	O
I might delete all of this product.	O
Yeah, never mind.	CHITCHAT
Let's try a different brush for that.	O
And a few highlights here.	O
I don't want to spend too much time on this.	O
Which is a problem if you try to like, not spend time.	O
Unlike water drawing you end up.	O
It just won't look good because water is so tricky to draw.	O
But others purple shadow under here too.	O
Kind of ground here on here if we can.	O
I think we could do like multiply layer.	O
There now she's a little bit more.	O
3D.	O
Popping right off that wave there.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
See.	CHITCHAT
Do you have any other go to workflow tips Joanna asked?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Excuse me out.	CHITCHAT
That wasn't really loud drinking water.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I would say Let's see like Workflow or like health and stuff.	O
Uh, for workflow I always try to be like fairly loose with.	O
For example like.	CHITCHAT
With this I'm actually just trying to draw this like grandma here.	O
And Design her, but I'm also trying to learn your personality, so I'm actually doing more painting than I normally would at this stage.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Usually I would start really loose.	O
With any sort of Concepting at all.	O
And I'm not sure if that's kind of what you're asking about, but.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think it's important to let your brain kind of wander.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Also.	O
I'm going to duplicate that for now.	O

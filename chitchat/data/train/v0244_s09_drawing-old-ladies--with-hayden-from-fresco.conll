And.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, sometimes I'm really bad at talking while I.	CHITCHAT
Work.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put that other person off other guy off the.	O
Page so I can still keep that one up.	O
I'll get back into the workflow talk in just a second.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Yeah so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I always start really loose like this grandma started off as like this really nasty sketch.	O
Let me see if I can find it.	O
Here it was like this blob, and then I define from there.	O
Because if I.	CHITCHAT
If I don't.	O
But don't start like that.	O
I'll end up.	O
I won't have like the right shapes and stuff by the end of it and will take forever.	O
So that's one workflow thing as far as health and safety, I highly encourage you to take.	O
Like I breaks every like 20 minutes.	O
Just look at something.	O
That's 20 feet from you every 20 minutes and take like a two minute break.	O
Maybe stretch.	O
And I also definitely recommend.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just.	CHITCHAT
Stretching Being mindful of your wrist in general 'cause I have a lot of I developed a lot of risks.	O
Issues when I was working in animation.	O
But if you have any like specific like like workflow areas that you want me to talk about.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to.	CHITCHAT
Ask those questions 'cause I guess I could go into like.	CHITCHAT
General health or it could go into like high draw illustrations or how I do animations or how I do.	CHITCHAT
Story boards or how I think of ideas, those kinds of things.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, hydration is good.	CHITCHAT
I always forget to Hydrate.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, that's a good one from sticky.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
What should this grammar do next?	O
I'm going to have her walking this like shark dog.	O
I need to design this shark dog for my.	O
For the animation that I'm doing.	O
Yeah, hydration is good.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Are you guys?	CHITCHAT
People have coffee?	CHITCHAT
I tend to over caffeinate and that's Never good.	CHITCHAT
I take a lot of walks.	CHITCHAT
When I don't know how to solve a creative problem.	CHITCHAT
I'll just like walk around.	CHITCHAT
My block once or twice.	CHITCHAT
And there's actually a lot of studies about.	CHITCHAT
How walking makes you think differently and let's you kind of problem solved.	CHITCHAT
In a different way, fact like a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Companies are doing.	CHITCHAT
Walking meetings now.	CHITCHAT
Which I think is kind of awesome.	CHITCHAT

Because it helps me a lot, I almost always solve my problems if I just take a walk.	CHITCHAT
OK, great, we're on track then.	CHITCHAT
She says it's what she's thinking of.	CHITCHAT
You got it.	CHITCHAT
You got sticky says you gotta just mornings.	CHITCHAT
I have done the same.	CHITCHAT
And I used to drink light roast coffee.	CHITCHAT
And like Joanna said, I was kind of reliant on it in a way like for.	CHITCHAT
You know like for energy.	CHITCHAT
Not just energy, but like.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like.	CHITCHAT
It's like synthetic passion, a little bit.	CHITCHAT
We're like.	CHITCHAT
Where I used to just I would get excited by the idea and be energized and motivated by that.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
I started relying on kind of the coffee acceleration to give me like.	CHITCHAT
An extra bit of that, and pretty soon I just needed it all the time.	CHITCHAT
So now, yeah, just like sticky, I just have it in the mornings.	CHITCHAT
And I have dark roast which is.	CHITCHAT
A lot less harsh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's like.	CHITCHAT
I think sometimes with like.	CHITCHAT
Working at Companies and working for studios.	CHITCHAT
And you're still doing art, but you don't.	CHITCHAT
You still care about it, but it's not like.	CHITCHAT
It's not in the same way that I am enjoying drawing grandmas and dogs and sharks and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm drawing like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know corporate ideas and stuff.	CHITCHAT
So it's just not as like I still want to have that same surge of passion, but.	CHITCHAT
And usually won't really work.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Then I would do that, but it was kind of stupid.	CHITCHAT
I can just find other ways to find joy in the work.	CHITCHAT
Oh, intermittent fasting.	CHITCHAT
So do you like fast for the mornings then?	CHITCHAT
Or do you fast?	CHITCHAT

OK.	CHITCHAT
First, meal around 2:00 PM.	CHITCHAT
Also guys, sorry if my responses to comments and stuff are a little bit lagged.	CHITCHAT

So you're saying it, kinda like?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Dirty for a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Streaming so weird.	CHITCHAT
'cause when you're like Concepting, this sort of stuff like normally I just be like sitting at my desk like drawing the dumbest things.	CHITCHAT
And not really being conscious of it, but here you're like well.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
First meal is around 2:00 PM and last meals around 8:00 ish.	CHITCHAT
I kind of think like I don't know if I.	CHITCHAT
I definitely haven't done it intentionally, but that's kind of like how I tend to eat too sticky and I.	CHITCHAT
I wonder?	CHITCHAT
I should try it like.	CHITCHAT
I should try more intentionally like you are and see.	CHITCHAT
Like How it changes things for me?	CHITCHAT
Or like maybe I try like in more normal person 'cause I am not a morning person which is why I stream it.	CHITCHAT
11 or 10 at night.	CHITCHAT
Or a?	CHITCHAT
Early is because.	CHITCHAT
I'm just awful in the mornings.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely terrible.	CHITCHAT
Not even coffee would be good.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
So I just kind of don't even want to eat in the mornings high school I used to just sleep in until I needed to leave.	CHITCHAT
So I just skip breakfast.	CHITCHAT
So I've always kind of been that way.	CHITCHAT
Right, so this is weird.	CHITCHAT
So we're dog shark.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm glad it gets easier.	CHITCHAT
I do find like the more consistently I stream, the more used to it I get.	CHITCHAT
I just kind of like draw like it normally do, but.	CHITCHAT
If I take a long break like I just went on like a short vacation and.	CHITCHAT
Had some other stuff going on so I'm a little out of practice right now.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of creepy.	CHITCHAT
Did that in high school that I'm like.	CHITCHAT
I just do it around and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
The legs are still a little bit strange here, but I think I'll just do another shark in just a second.	O
But first I'll put like a collar on him, 'cause that would be kind of fun.	O
How long have you been streaming sticky?	CHITCHAT
Just not on B and specifically, but just in general.	O
Colour action going on here.	O

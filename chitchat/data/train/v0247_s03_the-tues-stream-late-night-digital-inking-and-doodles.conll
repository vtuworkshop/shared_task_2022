This is just something I started on yesterday.	CHITCHAT
And it was actually so.	CHITCHAT
This right here is something that I did in on this iPad five years ago in Adobe sketch.	CHITCHAT
When that first started when that first happened, and.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to see how I have evolved as an artist.	CHITCHAT
So I tried to recreate it.	CHITCHAT
I I change some stuff here and there, but I wanted to have the same sort of look.	CHITCHAT
In a sense.	CHITCHAT
There's no better way to judge if you've improved.	CHITCHAT
On something.	CHITCHAT
And then when you try to redraw something you've already done before.	CHITCHAT
I love the redraw moment, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Also, like I see I drew this knife, this this I drew this when Fallout 4 first came out and it was all about Fallout 4.	O
So this was like like my own little vault dweller.	O
But now it's like, Oh, I'm not really into fallout anymore.	O
I'm going to change into like a different type of character.	O
Something a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
And I know inventive, I guess.	CHITCHAT
Well then less of the norm.	CHITCHAT
I hope that you are having a good day.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to change and then I think I already dead.	O
Query solve this thing right here.	O
Oh, there's some ministrator race going to redraw it.	O
I like this.	CHITCHAT
Found them at all.	CHITCHAT
Will we be thinking that I have going on over there?	O
Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
Going to be a late night stream?	CHITCHAT
Well for me it's like 9 I'm on the West Coast, so I like the pipe on the weapon.	CHITCHAT
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
I love the post apocalyptic alive.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Can never say that post.	CHITCHAT
Popular post apocalyptic.	CHITCHAT
I've been tongue time lately.	CHITCHAT
I'm changing it to be a little bit more passive.	CHITCHAT
Be more of an Explorer rather than like a Hunter.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking like a globe, maybe?	O
Let's look this up.	O
Maybe like a globe compass.	O
Kind of looking thing.	O
Globe.	O
Comfest I'm on a different browser so I can look at stuff.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's the thing.	CHITCHAT
Say this.	CHITCHAT
That's fancy.	CHITCHAT
That's that's fancy as hell.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I want to do something like that.	CHITCHAT
I'll see if I could pull it off.	CHITCHAT
Well, see all that.	CHITCHAT
Trying new things.	CHITCHAT
Experimenting experimentation.	CHITCHAT
OK, all right there right there.	O
I love the globe.	O
Yeah, like for them too.	O
I enjoyed the globe a static.	O
Anyhow, you change, you evolve as an artist and it's like I used to be young and Angsty, and I want to stab things and then we grow older and it's like I just want to enjoy the world.	O
I just want to be a pacifist and go from town to town helping people.	O
Instead of wine that stabbed in the neck, you know.	O
Movies, that's how I like to see it.	O
So.	O
This is like really complicated, but I'm going to dumb it down 'cause I'm not.	O
I don't want to bite off more than I can chew.	O

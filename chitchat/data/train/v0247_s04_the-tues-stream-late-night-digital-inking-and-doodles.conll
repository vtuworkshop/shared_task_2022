Find some lines.	O
But not others.	O
And do this.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
This has to go, alright, you're not matching this static sorry bro.	O
Oops, wrong layer.	CHITCHAT
And that.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Baby, like a twisty twisty thing?	O
Let's see thing going down.	O
This twisted metal thing.	O
Oh, there's OK.	CHITCHAT
So there is a screw.	O
I blink sinking Lee high.	CHITCHAT
I cannot translate that.	CHITCHAT
Welcome the two, or might be hand stream if you could.	CHITCHAT
Say Hi in English, that would be much appreciated because I do not speak.	CHITCHAT
I can only speak English.	CHITCHAT
I wish I could.	CHITCHAT
I could speak a little bit of Japanese and a little bit of Spanish and a little bit of Filipino with I am Filipino, but that's about it.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of better gun here.	O
We're not going to put a gun.	O
As well as, this character is a pacifist.	O
So I'm going to put a water bottle in there.	O
Thinking for a water bottle.	O
And we gotta stay hydrated in the desert.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Man, we go back to here are inking layer.	O
Basic are drowned.	O
And then we go in.	O
And then we try to make sense of what we just did here.	O
Hopefully I can do that.	CHITCHAT
No promises though, I'm going to use an 8 then he's an 8 for the outlines of the edges.	O
And then when I get into the inside, I'm going to drop it down to like a three.	O
You really love you night, thank you.	O
So here's the thing about.	O
I'm trying to change things.	O
Usually I use a variable with brush and I'm very much into the thick and thin of things, right?	O
But a lot of artists that I look up to, especially like in Japanese comic book artists, manga artists, right?	O
They use a consistent line weight throughout a majority of their illustrations.	O
Like seems that a lot of them, well, I don't know this observation.	O
Love tend to use microns and microns.	O
They don't necessarily have a lot of like variability within like a stroke after using it.	O
I've been trying to emulate that.	O
So I'll use.	O
Oh, this is like this is, I think this is the 7.	O
It might like re outline the outside of it, but I'm using a 7 or 8.	O
As I make the.	O
Big blocks of identifying objects and I'll go down to a fire, so there's a lot more methodical, methodical.	O
It sounds like evil.	O
It's a lot more.	O
I think before I do a lot more planning compared to.	O
How are usually do things which is more intuitive?	CHITCHAT

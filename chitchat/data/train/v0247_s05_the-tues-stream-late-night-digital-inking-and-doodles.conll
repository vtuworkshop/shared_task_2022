Doing it this way.	O
And I actually like erase these right here.	O

But as you can see, I'll show you like I'll show you stuff how I usually in things.	O
So how I usually in things is.	O
This way.	CHITCHAT
Right here.	CHITCHAT
If you look at my line is very like.	O
Thick to thin.	O
So that makes sense.	O
Is variable in that like it's sick and then it goes into the sand and then Sinan then it goes into the thick and I love that.	O
The thing is I feel I'm too heavy handed when it comes to my lines.	O
Sometimes I make him way to take like that.	O
That's like super thick, right?	O
That's like super thick, so I've learned.	O
Some more glass more is less, more is less.	O
An consistent lines usually can read better.	O
It's less busier if you have too much line variation within something.	O
All at once, he gets like discombobulated and then the viewer gets confused.	O
I love cross hatching by thing across as too much.	O
So I need to quit it.	O
This is my way of re learning things.	O

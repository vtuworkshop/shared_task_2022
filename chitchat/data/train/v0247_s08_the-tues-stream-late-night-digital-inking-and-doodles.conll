I focused and entertainment or they call it Entertainment Arts.	CHITCHAT
But it was a focus on storyboarding and.	CHITCHAT
We did an animation.	CHITCHAT
Actually I love Council work.	CHITCHAT
I would be super cool if I work on video games, but I'm open to whatever the road take.	CHITCHAT
See, you have a lot of options for you.	CHITCHAT
Some.	CHITCHAT
Like right now.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of ways to get yourself noticed work wise so.	CHITCHAT
I'm aging myself, but back in my day back in my day back in my day.	CHITCHAT
I'd like paper portfolios and the only way to really get yourself out there is to make copies of your portfolios and then Mail them.	CHITCHAT
Or if there's like an event, then you would go like a Comic Con that you would go and then have your portfolio review by people now like Oh, you have a really popular Instagram wow then you can get hired pretty quickly.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Oh If you keep at it, or if anybody if anyone keeps on it.	CHITCHAT
I know like on the hands we get some students.	CHITCHAT
We got like people from all walks of life coming in here.	CHITCHAT
And if this.	CHITCHAT
Opens up to more people than will have like viewers from all walks of life coming in here.	CHITCHAT
You asking questions like How do I make it into the industry?	CHITCHAT
Things like that and it's like well.	CHITCHAT
You know that changes you know that might change.	CHITCHAT
You've never been good in social media game.	CHITCHAT
There used to be as I don't know if it's updated or not, but I would I would.	CHITCHAT
Right now the gold standard if you want to get into an industry like have a really good art station.	CHITCHAT
Lot of people look at our station.	CHITCHAT
We had this conversation last night.	CHITCHAT
Like if you need your own personal website.	CHITCHAT
And I've I've have an opinion like you don't need your own website.	CHITCHAT
People have been discovered having really good instagrams or really Twitter.	CHITCHAT
This yeah.	CHITCHAT
You don't need a fancy Instagram like I had someone in here saying like I have a website, but it's complicated and I'm like well if I was an art director.	CHITCHAT
And you linked me your website and it took me like 15 clicks to get to your portfolio.	CHITCHAT
I would be out of there the first 5.	CHITCHAT
Because I'm I'm there just to look at your work.	CHITCHAT
If your work stands on its own, that's what I care about.	CHITCHAT
I don't care if like if I click on your name and it zooms in and morphs into like a splash page and then like somebody narrate like you have James Earl Jones narrating your life story.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't care about that.	CHITCHAT
Care about if your work is good.	CHITCHAT
However, if you.	CHITCHAT
If you decide to sell your stuff like Prince and whatnot, I think websites is good is good for branding.	CHITCHAT
People want to know about you.	CHITCHAT
They want to know like a kind of consensus about who you are as an artist.	CHITCHAT
I had a website but then.	CHITCHAT
I got broken into for doing it.	CHITCHAT
So since you know things are commissions are looking a little bit better, I might reinvest into my website, get a different URL, and then 'cause I I've done print so I have a Nazi and I do principia commissions so it would be like helpful and I want to brand myself right.	CHITCHAT
Sticky like that's the brand actually have names Jason, but my brand is sticky.	CHITCHAT
That sounded like a sentence.	CHITCHAT
I brand name is sticky.	CHITCHAT
That's what I meant.	CHITCHAT
Brandy mistake here.	CHITCHAT
Kinda like being seen, but not as cool.	CHITCHAT
So I say if people.	CHITCHAT

Want to get involved?	CHITCHAT
I like students or or whoever you want to get involved with like.	CHITCHAT
Getting your out there.	CHITCHAT
Instagram is like an easy as an easy way to do it.	CHITCHAT
Too many people get caught up with trying to achieve numbers like for quickly like that's not that shouldn't be the point necessarily.	CHITCHAT
It it having Instagram and having a be hands right?	CHITCHAT
Having having a Behance is another way of doing it is not as recognized, but I think it's slowly right now.	CHITCHAT
I think if you're a graphic designer and you're an advertising having to be hands like.	CHITCHAT
A number one right has that that's the market right now.	CHITCHAT
That's the wave as people have been saying at the moment.	CHITCHAT

You're probably like celebrating their wedding anniversary.	CHITCHAT
They don't give a about lonely.	CHITCHAT
Have to say, OK, ideas are like a dime a dozen.	CHITCHAT
My whole thing is, if you're going to, if you want your stuff out there.	CHITCHAT
If you want to be recognized, you have to start with posting that.	CHITCHAT
Things that should do.	CHITCHAT
You can be cigarette if you can be shamed about the stuff that you have.	CHITCHAT
Bad or good?	CHITCHAT
I'm in the very much Mccary V sort of mentality, content, content, content you have to keep putting out content and they can't be 100% perfect.	CHITCHAT
It has to be like you know, good.	CHITCHAT
Please.	CHITCHAT
'cause people's attention spans are pretty like blood, right?	CHITCHAT
And you never know you post something you don't really think much of it all of a sudden like you get a call from Disney.	CHITCHAT

I tell them if you come to my stream, don't tell me who you are.	CHITCHAT
Don't tell me that I know you because I will act differently and I hate that I can never be myself.	CHITCHAT
Myself is very quote Unquote, with preserved.	CHITCHAT
I'm more I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Try not shy, shy, shy.	CHITCHAT
I'm sort of like that so.	CHITCHAT
And I've had happened before.	CHITCHAT
One of my best friends have came into my be hand stream.	CHITCHAT
And I was just like.	CHITCHAT
Ah, but I try to like muscle through it.	CHITCHAT
Try to muscle through it.	CHITCHAT
I've had other people and other streams then they come in anti freeze like a deer in headlights.	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm more free.	CHITCHAT
I'm more myself.	CHITCHAT
Because there is that wall of.	CHITCHAT
I can never pronounce the word.	CHITCHAT
Anonymity.	CHITCHAT
Anonymity right?	CHITCHAT
You are just user name of.	CHITCHAT
OK, you're just even though some of you have pictures, you are just like baseless kind of letters, and I don't necessarily connect a person to that in a sense.	CHITCHAT
So it's like I'm talking to.	CHITCHAT
Are robots and in a way?	CHITCHAT
I refuse to give my family my stream link.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't either.	CHITCHAT
My cousins like.	CHITCHAT
One of my cousins.	CHITCHAT
She was like, Oh, he walked like to my guy, cousin, their brother and sister, she was like.	CHITCHAT
He watched his strength and then I kind of froze and I looked at him and I'm like I didn't need to hear that I really.	CHITCHAT
I think why did you tell me that like I I I need jerk got offended 'cause like I don't need to know that crap, right?	CHITCHAT
If you watch my strings, just don't say anything and I if I'm if I see you in real life don't mention anything from past few.	CHITCHAT
If I tend if I say something and then you bring it up, I'm just going to like walk away.	CHITCHAT
I was going to go like I'm not going to acknowledge what you just said at all.	CHITCHAT
Let's change the frequency object.	CHITCHAT
I think a lot of people.	CHITCHAT
Like as viewers are the same way.	CHITCHAT
They become more themselves, 'cause like, honestly, like I've.	CHITCHAT
I've shared things with anonymous people on the Internet.	CHITCHAT
More so than my family.	CHITCHAT
More so than my friends.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think that's why streaming like the culture has gotten so big.	CHITCHAT
'cause you tend to find people that share the same viewpoints and the same interests.	CHITCHAT
And because of that you become more comfortable with them and then it's like, hey?	CHITCHAT
Now I've been streaming for like 6 Seven years 1014.	CHITCHAT
Next years.	CHITCHAT
And I've seen people come and go.	CHITCHAT
But with the takeaway I've I've gotten is that.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of different people from all different types of life and lot of 'em.	CHITCHAT
They don't fit in.	CHITCHAT
And streaming is an easier way for them to open up because it's like a clean slate.	CHITCHAT
Now you're a completely different person in your own persona, which is good.	CHITCHAT
Also, it's bad 'cause I got some creepy stories.	CHITCHAT
That's a weird story.	CHITCHAT
People being cat fishing and stuff.	CHITCHAT
So we gotta be careful, right?	CHITCHAT
You gotta be careful, OK, will brush do I use?	CHITCHAT
I'm using the for inking.	CHITCHAT
I'm using the hard round brush and I'm only going to like the bottom like in size 8 and Seven, right?	O
And then the point I'm sketching.	O
I use literally go to.	O
Sketching pencil that's what I've got to it.	O
Then I just showed you those two and that's it.	O
Bianchi had some pretty nice we are.	CHITCHAT
OK, so my observations.	CHITCHAT
So I started on Twitch so I know the gaming side and I know the another game inside and I know the creative side came inside of hype.	CHITCHAT

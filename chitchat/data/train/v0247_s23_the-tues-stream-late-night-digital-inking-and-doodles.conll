I think an art studio like maybe it will be soft or something.	CHITCHAT
Right, so all of this stuff is learned.	CHITCHAT
I think talent miss miss guides people into thinking like I cannot do this because it's it's something that you're born with and that's that's a very unusual anyone can do this right?	CHITCHAT
I hope more people kind of realize that so that they can kind of more.	CHITCHAT
They can enjoy art.	CHITCHAT
OK, 'cause I think a lot of us have lost the concept of enjoying art.	CHITCHAT
Are isn't about trying to get Instagram followers or trying to make money or isn't trying to be like you know, sometimes art is about being fun.	CHITCHAT
Is having fun and not trying to be the best there is ever.	CHITCHAT
How do I get there?	CHITCHAT
I also have a dislike for the word talent.	CHITCHAT
Talent is overrated, but what about finding what you're going to finding your eyelids is all about experimentation.	CHITCHAT
As dabbling your pen into different things, you are a person has 24 hours within a day.	CHITCHAT
8 hours of that is sleeping.	CHITCHAT
So technically, 16 hours.	CHITCHAT
Well, I slide 97, so you basically have 17 hours to find out whatever the you want to do.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, sorry be heads potty mouth and go Yeah, 17 hours to figure out what you want to do.	CHITCHAT
Right so.	CHITCHAT
You know the experiment do different things, but trying try penciled, you know, tried digital, try painting.	CHITCHAT
You have so much like you have so much access.	CHITCHAT
Two starting settings.	CHITCHAT
Unlike 20 years ago where you had to take a class 'cause there was no, there was no Instagram.	CHITCHAT
There was no YouTube.	CHITCHAT
There was no wiki house.	CHITCHAT
There was no like skillshares.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Hi I just have a question about unaccurate perspective when doing freehand or is it ever concerned are mostly disabled for me?	CHITCHAT
I I build a shed everything earlier though shared and saw me using like the circle tool, but even that I kind of freehanded it.	O
It's all about like the M product.	O
If your intent is for it to be symmetrical and all this other stuff, and that's when you use it, but if you're just making something eyeballing for the most part that works.	O
Like this and this right here is a personal project.	O
I'm not selling it to anybody.	O
I'm just making something like.	O
There.	O
Instead, I bought I'm sad.	O
If I show this to somebody and then I know ones going around with a ruler, checking if, like everything symmetric, color everything circular.	O
That's just how I think of it.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
But she can pay for it, though better take out those.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Where they got those trace in circles and all his agitato.	O
It is for an ad agency or something like that.	O
Do you think someone is checking to see if it's running properly, yes.	O
I think that there there would be more eyes on it, not necessarily going like.	O
OK, so we all have an innate skill like.	O
So going back to talent.	O
Everyone has an eye for art.	O
Rather weather people admit it or not.	O
If I hung a painting and it was Krooked.	O
I don't need to need a roller in order to judge that is cricket or not.	O
If I look at a drawing and I go like.	O
Wow.	O
That left eye is higher than the right eye.	O
I don't need a ruler to kind of figure that out, and I think everybody can do that.	O
If I showed something to my mom and like take a look at the two issues.	O
Probably, though, like all the wise, that hand bigger than the other hand and just like vastly like if it's drastically like you know, apparent like everybody has that sort of like visual sort of thing that makes him feel like, Oh, I notice I notice something you know.	O

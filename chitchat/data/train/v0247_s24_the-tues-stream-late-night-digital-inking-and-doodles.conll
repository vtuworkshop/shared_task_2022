So because of that.	CHITCHAT
If you make something for a company and you show it to a bunch of feeble, like if you show it in 10 people, I'm pretty sure an one and something is asymmetrical about it.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
I think the 9th person persons pointed out and then that person will point it out to the other like nine people.	CHITCHAT
And then I'll go like, Oh, you're right.	CHITCHAT
And then that's when you get the callback or the email they like a without.	CHITCHAT
I want my money back so yeah, in that case that's when you start being more professional about your work.	CHITCHAT
Love is for your homie and it's like you know.	CHITCHAT
I made you a teddy bear, you know, with some school, let me choose teddy bear holding like a broadsword and so then you know you meet emailed over.	CHITCHAT
He's not going to check, he's just going to be like, yeah, that's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Pretty awesome.	CHITCHAT
So it's all about the intent of the project.	O
Or you can also think about it this way.	O
If your intent is to be a graphic designer.	O
Everything you do should be symmetrical 'cause you want to have that sort of mindset.	O
That sort of practice like everything I want to accomplish everything at once.	O
It has to be out in a certain standard.	O
'cause like when you put your workout there.	O
You're basically like saying This is who I am like.	O
Your Instagram is a representation of your right mind is all over the place, and The thing is, I don't take mine too.	O
I don't put too much weight into my Instagram.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
But a lot of people do for branding reasons so.	CHITCHAT
In that sense.	CHITCHAT
I say, like you're going to start.	CHITCHAT
Start now.	CHITCHAT
Bert being meticulous much work.	CHITCHAT
There's nothing wrong with that.	CHITCHAT
Now it's all about intent.	CHITCHAT
I'm I'm very much all about intent.	CHITCHAT
Like why are you doing the things that you're doing?	CHITCHAT
For me, I draw stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm not using this I'm not using like.	CHITCHAT
Met symmetry or not?	CHITCHAT
'cause like that's just account doing it 'cause I got not really putting.	CHITCHAT
Too much stock into just personal stuff, right so?	CHITCHAT
If it's Commission, that's when I kind of tighten it up, you know.	CHITCHAT
Long winded answer, I know, I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry I talk alot.	CHITCHAT
But Steve love than God.	CHITCHAT

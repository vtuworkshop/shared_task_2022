Yeah, it's up for interpretation, but dreaming of objects is one way to.	O
Tell your audience.	CHITCHAT
That that's what you want them to pay attention to.	CHITCHAT
And that's a tool that artists use in order to emphasize things.	O
So let's say that they were clouds.	O
Now you got your Godzilla right here, right?	O
I could've frame Godzilla by making clouds around him.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
And then the clouds.	O
Kind of like.	O
Lead to the dudes so that your eye travels naturally like you're kind of making a road to the Godzilla using objects around.	O
You know the scene, right?	O
Also the direction of.	O
The direction of the characters also can help.	O
Guide the viewers I so let's say that this dude.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Is looking this way.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Without telling anybody anything of my art piece, right?	O
I already set up a sort of story.	O
It's like this guy is like happy and he's unaware that a big scandal is behind him.	O
And like is probably going to eat him.	O
I don't have to write a caption right?	O
I don't have to write anything.	O
You automatically get that.	O
By just looking at this picture right and it's because like he's looking this way away from the Godzilla.	O
That's like, Oh OK, this is like kind of comical, OK?	O
But Have I change direction?	O
Of the character.	O
Going this way.	O
Then the narrative changes that the Godzilla is what's important, OK?	O
When you are.	O
Putting characters, especially people.	O
People, animals or whatever the direction that they're looking at.	O
The viewer will naturally.	O
Wonder what is that person?	O
What is that person looking at?	O
If you have characters looking at all different directions.	O
Sometimes that confuses the viewer.	O
Or like why are so many people looking at so many different directions and less?	O
You make a focal point character and then they're looking at something.	O
Then our eyes will naturally go like OK.	O
So what is this person?	O
Looking at we become inquisitive.	O
So next time you like, you set up a composition, think about stuff like that.	O
Think about intention.	O
Think about like what is the most important thing in this drawing, right?	O
Now this is a perfect example.	O
Right here.	CHITCHAT
He got.	CHITCHAT
Let's race all this You got.	O
Right here you are making a narrative.	O
You have your main character, main character, person down here.	O
And you have your spaceship up here, right?	O
Just making a rough spaceship thingy.	O
Again, composition and you kind of you kind of have it like you have sort of a thing going on right here.	O
I don't know if that was intentional or not.	O
A lot of times we pick up.	O
Different things that we've seen.	O
And then when we create something, we unconsciously include them because it's like, oh, I liked how they did that.	O
I'm going to put it in mind even though we don't actually say it.	O
We just kind of do it.	O
So probably you've seen this done before.	O
Where right here?	CHITCHAT
Where can you see my cursor?	O
You should look at you go.	O
Where right here like see you have this going up and it kind of dips down where your character is.	O
That line.	CHITCHAT
That line right there?	O
See how you have it like going three or four times that line.	O
Go straight to your character.	O
That means that this is character is important.	O

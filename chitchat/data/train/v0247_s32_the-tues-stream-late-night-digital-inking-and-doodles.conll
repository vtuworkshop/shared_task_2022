This character part what throws me off is right here.	O
What's that?	CHITCHAT
Have a like another spacecraft right here.	O
It is kind of odd.	O
Because.	CHITCHAT
Exit sort of like an incomplete sort of thing.	O
I get to ask him.	O
It's kind of unintentional.	O
Yeah, kind of throws me off because there's two ships and it becomes like.	O
Like this side heavy.	O
Like a left side heavy 'cause you have.	O
This thing right here, this dude right here.	O
This ship right here.	O
Anna nothing going on here.	O
Right, and like you kind of want to know if you wanted to balance things out.	O
Like I would have probably added another ship right here.	O
Make it look like they were following each other and he's looking up at like a ship formation or whatnot.	O
You know I didn't couple other ships that would probably make sense for added like a moon or something.	O
It kinda like build that kind of space.	O
Again, using shapes.	O
Building the form that's very important.	O
Building the form.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people do that.	O
He should.	O
I like value.	O
You followed my advice.	CHITCHAT
Good job Camden.	CHITCHAT
And then your last piece, which is this?	O
That's fun, that's actually cool.	CHITCHAT
And allows intentional or not.	O
I probably would have Adsense added something here you know like about.	O
You know how I talked about framing?	O
Like you got, you got your.	O
Cool ship looking thing and then the lights and what not right here and then you have some purple right here.	O
Got some purple definitely down here right?	O
I would probably think the purple down here and then that way.	O
Like these edges frame it so that this is important.	O
That's how that's what I would have like to seen.	O
But again, I like this, don't you?	CHITCHAT
Don't you feel so much freer?	O
Don't you feel like?	CHITCHAT
Less restrictive and you're just like I'm just making shapes and I'm just seeing what happens.	O
That's what I like to see.	O
Yeah, I was actually thinking about adding something there and then it moved in.	O
You moved out, hey, you know what?	O
That's fine again.	CHITCHAT
Like I was saying yesterday, it doesn't have to be perfect.	O
You could you could start on something and then like be really into it, get bored of it, save it, come back to it later or not.	O
Maybe this might inspire you to do something else later on, right?	O
Never delete your work.	O
Never.	CHITCHAT
It's fun for sure.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, see I told you.	CHITCHAT
Telogia though.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's not like.	CHITCHAT
People people get too caught up with details.	O
People get too caught up with like the line and trying to be so precise and not just.	O
Be messy with that, you know.	O
Be messy with the junk.	O
No man ain't nothing wrong with that.	O
They, even though I'm like Super, I'm super precise with us I I'm actually being very, very loose about love it.	O
Thank you for the great your walk and then you're doing great.	O
You're doing great my dude.	O
If I'm going, but I'm making make funky shapes you never know.	O
Make big shapes and then you know.	O
Afterwards go in the little shapes in there.	O
See what happens.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Never know.	CHITCHAT
Fun with that.	CHITCHAT
And like I'm going to have fun with wow after I stop streaming anyway.	CHITCHAT
We have about 15 minutes on stream, so if anyone else has any like questions or what not just let me know.	CHITCHAT
I am more than happy to like critique or give advice.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
He doesn't have to be about art broke up with your significant other hey.	CHITCHAT

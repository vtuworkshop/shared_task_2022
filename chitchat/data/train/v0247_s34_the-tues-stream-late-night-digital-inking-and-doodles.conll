That's why I don't like to throw around calling in regards to me.	CHITCHAT

No, all this in.	O
Turn the stones are gonna be a little more precise.	O
Now, here's a here's a good.	CHITCHAT
Topic comparison considering we're talking about professional or getting paid for art, let me last me like when should I start charging people for original Manish?	CHITCHAT
When should I start asking are doing commissions?	CHITCHAT
I say.	CHITCHAT
As soon as possible.	CHITCHAT
And then some people will tell me like, Oh my stuff isn't good enough and.	CHITCHAT
You know I need more time.	CHITCHAT
I'm like no.	CHITCHAT
No no no no no here the thing.	CHITCHAT
Arts is a skill.	CHITCHAT
Art is a thing that people.	CHITCHAT
Number that a lot of people.	CHITCHAT
Are unable to do.	CHITCHAT
Michael is a skill that not a lot of people can do right.	CHITCHAT
It's not necessarily about getting better is about finding your audience.	CHITCHAT
You have to find an audience that appreciates your work.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Then that's the hard part.	CHITCHAT
The heart part.	CHITCHAT
Yes, that's a very that's hard as well, but the even harder part has trying to find an audience that as willing to contribute to the things that you do.	CHITCHAT
That's why I think streaming is a great way to get her out there.	CHITCHAT
The shows people like, hey, this is what I can do and it shows your personality.	CHITCHAT
If people can see the artist Anne know what they're about and see if there are good person or not.	CHITCHAT
Make some more invested.	CHITCHAT
As a consumer.	CHITCHAT
And there's like stories behind the art that that person does.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
That's my conventions.	CHITCHAT
Like artist Alyzza Dayton there.	CHITCHAT
I think artists alleys are great.	CHITCHAT
'cause you get to the meet the artist that you been watching on Instagram or so long.	CHITCHAT
I have Camden came to me ankamma was like oh.	CHITCHAT
And I started doing commissions.	CHITCHAT
I'm like, yeah, sure, just he had to find your audience.	CHITCHAT
I never started getting paid for money or I never started getting paid for my art until I started screaming.	CHITCHAT
'cause it is hard.	CHITCHAT
Hillard has really, really hard without before social media it was freaking hard as hell.	CHITCHAT
To find clients.	CHITCHAT
It was like word of mouth or you've got published in a magazine or something like that.	CHITCHAT
So all you kids better be grateful for the intro webs.	CHITCHAT

What was the word I'm looking for?	CHITCHAT
Color roughs, there we go.	O
For all that to sell with, like maybe if if you bought the bundle of like the first wave like all of it, I don't know.	O
This is going to be a.	CHITCHAT
Is this going to be a Kickstarter thing?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I need to start a mailing list if I'm going to do a Kickstarter.	CHITCHAT
For these guys to be printed that way.	CHITCHAT
Jeremy asked, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So are you creating this basket?	CHITCHAT
It's just to do it.	CHITCHAT
And then he adds that Hood and orange color sounds really cool.	CHITCHAT
Thanks man.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I kind of wanted to have like bold colors.	CHITCHAT
So I.	CHITCHAT
There goes, there goes the speech again for chef, I'm sorry man.	CHITCHAT
Um you follow any work, you'll know that I have this thing called the studies.	CHITCHAT
Where it's pretty much done tonight, right now they're like bees.	CHITCHAT
You know there they got the infant proportions with the giant head small bodies.	CHITCHAT
But they have long arms and they have like full anatomy and stuff and like like their muscular, if they're superheroes or whatever.	CHITCHAT
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
Most of them have been fan art and I love them.	CHITCHAT
I think they're great, but I really want to get into like 3D printing and 3D printing figures in Little Collectables and stuff.	CHITCHAT
And until such a time that I actually get like a license to do that.	CHITCHAT
I can operate in a bit of a Gray area.	CHITCHAT
But it's not something that I really want to do forever, so I just started developing original studies.	CHITCHAT
Um, for?	CHITCHAT
For the sake of, uh.	CHITCHAT
Having something to like.	CHITCHAT
Be able to just sell without any any kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Fear of like Oh Man, I hope this.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't attract too much attention and gets me in trouble or or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
So I've decided to make these original ones.	CHITCHAT
Just so that.	CHITCHAT
So that there is I have.	CHITCHAT
A product to be able to to like, sell for myself really.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
This particular.	CHITCHAT
Set that I'm doing right now is just like futuristic neo ninjas, but with classic traditional.	CHITCHAT
Mass, you know?	CHITCHAT
Making the book first can help fund the figures and build up excitement for him.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it could also even be the cheapest.	CHITCHAT
Start up right.	CHITCHAT
Yes, that's an idea to think about.	CHITCHAT
There are terrible.	CHITCHAT
Thanks chipanga.	CHITCHAT
Need more printings?	CHITCHAT
Yeah for sure.	CHITCHAT
I've got two.	CHITCHAT
I've got a.	CHITCHAT
I've got one that's here and another one that's pending delivery, 'cause it was a pre order.	CHITCHAT
You know what I'm talking about?	CHITCHAT
And that's going to be.	CHITCHAT
Helpful in making my bigger ones.	CHITCHAT
Or more at the same time.	CHITCHAT
So that's cool.	CHITCHAT
As you create all your artwork in Photoshop solely, or do you design your multiple applications?	CHITCHAT
I do mostly photo shop like 90% of it is photo shop.	CHITCHAT
I didn't use to draw in Photoshop.	CHITCHAT
I used to just draw by hand, uhm?	CHITCHAT
But that's kind of.	CHITCHAT
Cumbersome, so I'm trying to switch over to more.	CHITCHAT
More of a.	CHITCHAT
More Digital Lineart and stuff.	CHITCHAT
And this is one of my.	CHITCHAT
This is one of things that I'm trying to like develop more.	CHITCHAT
Just being able to do more digital work as far as a drawing.	CHITCHAT
My painting is pretty much 100% done in photo shop.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, the drawing in Photoshop is kind of knew, but I'm really enjoying it and there's a lot of tricks you can do.	CHITCHAT

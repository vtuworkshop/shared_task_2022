But I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, alright so.	CHITCHAT
I think I think we did pretty good here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to delete this sword because it is a travesty and I don't like it.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Go away, turn off symmetry.	O
Hey, now we know that makes a glitch here.	O
We don't turn it up.	O
We're going to put him.	O
I'm going to put a #7 on that sword shield thing at some point, but.	O
It's not bad guys.	O
We did pretty good I like it.	O
Gonna get rid of that.	O
I do have to ask, is it better that it's simpler, like almost empty, or do we like all the little greevil types?	O
Type of thing.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'll find out in the future, but.	O
I like it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to call it weapon.	O
Weapons 7 the whole thing.	O
Everything is going to have a cool name.	O
But I like it.	CHITCHAT
Wolf Ridge Answer.	O
Oh yeah, and then and then for sure, this is going to be like.	O
I have Continues not selected.	O
To do a very quick mark up, but.	O
Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
Not that quick maybe.	O
But this thing is going to be like.	O
It's going to be like this.	O
Big might even go wider, right?	O
Yeah, so it'll be that freaking huge.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be so freaking cool.	CHITCHAT

It's a giant key that unlocks your life, wow, but I think it's more like it unlocks your death, right?	CHITCHAT

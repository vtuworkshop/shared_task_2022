Well thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm very flattered and a hashtag media offline for the win FTW.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
That's a running gag by the way, for anybody that's in, uh, watching these episodes, I am I can actually segue into one of my regular things I do during these live streams now.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, so one thing I like to do for anybody that's not familiar, I like to show off dresses that I've designed in the past, and I'm actually wearing a tunic top with Beatles anthology 2 on it.	O
And this was meant to be more of a casual sort of.	O
Loungey design just to sort of where volume working around the house.	O
Um, if it's especially warm like it was today, it definitely works, uh?	O
You know, just for relaxing and just trying to get through the hot summer day, things like that.	CHITCHAT
But one of the running gags is.	CHITCHAT
One of the dresses I designed was a dress around the media, offline uhm?	O
Message in premiere pro, which is on a red screen.	O
Actually hold on a second.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
So this is about the IT would help if you can actually see it.	CHITCHAT
So that's actually the back of it so.	O
I made this as a gag.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you all can see that, but it's got the media offline message in all of the different languages.	O
I had to go through and recreate it myself because funny enough, the actual graphic inside of Premier Rasterizes beyond 1080.	O
So I had to in order for it to be legible on fabric.	O
It had to be a very high resolution so I had to sort of recreate the graphic from scratch.	O
You know, using the actual colors that are represented and.	O
But I was I was that was honestly done on a dare because I had posted a picture of the other Adobe dress that I had made around the.	O
Um, the logos in the creative suite.	O
So this one.	CHITCHAT
This is actually the first one I wore during these live streams on camera, so I went through and I did research on all of the different logos featured in the creative suite over the years.	O
Rudy from flash to fireworks to everything you know, arranging them.	O
Uh, based around what color they are, and, um, making a design around that, and I wanted to do that for quite some time and it just it just so happened that it worked beautifully with timing, because the year that I made that dress, I was going to Adobe Max 2019 and so I got to where that Ann, the media offline dress.	O
2 Adobe Max and that was a wonderful experience anyway, so that's what he's referring to when he mentions media offline.	O
How do you like staying home?	CHITCHAT
Feeling blue yet?	CHITCHAT
But you guys can't see it, but he left the.	CHITCHAT
This is also a running gag.	CHITCHAT
He left the some of the lyrics for that song by.	CHITCHAT
I want to say it was it's Eiffel 65.	CHITCHAT
Eiffel 65.	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty sure that's the name of the band anyway.	CHITCHAT
It's one of those songs from the 90s that reminds me of the roller rink.	CHITCHAT
Um, I'm pretty OK with us staying home.	CHITCHAT
I've been mostly just, um, juggling projects back and forth, including this one, so I know other people miss going out and meet miss being out and about.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
There are times that I do miss going out, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
In the grand scheme of things, I'd rather wait until it some.	CHITCHAT
Until it's safe for two.	CHITCHAT
Eiffel 65 yeah, I was right DJ.	CHITCHAT
Just qualified that.	CHITCHAT
Now Adobe hasn't infamous bug bit campy flush.	CHITCHAT
I'm guessing you're referring to the media offline graphic.	CHITCHAT
At least.	CHITCHAT
I believe so.	CHITCHAT
I mean I, uh, lucky for me, I'm just going to knock on wood real quick here.	CHITCHAT

Um, I've had pretty good luck with the Adobe suite, particularly dynamic link, so, uh.	O
I'm pretty happy with how it functions at the moment.	O
I know other people have different stories, but, uh?	O
It all has to do with different computing powers and.	O
You know how people maintain their computers too?	O
They all run differently.	O
Not every computer is created equal.	O
You know, it all depends on the set up, how it scared, for how it's arranged, what kind of processing power it has, those you factor into the computing power of certain programs, especially stealthy ones like after effects.	O
Now I use after effects daily almost daily, so I, uh.	O
To make sure that it runs smoothly as much as possible, especially with that program.	O
I mean, in premiere pro, I mean in premiere pro, I'm guessing you're referring to the media offline graphic then, which it's funny.	O
I always thought you know there were times that I thought it was funny.	O
And other times that it was frustrating.	O
But overall it was just kind of.	O
It came off as comical to Maine.	O
Because you know somebody else is just pulling hair out looking at that graphic.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, so.	CHITCHAT
You called me while I was in the middle of creating um nulls following the drumsticks.	O
I'm not doing a pick up right now.	O
For anybody that's just tuning in, that means I I went back to an earlier clip featured in one of the first couple of episodes.	CHITCHAT
And I'm doing things to see if I can't.	CHITCHAT
Push the design so little bit further.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK, this one is definitely trickier.	O
Let me see if I can't break the tangents here.	O
So what's on the menu?	CHITCHAT
What are you going to teach us?	CHITCHAT
Can't wait to see it, so you'll see.	CHITCHAT
You'll see I'm making the nose right now so I can show that process.	O
Essentially I'm making.	O
Uh, motion track nulls for the drumstick drumsticks specifically so I can create trails offset drumsticks.	O
I was also revising um animations that show up on the drum kit In addition.	O
So I'm basically going through an revising what I visually have right now and boosting it just a little bit further.	O
That's why it's called pick up.	O
Least I call it a pick up.	O
I don't know everybody the other people can call a different things, but I refer to it as a pick up.	O
Let's see.	O
Where is it go?	CHITCHAT
Where did he go?	CHITCHAT
So I've been marathoning the first three seasons of Arrested Development.	CHITCHAT
I just the writing on that show is so brilliant and I love Ron Howards Marijane itself.	CHITCHAT
There's definitely an omnipotent.	CHITCHAT
I love the omnipotent narration throughout the whole shell, but I love that there's always sense of sarcasm all the way through with an aeration.	CHITCHAT
Because it's Ron Howard.	CHITCHAT
For a second, I thought you met a chicken drumstick and I was like, wait is Natalie?	CHITCHAT
I just seen that rotating is not only rotating food.	CHITCHAT
Well, if I had a rotisserie and I could most attractive.	CHITCHAT

That rotisserie maybe.	CHITCHAT
No, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
But uh.	CHITCHAT
That's funny, that's funny that you the first thought was it's funny when you mention that I was reminded of a shell.	CHITCHAT
So a Shel Silverstein poem from a million years ago.	CHITCHAT
I can't remember from what book I want to say.	CHITCHAT
It was falling up, but the title was, uhm, I want to say the title was Turkey and it had an illustration of a guy with a drumstick in his throat.	CHITCHAT
Just looking at the looking at the viewer, all confused.	CHITCHAT
And the poem basically described that this guy swallowed a drumstick and the drummer was really angry at him for swallowing the drumstick.	CHITCHAT
I loved falling up.	CHITCHAT
This is my favorite poem books.	CHITCHAT
Illustrations of fun too.	CHITCHAT
OK, so it's gone below at that point.	O
Oh wait, no did it right there.	CHITCHAT
But OK, well then.	CHITCHAT
That means I can move that up here.	O
There's a good all autosave.	O
Let's see, can I break that tangent?	O
Yes, I can great.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let me see.	CHITCHAT
Is it easier to do short custom intros and after effects rather than doing the entire sequence for faster rendering slash export even with all those third party plugins?	O
Well, I have a general practice.	O
It's always easier if you've got a large scale project too.	O
Export out a little bit at a time, at least to a high quality codec.	O
An format and resolution.	O
To be placed and timed with audio.	O
For some larger projects that you would have to do.	O
That's always a general rule.	O
Uhm?	CHITCHAT
It cuts down on render times for one.	O
The only thing is if you need to make revisions to any color effects, Annie.	O
Um compositing effects such as glow or chromatic aberration or anything textural, you will have to re render that clip again so.	O
It is easier by far, but it does have its own limitations, but really both have their own limitations.	O
It's just a matter of What is more.	O
What is easier with your?	O
Production schedule and your process.	O
You know what flows better with you.	O
In terms of how you create and you might want to go from that point on, so deciding whether you want to do it in advance or later on.	O
You know, I've done it both ways.	O
Depending on the project, so it's really up to the demands of the project itself.	O
And that should dictate it for you.	O
I hope that answers your question.	CHITCHAT

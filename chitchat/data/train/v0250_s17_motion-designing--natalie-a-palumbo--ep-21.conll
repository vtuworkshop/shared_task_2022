But for something like this, especially since I'm doing pickups, it's far easier just to go back and um.	O
Just let it render for a longer time off of the aftereffects comp and show the actual comp in the timeline, which for this computer it's.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's a work station so it can handle it for one.	O
But But for the demands of the live streams, and especially the project in particular, and the fact I'm doing pickups anyway, it's better to just have it represented in the timeline and revised in real time as I go.	O
But your computer might be different, and it might not be able to handle aftereffects comps in a timeline situation, in which case you might want to render out precomposed clips, and that's fine.	O
Either Way is fine, it's just knowing how to do it properly either way.	O
And going from there.	O
Now, As for third party plugins, you're always going to want to keep those local.	O
It's kind of impossible to render a project.	O
No, send it off somewhere else.	O
2.	O
Another computer that may not have the same plugin on that machine.	O
It may not show up the same way.	O
You know some some of some of the third party plugins like the red giant plugins.	O
If you're not.	CHITCHAT
If you're not registered, it'll show up as either a red or green X so.	O
You wanna make sure to avoid that as much as possible.	O
By the way, that collection of Plugins as well worth it.	O
I use them all the time.	CHITCHAT
Came's going to take a look.	CHITCHAT
But it it It Is It.	CHITCHAT
Anthony, you drum too fast.	CHITCHAT
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Um, that's right.	CHITCHAT
I made a huge mistake.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kidding.	CHITCHAT
This is an easy fix.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK, so that's one.	CHITCHAT
It would help if I am OK.	CHITCHAT
806.5 eight 55.5.	O
Play.	O
806 I don't know what I said before.	O
Yep, Yep it did I found privacy under 2 minutes, renders us X export faster than 15 minutes.	O
Do any do you have any tricks to utilize all the ram GPU?	O
Power and after effects is mine says 6070% but I want to use 90.	O
Well, I know there's a function within preferences where you can actually establish where the ram goes like.	O
Let's say you have more than one program open in the Adobe Suite, but you want to reserve more for one program over the rest of them.	O
So like let's say for instance I have.	O
Give are take like let's say I'm working with 32 gigabytes of ram on this machine.	O
Not that I am, but it's just an example.	O
You can reserve.	O

Any number within the gigabytes of Ram.	O
Just for after effects or whatever program you have opened and vice versa.	O
And then reserve however many other gigabytes for the other programs you have opened.	O
So let's say you have photo shop and.	O
I don't know illustrator open for whatever reason.	O
Let's say you said it too.	CHITCHAT
What's a good number?	O
32 - 5.	O
27 let's say you want to reserve 27 gigabytes of ram just for after effects, but you want to reserve 5 for the remaining programs.	O
There is a way to do that if you go under preferences.	O
I want I want to say.	CHITCHAT
Let me let me take a look.	CHITCHAT
It's some.	CHITCHAT
It's under the memory tab.	O
Now that's according to my little Mac book.	O
It could be different depending on what machine you're using, but there is a function.	O
Um, to establish what ram is prioritized for what program?	O
Yo face on what you have open and what you're working on.	O
So if you wanna use more ram to the project.	O
You can definitely.	CHITCHAT
Established that I've done it many times.	O
Having more ram in the 1st place for projects, projects like this is always a good thing anyway, so general rule of practice.	O
But, uh.	CHITCHAT
Oh, did I just do something?	CHITCHAT
OK, Good No.	CHITCHAT
Accidentally all clicked this and I did not mean to.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Position 806.5 eight 55.5.	O
So based on what you're talking about in terms of percentages.	O
You could probably use up all the ram for one program, but the general rule I would find.	O
Is keep as.	O
Keep only the programs open that you need to quote.	O
Spaceballs, take only what you need to survive.	O
And if it means using the industrial strength Hair Dryer.	O
Then use it.	O
You want this Hunter machine.	O
You carry it.	O
All right now, is the emitter still on screen?	O
Why is it all the way down there?	O
Not supposed to be down there.	O
OK, it's parented to the right one.	O
I think I know what I need to do.	O
Might get a machine that can support one terabyte.	O
Adobe is like a BMW.	O
I understand what you mean by that it some.	O
It definitely requires a lot of computing power.	O
For some, some of the programs, but the output is stellar, you know.	O
So there definitely is a reason for it and you can control the amount of.	O
Ram that is being used so.	O
I will see that there is a little more versatility with the Adobe suite that I found.	O
What I do like is when there is like, let's say, the computer, let's say the program crashes.	O
There is an attempt to recover the file, so it's not completely lost whether it be in auto saves or a crash report or recovery file.	O
That is one thing I can say about working in after effects.	O
That's, uh.	CHITCHAT
Just amazing is that that's in place at all.	O
Somebody thought to put that in there.	O
I'll tell you what it did, uh?	O
It did help in certain circumstances to have that in place so.	O
Let's see if this works.	CHITCHAT
That's the trick.	CHITCHAT

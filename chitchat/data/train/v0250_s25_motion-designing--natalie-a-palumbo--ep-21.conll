Trying to remember exactly what it was.	O
That's right, right?	CHITCHAT
I was gonna motion track the trails to the footage.	O
So the null created from the handheld motion of the footage.	O
For those of you wondering, all of the footage that was used in the timeline is actually mine, and it was all hand held at different venues.	O
So literally, I'm moving around the room, getting footage of the vans at different angles, capturing different things.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And the one thing I always made sure of though, is I wanted to make sure that each band member was represented equally.	O
They don't like here, you know.	O
'cause the focus is on.	O
Anthony's drumming at this point in the song anyway, so of course.	O
I was going to feature that with the animation.	O
Now we shouldn't have to worry about it cutting off considering it's within the composition.	O
Itself.	O
But we'll see.	O
Oh my bad.	CHITCHAT
I should have motion tracked in the beginning.	O
Then why is it sliding off and less?	O
Is that just a consequence of?	O
You know in earnest.	O
Normally I would say you need it, but in this case considering it follows the exact movement of the drumsticks, she almost don't.	O
But I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Let me take a look again 'cause they actually fold my eyes.	O
Yeah, this one's good to go.	O
I think sometimes the animation needs the motion track number be parented to be.	O
It needs to be parented to the motion track null in order for it to feel fluidly within the footage, but in this case it's following the drumstick movement so precisely.	O
You almost don't need to do that here.	O
Typically something I like to do, but in this case it might.	O
Break the movement instead of make the movement in a matter of speaking so.	O
I'm trying to decide if there's anything else I need to do the do to this clip.	O
I mean, if I think of anything, I can always come back to this at a later point, but I'm pretty happy with how this turned out.	O
I might Add a little more color to the footage itself.	O
Overall.	O
Just to give the footage a little more warmth.	O
Which is something I typically like to do.	O
Since you remove all of the color, the color values.	O
And that's part of the motif is minimal color.	O
Except for the animation, which mostly has a blue tone.	O
So let me take a look at what it is now.	O
Turn up this to 15.	O
This has to be ever so slight.	O
Yeah, I think that looks good.	CHITCHAT
The only thing I could think of that.	O
You know, in comparison to the current animation as it stands, it felt a little.	O
Desaturated So I wanted to create a sense of balance between the warm tones of the footage and the cool tones of the animation.	O
If I'm not mistaken, I think I already have chromatic aberration on the edge of edges of the footage.	O
Let me just go take a look and make sure though.	O
Yeah, no, it's right there.	CHITCHAT
It's right in front of me.	CHITCHAT
Um, it's usual settings.	CHITCHAT
Then I like to give it so.	CHITCHAT
Just make sure it's really there.	CHITCHAT
It's one of the things I started doing with all of the clips to give it a.	O

There, so this is one of the bigger problems when you can draw anything.	O
Because then you just.	O
Don't know what to draw, which is way worse.	O
I mean, I guess I could just kind of, you know why?	O
We're just going to kind of wing it today when I get it.	O
I'm not gonna overthink it, but when you overthink it, that's usually when you get you.	O
You get demotivated, uses kind of, go with it or whatever.	O
I guess I'll just start off with.	O
Withdrawing bats and then kind of go over there.	O
I need that S eat anyways.	O
And you can see what we can do, what we can do with that.	O
If you give me a quick second.	O
I will.	CHITCHAT
See if I can find some pretty good references for bats, as I've always instructed.	O
If you've ever if you ever ever do any kind of practicing and stuff like that, you should always have reference.	O
You know, a lot of people will tell you.	O
Don't use reference.	O
Reference or anything like that is cheating and all that, and I'm like dude.	O
Like if people tell you that, don't listen.	O
You need reference when you're practicing and you'll get to a certain point where you may not have to use reference, but it is key and essential to you.	O
Learning and getting better.	O
At what you do I want to Oh my God, I also want to draw this new character, but I just I OK so I want to draw this new character for my comic.	O
But I kinda don't necessarily know how I want to go about it.	O
Um, the character is going to be a frog, his name is going to be handsome the frog.	O
But I don't necessarily know how I want to go about drawing the character.	O
I had a good idea, but I kinda like procrastinated on it, so I never really got around to doing it.	O
Eventually I'm gonna have to.	O
Draw it so I can put it on 'cause I wanna make a mouse pad of all of the characters that I've drawn and stuff like that.	O
Alright, let me see if I can find it.	O
Let me see if I can find.	CHITCHAT
Good bad reference.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
My God.	CHITCHAT
People really don't.	CHITCHAT
One of the main reasons why I make my own testes is because I learn.	O
Early on that people really don't.	O
Like the style in which they draw for tattooing and stuff like that, I just I just.	O
I'm not really a fan.	O
Of the way that most people just portray the same style, it's it's a notable style.	O
But it's like the same thing.	O
Is very rarely to ever see anything that's like out of the ordinary.	O
Or new?	CHITCHAT
Well, I guess that's why.	CHITCHAT
I guess that's why people like us exist so we can do something new.	O
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Looking for reference.	CHITCHAT
I swear I had it.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
And how's everyone else doing today?	CHITCHAT
With those you guys that are just tuning in, probably I'm more I'm about to start a new test sheet for bats.	CHITCHAT
So I'm basically just looking for.	O
Like reference To help me once I get started, everything else is pretty much easier, just flows very well, but the hard part is just getting started.	O
What's up?	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to think.	CHITCHAT
So generally what I tell people to do?	CHITCHAT

When they start doing references, make sure you have like realistic.	O
Reference and then have a reference of your favorite artists.	O
Work doesn't necessarily have to be what you're drawing, but have like some kind of reference of what your favorite artist does so you can.	O
Kind of had the inspiration of style in which you're going for and then you just get kind of like a either realistic or whatever kind of style you're going.	O
For me, I prefer realistic are real real images of whatever I'm going to draw, because that way I at least I know what I'm drawing and I can stylize it however I want so.	O
But The thing is, is most of the most of the images I'm saying now I just bats in the dark, and that's not going to work.	O
I need.	CHITCHAT
Forward air at weird angles.	O
I'm looking for what it's at.	O
A good front view angle so I can so I can make sure I get that position and then I can.	O
I can.	CHITCHAT
Do my turn around.	O
Generally when I first started test sheet on the left hand or right hand side of the test sheet, it usually has all the things that will give me trouble.	O
When I draw said test sheet and then the right side are then yeah it was in the right side of the test.	O
She will be me.	O
Basically drawing poses and things like that.	O
Crap.	CHITCHAT
I really should be more prepared.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I swear I had pictures of bats.	O
Hold on.	CHITCHAT
My goddess.	CHITCHAT
Oh All right?	CHITCHAT
Do do do do do do, do do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do do.	CHITCHAT
You know it sucks is whenever you start something like this.	CHITCHAT
I know this is going to be one of those situations where I'm going to start drawing and then as soon as I get done and get bored with it or whatever, then I'm going to find what I was actually looking for.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
I'm rather annoyed with this.	CHITCHAT
Uh, we don't even want to draw bath right now.	O
See, this is the part that you guys don't see.	CHITCHAT
This is really good 'cause.	CHITCHAT
A lot of my day starts off like this where I'm just kind of like Oh my God, what do I want to draw?	CHITCHAT
do I even really want to practice this?	CHITCHAT
I have to get something on paper before I can actually be like, Alright, we're ready.	CHITCHAT
Or I'll just sit here and I'll just constantly contemplate whether or not I want to do it.	CHITCHAT
Why you know why is this so hard?	CHITCHAT
You know, like I just, you know.	CHITCHAT
And then once I get going, it's like oh and I don't know why it took me so long.	CHITCHAT
All right, we're going to figure this out.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Bats bats video my God.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Ill that's a good picture, but Oh God it's not.	CHITCHAT

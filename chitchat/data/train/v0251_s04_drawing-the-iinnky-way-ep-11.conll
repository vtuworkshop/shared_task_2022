And upon drawing all the up on being asked to draw, beat up on being asked to draw all this weird stuff.	CHITCHAT
A lot of it I have to learn how to draw, so I do these test sheets.	CHITCHAT
That's where something that I knew I was going to end up having to learn how to do.	CHITCHAT
'cause I hadn't done it in forever.	CHITCHAT
And I figured I would get a jump on it, but I can.	CHITCHAT
Also I need to work on eyes from my book because it's part of what I wanted people to.	O
What I want to put in a book and kind of explain on how I do it.	O
Both of which.	CHITCHAT
I could do.	CHITCHAT
I also need to draw this freaking character.	O
Well, I have a sheet.	CHITCHAT
Thing is, I have a sheet.	O
That shows how I draw eyes.	O
But It's from a book and I don't.	O
I don't necessarily want it.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
They need to do hands.	O
I need to do I need to do.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Screw it?	CHITCHAT
Let's draw some eyes, shall we?	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So that I'm not sitting here all day thinking about stuff.	O
I think I zoomed in a bit much.	O
It's not going to work.	O
So how are you?	CHITCHAT
How are you guys today doing?	CHITCHAT
Hopefully it's going well.	CHITCHAT
They're trying to change my schedule at work again.	CHITCHAT
Just going to really anger me because every time they change my schedule it becomes permanent and they always they always tell you it's going to be temporary and then is always permanent.	CHITCHAT
I don't really want my schedule change.	CHITCHAT
OK, it's not going to work.	CHITCHAT
One of the things that I learned about drawing eyes that would that would.	O
That's like really a huge secret.	O
That's like not really huge secret, but a lot of people don't necessarily understand is like when they draw eyes, especially from from beauty.	O
Always try to make the eyes symmetrical.	O
And the key to drawing pretty cool eyes did not make him symmetrical.	O
Just kind of make him look symmetrical or feel symmetrical, you know.	O
But I notice a lot of people when they do eyes, they get frustrated expressing when their new because their eyes aren't like they draw them in there like Oh well, they're not.	O
They don't match their not symmetrical or not even in this like well, they're not necessarily supposed to be even, you know, even the human body isn't even.	O
It's slightly off.	O
So you try to tell them I don't try to make the eyes even, you know.	O
Instead try try to gather the.	O
Idea of it looking even but not being even, you know it helps you with speed drawing when you understand that it can be a little bit off, but you know.	O
Just it add quick glances should appear to be even.	O
Now when I draw, my female eyes always put like Ring running outside for the eye lashes or whatever.	O

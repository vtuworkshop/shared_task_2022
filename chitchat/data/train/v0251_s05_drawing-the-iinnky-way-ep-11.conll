I never draw separate eyelashes, I just simply because it's too much of a pain and I kind of like try to limit myself to the amount of pain I caused myself in my art work.	O
I just recently started doing like you know, like the lines for the bridge of the nose and stuff like that because before I used to just I would just draw the eyes and then draw the nose in the center with no bridge.	O
But then I realized it was a lot more.	O
It looked a lot more anime than I want it.	O
Right, so we can go with that.	CHITCHAT
I always try to do a turn around or like at least a front view in a side view before I actually start digging into whatever I'm going to do I might not even use any of these, but whenever I do test, she's always kind of try to have like something like that.	O
Kind of helps with the design, the overall design or what not.	O
Again, this is a lot of people find this kind of stuff boring, and it's kind of the reason why a lot of beginning artist struggle is because the the fun stuff that are the stuff that you would consider not fun is the stuff that actually helps you get better.	O
You don't necessarily have to make your study of of whatever you're doing.	O
Feel boring, it can feel like something that you actually want to do.	O
It can be fun.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't have to be something that you hate.	O
But I find that a lot of people Tend to.	O
Suck the joy out of learning things just simply because they attributed to what they used to do in school, where they everything they did was kind of like it was frustrating, and anything that had to do with learning was it was a pain in the butt and they never actually really learn how to have fun with art.	O
They just learned how to do whatever the teachers told them.	O
And whatever the teachers told them wasn't fun.	O
And it just kind of carried over to when they got older and then we would do art.	O
They would hate it.	O
But one of the things that I always try to get away from was that whole field that I had when I was an art class and the teacher would tell you to Draw Something.	O
And of course whatever he or she told you to draw was, it seemed like whatever they told you to draw didn't necessarily.	O
It never matched up with what you wanted to do.	O
Oops, hold on.	CHITCHAT
I forgot to do something.	CHITCHAT
I always do this.	CHITCHAT
It never.	CHITCHAT
It never matched up with what you wanted to do.	O
My biggest problem that I had in school is they like school didn't necessarily have a working curriculum for art.	O
It was borleske.	O
They just dumped you in a room with a bunch of people that had the same.	O
It's just basically took that same class for electives or whatever because it was easy credit and so you have people that didn't care about art at all.	O
And then you have people that were serious about art in the same classroom, all learning the same stuff.	O
And it didn't necessarily workout because you would want.	O
Like someone like me would really, really, really want to learn how to draw and get better.	O
But I'm lumped in a class of people that just wanted to get another credit and the teacher was basically trying to teach us all and it just.	O
It never seems to workout quite right because you know, when it was time to draw and do things you got they made.	O
I never really understood why in in in a drawing class they gave you hobby stuff like I talked about it a lot where my teacher would make us draw a hand turkeys.	CHITCHAT
It was something that I hate it around that time of year.	CHITCHAT
Where did they would basically make you take your hand and put it on a table and trace it and then turn it into a Turkey.	CHITCHAT
And it never actually taught me anything.	CHITCHAT
It just seemed like arts and crafts.	CHITCHAT
and I was like I wasn't, I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I didn't actually come to art class to craft.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to learn how to draw things in my teacher just didn't really care to teach me how to draw things.	CHITCHAT
You know they would or they would do the boring stuff that we all see today that we can't stand, which is like the.	CHITCHAT

They put the bowl of fruit in front of the light and then they make you sit there for however long the classes and try to draw that bowl of fruit under the light.	CHITCHAT
But they never actually taught you any fundamentals.	CHITCHAT
So what you're doing was basically frustrating yourself because you would sit there all class trying to get it to look as perfect as possible.	CHITCHAT
But all of the people that actually learned on their own were the ones that excelled at it.	CHITCHAT
Everybody else is kind of like whatever, and it was annoying as hell because.	CHITCHAT
You would get graded on it and it was like, well, I how was I suppose I didn't.	CHITCHAT
Even I know, I know.	CHITCHAT
Have I don't have any idea what I'm doing, you know.	CHITCHAT
And like the teachers, just kind of like would weed out the people that actually knew what they were doing and then left everybody else to their own devices.	CHITCHAT
I think the only time that we ever did anything cool in my art classes in high school was when we first got in the class and they gave us a folder and then.	CHITCHAT
They would tell us draw whatever you want on the folder and I would do that to gauge what kind of stuff you wanted to get into and our teachers always focused other people that would do like realism and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
They didn't seem to have any interest in anybody.	CHITCHAT
I did comics or cartoon type stuff, you know, or graffiti if you did anything that resembled any of that kind of stuff they try to shy you away from it and tried to lure you into a more.	CHITCHAT
Commercial.	CHITCHAT
Types like situation or scenario, whatever.	CHITCHAT
And their whole their whole thought process behind it was.	CHITCHAT
College isn't going to take someone that does like this kind of Art.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to go to college, you need to be doing something like this or that.	CHITCHAT
and I was just like.	CHITCHAT
I don't really want to go to college, I just want to make cool art.	CHITCHAT
You know, I was like I don't, you know, 'cause I was like I'm not getting a scholarship and I'm not paying to go to Art College 'cause I mean, I'm just I can't afford that.	CHITCHAT
So can you teach me how to draw teddy bears or cute things that I can you know, put in my love letters that I wrote to girls and stuff like that you know or can you teach me something that will actually make me a better artist so I can figure out how to do it on my own?	CHITCHAT
You know all I really wanted to do was in being I wanted to impress people when I was in high school I didn't really.	CHITCHAT
I didn't necessarily care too much about.	CHITCHAT
What I could have done with my future.	CHITCHAT
I was just like I want to impress people and this stuff that I'm doing right now is not impressive.	CHITCHAT
It's boring.	CHITCHAT
You know, it might impress the teacher, but I don't care about impressing the teacher, you know.	CHITCHAT
And then as I went on, I started realizing that.	CHITCHAT
A lot of the stuff that we were learning was a curriculum is what they basically what they made the teacher teach you.	CHITCHAT
You know, even if the teacher wanted to teach you something else they weren't allowed to, you know because they had to basically make sure everybody was learning the same thing.	CHITCHAT
So those people in your classroom or in my classroom that were actually better at art just suffered.	CHITCHAT
You know, they got grades, but they did not learn anything and that was the one thing that made a couple of my friends upset.	CHITCHAT
Because they were like it doesn't matter if we get good grades, were not learning anything.	CHITCHAT
Now with something that stuck with me through my entire Art Karere where it's like it doesn't matter.	CHITCHAT
The kind of grades that I get it doesn't matter, um.	CHITCHAT
It it doesn't.	CHITCHAT
It never.	CHITCHAT
It never seemed to matter to me.	CHITCHAT
How someone viewed.	CHITCHAT
Like like like my art as far as like you know grading it it only.	CHITCHAT
It only mattered if I learn what I wanted to learn so it got it.	CHITCHAT
Got it literally got to a point where I was like.	CHITCHAT
I honestly don't care.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
If I got good grades on my art and stuff like that, you know I just wanted to learn things and that was kind of what I was trying to take from it and it seemed like increasing it seemed increasingly harder to get.	CHITCHAT
Someone to actually teach me something that would be useful.	CHITCHAT
Most of the stuff that I learned was not things was not things that I wanted to learn or things that I wanted to use.	CHITCHAT
It was literally just what these people thought I should be doing.	CHITCHAT
You know which kind of frustrated you you know.	CHITCHAT
So basically you would would learn how to do things on your own.	CHITCHAT
And that was even more frustrating because back when I was younger we only had the library.	CHITCHAT
We have school and we had friends.	CHITCHAT
Those are the only two places are only three places you can learn how to do any kind of art was library, school and friends you know.	CHITCHAT
And the sucky part about that is like if you had friends most of the time.	CHITCHAT

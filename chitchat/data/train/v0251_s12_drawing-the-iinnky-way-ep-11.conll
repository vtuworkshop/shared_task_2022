I want to make art and this isn't seem like anything that's Gonna get me anywhere.	CHITCHAT
You know it's like it's just.	CHITCHAT
It's just you sketching whatever and then later on when you actually need reference.	CHITCHAT
You don't have it because you've never actually practiced doing any of this stuff.	CHITCHAT
You just kind of assume that you know whatever, it doesn't work, you know.	CHITCHAT
How do you cope with?	CHITCHAT
How do you?	CHITCHAT
How do you cope with when things put your pull your attention off of project?	CHITCHAT
You have to start again?	CHITCHAT
So you mean like?	CHITCHAT
How do I?	CHITCHAT
How do I deal with?	CHITCHAT
Like if I'm working on a project and then something pulls me away from it?	CHITCHAT
You know How do I get back to starting a project again like give me like go back to it after I've been pulled away from it.	CHITCHAT
Actually me being pulled away from a project actually helps me sometimes see that project in a different light.	CHITCHAT
It's OK to have several different projects running at once, and that's the thing that people will get.	CHITCHAT
They will shy away from is like when they're drawing or whatever.	CHITCHAT
They always want to work on that one thing.	CHITCHAT
No one ever wants to stop and just start another project.	CHITCHAT
You know, I love that I will stop mid project and be like I'm going to come back to that like test sheets like these candles.	CHITCHAT
This is not a finished thing.	CHITCHAT
This is just what I drew yesterday.	CHITCHAT
And then I just walked away from it, you know.	CHITCHAT
And then I'll come back to it later, and I'll add to it.	CHITCHAT
That's why I have existing test.	CHITCHAT
She's that aren't finished, they just kind of keep growing.	CHITCHAT
Art pieces as well.	CHITCHAT
If I get into a piece of art and I get to a point where I can't move on.	CHITCHAT
I just stop or if I get to a point where I'm drawing something tonight and I just don't know how to do it, I will research and learn how to do it and then come back to it later.	CHITCHAT
You know, like I do that a lot.	CHITCHAT
I have several projects that I'm working on now.	CHITCHAT
Working on a book.	CHITCHAT
I'm working on a comic that I have.	CHITCHAT
I haven't worked on the comic and almost four months.	CHITCHAT
I started it and I got little headway into it.	CHITCHAT
I got really excited and I started making new characters for it and I walked away.	CHITCHAT
In the book.	CHITCHAT
The book thing came up and now I'm doing the book thing.	CHITCHAT
I also do tattoo so I draw tattoo designs like I have several things going on at all times, you know.	CHITCHAT
You know, so like for like for me with as far as tattooing is goes.	CHITCHAT
I sketch all the time because.	CHITCHAT
You know you sketch out your designs for your tattoo for your client or whatever the book.	CHITCHAT
I don't necessarily have to sketch so much, you know, but I mean I do it because I know that I want as much illustration in the book as possible, you know.	CHITCHAT
And if I don't sketch like all of these images right here will not make it into the book.	CHITCHAT
I'm literally only going to pick the ones that I want, but I want to draw so many different.	CHITCHAT
Poses and stuff like that that I have a large variety to pick from and then like when I get bored, I'm going to stop and then move on and stuff like that, you know.	CHITCHAT
Sounds the same way I managed.	CHITCHAT
I love sketching old buildings and line art, but I but I also work on designs.	CHITCHAT
For penance For my wife and said, oh see like that's cool like I.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like if you if you ever get to a point where you actually just feel like you know you want to walk away and do something else like don't ever for as far as as far as me, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't ever feel bad about it I'm like OK now I got two projects that I'm working on.	CHITCHAT
My problem is when I have nothing.	CHITCHAT
To work on.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if anybody ever really experiences that, but you feel like you.	CHITCHAT
You feel like you're wasting your life where you feel like you're wasting your productivity because you haven't done anything you know or you don't have anything on the table.	CHITCHAT
You know for me, I need to have a bunch of things on the table.	CHITCHAT
I need to be working on a whole bunch of stuff, and if I'm not I'm just like Oh my God, I'm wasting my life.	CHITCHAT
What am I doing here?	CHITCHAT
This is worthless like I should really be doing something.	CHITCHAT
And if I'm not then I try to find things to do.	CHITCHAT
That's where the book and things.	CHITCHAT
That's what book thing came from.	CHITCHAT
'cause I draw test.	CHITCHAT
She's all the time.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just giant sheets of random stuff 'cause I love to sketch and I'm like I do all of this and I don't do anything with it.	CHITCHAT
And then I was talking to a friend and she kinda wanted to take the tests that I have and throw them in a book and I I kind of wanted to do something different.	CHITCHAT
I didn't want to put.	CHITCHAT
The tests that I had because most of them were a fan art because our most of my tests that I do, I ask people.	CHITCHAT

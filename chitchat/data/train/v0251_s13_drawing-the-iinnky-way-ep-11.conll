What they want me to draw and then I just I just draw it.	CHITCHAT
And it's usually superheroes and stuff like that because most people just want to see anime characters and superheroes to the Super popular right now.	CHITCHAT
I decided that.	CHITCHAT
I took something that I knew people wanted to draw a lot that 'cause it constantly asked me to do it and I turned it into something that they could learn from.	CHITCHAT
My whole goal was to basically draw and make these things so that I would never have to draw them.	CHITCHAT
Again, you know if I didn't want to.	CHITCHAT
So when I'm done with this book, this book should give you enough information about how I do things.	CHITCHAT
As to where I would never have to actually draw it myself, which is generally where I'm going with it is like OK.	CHITCHAT
Well, you know, I know I'm going to be asked can I draw this character?	CHITCHAT
And if it's if it's if it's if it's anywhere in the spectrum of what I'm working on right now, I will recommend him the book, you know.	CHITCHAT
'cause it will teach them everything they need to know and then they could do it themselves rather than asking someone else 'cause.	CHITCHAT
My goal is to get people to draw every day.	CHITCHAT
You know I always try to get.	CHITCHAT
Like people that watch my stream and channel to understand that I don't want to be one of those artists that just set up and let people watch me draw.	CHITCHAT
You know, I most of the stuff I do is to get other people to be better at art.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't care about.	CHITCHAT
People knowing that I can draw in and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I want people to understand that what I'm doing is an important and you can do it too.	CHITCHAT
And people here that all the time from everybody.	CHITCHAT
That is that a professional artist or has been an artist for awhile.	CHITCHAT
That's that motivational speech you get.	CHITCHAT
That's like you can do it too.	CHITCHAT
I want people to understand that you actually can do it because I was garbage, you know.	CHITCHAT
and I got good because I practiced every day.	CHITCHAT
The single the single want the one single thing that's overlooked constantly that's been told you forever is practice will make you better, but no one.	CHITCHAT
No one really that then The thing is like one thing you have to understand is like like focused practice.	CHITCHAT
Obviously is going to make you better, so you have to understand what you want to get better at.	CHITCHAT
You know when you're practicing.	CHITCHAT
Also, you don't have to practice the boring stuff, you know the practices in the boring stuff is what you practice when you know like something is off.	CHITCHAT
It's a choice that you make.	CHITCHAT
You know you don't have to sit down and be like OK, I gotta practice.	CHITCHAT
Live Anatomy studies.	CHITCHAT
You don't have to do that.	CHITCHAT
You know, I know.	CHITCHAT
When people learn how to draw hands, they all I see so many people get frustrated with drawing hands because the hands that they want to draw our big, burly, muscular smashing Hulk hands or tiny petite pretty girl hands and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Nobody wants to draw boring old like realistic anything unless they're doing realism, you know.	CHITCHAT
Most people want to do something most people don't want to practice drawing anything.	CHITCHAT
Most people are working on a piece and they need to know how to draw this particular hand or posed to complete this piece.	CHITCHAT
So the minute you start telling them to practice their like I'm in the middle of drawing something or I'm in the middle of working on something I don't have time to practice.	CHITCHAT
I need to get this piece out because it's it's trending and I need people to see that I'm doing what's trending right now so they can come and look at my artwork and be like Yo This guy is this guy or girl is doing whatever is trending so I can get a few more likes or hopefully have somebody follow me, you know.	CHITCHAT
And this is kind of what most artists are doing.	CHITCHAT
That are in that beginning stages and on that rat race.	CHITCHAT
What I'm trying to get to understand is to take a step back from consistently trying to get people to look at what you're doing and work on work on you.	CHITCHAT
Being interested in what you're doing and in that same light people will follow you because they will be more interested in what you're doing because you show passion it.	CHITCHAT
Lot of people don't necessarily want a lot of people don't necessarily want to hear somebody that's consistently talking about how good they are, you know.	CHITCHAT
But a person will listen to you when you're not talking about yourself and you're talking about the betterment of them.	CHITCHAT
You know, I want you to get better, because if you get better it think about it like this.	CHITCHAT
This is something that.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people don't necessarily think about, but it makes perfect sense if you help other people get better, you might unlock hidden skills in someone that may ultimately later on help you get better.	CHITCHAT
Meaning, imagine teaching somebody that later on becomes becomes so good that their art inspires you.	CHITCHAT

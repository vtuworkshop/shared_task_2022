Now other people have their other methods and that's The thing is like an artist.	CHITCHAT
So many different ways of doing things that there isn't really a standard.	CHITCHAT
You know, there's just the way that you do it in the way that other people do it, you know, but you have to have a way to communicate what you're doing to other people.	CHITCHAT
You know otherwise you just you basically just rambling.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of people that are probably listening in my can't make heads or tails of what I'm talking about, you know, and it's just because they haven't been in long enough and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
See me with when it comes like with client work and professional work.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Our personal work.	CHITCHAT
I don't, I don't do I don't do any personal work at all while I'm doing client work.	CHITCHAT
I literally have to be done with all client working order.	CHITCHAT
Do personal work.	CHITCHAT
I unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
You know, or Fortunately however, you want to look at it.	CHITCHAT
I'm a tattoo artist, so I don't necessarily get a lot of time to do.	CHITCHAT
You know personal stuff, but I try to make myself faster so that like when I get up in the morning and I get ready to go to my day job, my goal is to try to bang out something Super Quick.	CHITCHAT
Before I go to work, so that's my that's my time to do my my personal stuff.	CHITCHAT
When I'm at home.	CHITCHAT
It's not, we don't.	CHITCHAT
We don't do day jobs stuff at home or we don't know we don't do.	CHITCHAT
We don't do personal stuff.	CHITCHAT
You know when I get off work, you know when I get off work like right now this is not.	CHITCHAT
This is, it's attached sheet or whatever, but it's 4 bits for a bigger purpose.	CHITCHAT
Like my project that I'm working on is my book.	CHITCHAT
So like I have to force myself to do my book project.	CHITCHAT
Because if I don't I will never do it in people like well, that seems like a personal.	CHITCHAT
It seems like personal work it's not.	CHITCHAT
Because.	CHITCHAT
If it wasn't for me trying to get out of drawing stuff, I wouldn't be doing this.	CHITCHAT
This is more like a.	CHITCHAT
This is more like a strategic business move on my part.	CHITCHAT
You know where?	CHITCHAT
I just don't want to.	CHITCHAT
I literally just don't want to draw specific things anymore.	CHITCHAT
And this is my way of getting around doing that.	CHITCHAT
You know, like making a book, it seems a little bit extreme, but.	CHITCHAT
No one ever, ever ever says anything bad about someone doing an extreme and it's going to extreme measures to get out of doing something.	CHITCHAT
If if I were to, if someone were to ask me, you know.	CHITCHAT
How do they Draw Something?	CHITCHAT
and I gave them like a ton 8 Hon of stuff that will completely help him and put the ball in their court.	CHITCHAT
There's no way in the world that could be angry about that are below or or feel like you you know like I feel like you are blowing him off, you know.	CHITCHAT
Like imagine if someone came in and they're like hey, teach me how to draw a nose and I gave you like a two minute 2 minute quick like version of how to draw a nose.	CHITCHAT
You know you of course would probably be appreciative 'cause I took my time, but at the same time it's like.	CHITCHAT
You will more than likely be back asking again because you might not understand that two minute version, but if I did something that was so elaborate that there's no way in the world you couldn't possibly learn something from it.	CHITCHAT
You know, or if you just asked me to Draw Something, I just draw it.	CHITCHAT
It makes it OK.	CHITCHAT
You know, like if you ask me to draw ninja turtle and I drew an epic.	CHITCHAT
Drawing of a ninja turtle.	CHITCHAT
Anybody that asked me to draw ninja turtle after that I can just show them that epic drawing.	CHITCHAT
And that's kind of where I'm at with it.	CHITCHAT
Just like, OK.	CHITCHAT
Well, I may not want to do it, but.	CHITCHAT
But if I draw an epic version of whatever it is that you ask me.	CHITCHAT
Future people that come to ask I can just show them that.	CHITCHAT
You know, and then I never have to do it again.	CHITCHAT
You only have to draw it once, and that's kind of went out.	CHITCHAT
I started thinking like you know when it's when people asked me to draw things instead of me consistently being like I'm working on this.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe later I will actually draw it.	CHITCHAT
I'll be like, OK, let's just put it in this area right here so I don't forget.	CHITCHAT
And then I do this.	CHITCHAT
I do these things called test sheets.	CHITCHAT
Which I talk about a lot.	CHITCHAT

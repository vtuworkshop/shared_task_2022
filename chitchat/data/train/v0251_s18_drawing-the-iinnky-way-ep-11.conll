You could easily.	CHITCHAT
You can easily just phone it in.	CHITCHAT
When I try to I try to do is I try to bring it to a different level.	CHITCHAT
You know a lot of stuff that I'm asked to do is just kind of basic, you know, but	CHITCHAT
Like I was telling, like I was telling a couple of people that I'm like trying to get to tattoo like my son is like stuff like this is done every day, right?	CHITCHAT
But not to this caliber not to this level plus.	CHITCHAT
Once you get used to doing it.	CHITCHAT
A certain way.	CHITCHAT
You know, you understand what makes a tattoo look like a tattoo.	CHITCHAT
You know, there's a lot of.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of things that you can.	CHITCHAT
That you could learn a lot of techniques that you can learn that will give you.	CHITCHAT
That will give you a better feel for how you're drawing stuff and it will make your tattoo feel more alive.	CHITCHAT
And and when you're getting paid hundreds of dollars an hour to draw on a body.	CHITCHAT
This kind of stuff like the average artist could look at this and be like that's kind of plane is basic.	CHITCHAT
Until you try to draw it on skiing and you realize that the trick is to be able to draw this and then bring it to life in one shot.	CHITCHAT
There is no do over.	CHITCHAT
There is no control Z.	CHITCHAT
It's all one shot so you have to plan it all out and hope that your plan works before you execute it.	CHITCHAT
You know now if you do it for years you get so good at it that it's like I already know exactly how this is going to work.	CHITCHAT
I have no doubt that what I'm about to do is going to work exactly how I think it's going to work, you know?	CHITCHAT
Also, you get a little bit looser with what you do because you know that going overboard.	CHITCHAT
Means you, like I draw my stencils by hand after I've already drawn the tattoo.	CHITCHAT
So you like, a stencil is basically what you put on the body.	CHITCHAT
So like this steampunk octopus that I was asked to do, for example.	CHITCHAT
You draw the octopus, right?	O
And then of course you mark it up on the body is show how it's going to go on the body now.	O
For those of you don't, don't know it necessarily how tattooing works like you have the body here, but everything that's kind of outside of the lines is wraparound, meaning is going to wrap around whatever part of the body it is.	O
You know every part of the body connects to another part of the body, so it just wraps around.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
This has a lot of detail in it.	O
The more detail you put in the piece, the more detail you have to sketch out.	O
So all of these little bolts and screws and all of this stuff I have to hand draw this again.	O
And then when I put it on the body I have to hand draw a third time.	O
So essentially I'm redrawing this tattoo three times.	O
This is an actual tattoo I was commissioned to do.	O
So we commissioned me to do a steampunk octopus.	O
I just took the opportunity to do it, you know, now I was first time ever did steampunk, so I did I think I did OK, but I clearly know that I need more.	O
This is what you get.	CHITCHAT
This is what you commonly get in tattooing.	O
These are some of the most common tattoos you get.	O
Butterflies and Flowers.	O
But If you know anything about composition and you know anything about Feng Shuei and how to make things flow in in selected space and stuff like that, you understand how to align these Flowers in such a way to where they move, they feel like they were made for the body, so this particular you know, set of Flowers and butterflies are drawn in such a way that no matter how this person moves their body, it will complement the piece that's.	O
A skill you have to learn also if you look at the way that the leaves and stuff or drawn you don't necessarily have to do all of that.	O
I gave the leaves more of a 3D field so it feels like the leaves are.	O
3 dimensional, you know in a part of the body rather than just drawn some flatly, some flat 2 dimensional leaves and colored him green.	O
Either one of them would do is the same thing with these monarch butterflies.	O
There's not too many different poses.	O
You can draw butterfly in the body to make it look 3D, so.	O
You know a lot of it becomes repetition until you start doing like elaborate drawings you know.	O
Idea to draw.	O
I did a tattoo of 50 butterflies.	CHITCHAT
And that was probably like the IT was literally probably like the most nerve wrecking thing ever.	CHITCHAT

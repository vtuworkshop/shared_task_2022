Most tattoo artists can't draw.	CHITCHAT
You know, and I was trying to get people to understand that like there's a you could learn how to draw tattoo flash and people are like what's tattoo flash.	CHITCHAT
This will be considered tattoo flash.	CHITCHAT
As sad as it might sound.	CHITCHAT
Tattoo flash is literally tattoo artists.	CHITCHAT
Like throwaway sketch work.	CHITCHAT
So basically they will draw a bunch of different images and then they will take the images later on and put them in a book and sell them to other tattoo artists.	CHITCHAT
With, you know.	CHITCHAT
Up-and-coming skills, or they feel like there's there lacking in the skillful area.	CHITCHAT
Same thing with this.	CHITCHAT
Like you take a concept, you draw a bunch of different concepts in the.	CHITCHAT
Once you tattoo won, the rest of 'em basically can be used as Tattoo Flash.	CHITCHAT
So for me, I'll drive like I'll draw like four or five different versions of a design and then show it to the client and then whatever the client picks the rest of it.	CHITCHAT
Will basically just go toward.	CHITCHAT
Me doing whatever you know I.	CHITCHAT
Have a ton of tattoo flash, but because I don't really like to do flash, I kind of.	CHITCHAT
Ecologist sits there and gathers dust.	CHITCHAT
One of my one of my most prominent in noticeable flash pieces are my hearts, my heart collection.	CHITCHAT
These particular pieces.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people.	CHITCHAT
Like they don't like when I was when I was learning how to tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Are Like I hated drawing a lot of stuff.	CHITCHAT
And our our boss are the owner of the shop was basically like the only way you're going to get good at anything is to find a way to love it.	CHITCHAT
So basically they made us pick something that we hated to draw and made us draw until we liked it.	CHITCHAT
Me mines was Valentine Hearts I hated hearts in the shape of hearts because they look like butts.	CHITCHAT
So what we basically did was we basically I basically started the heart collection where I would draw designs.	CHITCHAT
You know, infused with the shape of a heart you know, and I still do these to this day.	CHITCHAT
This is just the one that I show off the most, but this is my heart collection.	CHITCHAT
These are tattoos.	CHITCHAT
These are actual ready to tattoo tattoos.	CHITCHAT
I've tattooed a lot of 'em.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And I have images of him and stuff like that, but a lot of this stuff is is me pushing the envelope.	CHITCHAT
Trying to see what I can create with the shape of a heart.	CHITCHAT
You know, and it became something really fun.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
And now every time I come up with something or I learn how to Draw Something new, I will go back and do my heart, another heart for the heart collection and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
But that's where I like practicing stuff comes in and this is what you know for anybody.	CHITCHAT
That's always 'cause there's always a lot of people that are like, well, what's the why would I need to learn how to know?	CHITCHAT
Why would I need to spend that much time practicing and stuff like that?	CHITCHAT
You know, 'cause you always got people that are kind of like why, why this and why?	CHITCHAT
That and I always try to explain to him is like look, listen.	CHITCHAT
You want to make money.	CHITCHAT
You know you have to know how to do things.	CHITCHAT
Say someone comes to you and they ask you for something that you normally don't.	CHITCHAT
Do you know?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you could easily be like, no, I don't want to do it.	CHITCHAT
Or you could take the opportunity to see you could actually seize the opportunity to do something great.	CHITCHAT
Rather than just letting it pass you by, you know, and it's sad when you see people like like, especially artists.	CHITCHAT
They talk about how they would love to do stuff, but they don't.	CHITCHAT
They can't get business and they don't know how to sell their art or or they.	CHITCHAT
The things that people ask him for.	CHITCHAT
They can't do and it's like all of that stuff could be solved easily by just practicing.	CHITCHAT
You know, getting out there in.	CHITCHAT
Understanding and learning more.	CHITCHAT
You know, like I don't understand why people just.	CHITCHAT
Refused to broaden their horizon when it comes to doing anything that has to do with like art.	CHITCHAT
You don't necessary if you're a sketch artist, you don't necessarily have to stick with sketching.	CHITCHAT
You could do something way greater than sketching.	CHITCHAT
You know you could, you know like that.	CHITCHAT
It's not saying that sketching is bad.	CHITCHAT
It's saying like you could learn painting.	CHITCHAT
You could learn painting and painting will increase the way that you color your sketches.	CHITCHAT
You know you could learn sculpting.	CHITCHAT

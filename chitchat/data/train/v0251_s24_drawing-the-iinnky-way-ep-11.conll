When you learn the Y, the Y opens up your brain and allows you to understand like.	CHITCHAT
Better, better.	CHITCHAT
It gives you better knowledge on how to compose something.	CHITCHAT
So now you know I'm going to draw face and I'm going to make this this girl look in a certain direction in your brain.	O
You already know that there exists an eyeball.	O
There exists an eyeball crap I thought.	O
There exists I click that Red.	O
Why is it trying to read?	O
There we go?	CHITCHAT
There exists an eyeball underneath this.	O
In this person is and there's the iris.	O
In this person is looking this way.	O
And the more and more you understand that well, actually, that kind of curved up, I would probably have to make that more.	O
Like	CHITCHAT
This well I mean yeah, I mean, I guess it's kind of right, it is it is.	O
It is kind of like that.	CHITCHAT
Well anyways, that.	CHITCHAT
When you understand this, you know and you also understand that there's an eye over here and this I.	O
Is over here like this?	CHITCHAT
And then the other eyeball is over here.	O
That was in your head, you know, but.	O
Would you understand that when you draw it and you don't understand why you're drawing in the islands?	O
Funny, you stop and you think, wait a minute.	O
OK, if I'm drawing this, I the reason why it looks weird.	O
It's because this I is underneath and I'm drawing it looking like.	O
You know this when its axis supposed to be drawn like that and it gives you.	O
It gives you a bit of orientation, gives you a big, gives you it, gives you a little bit of Browning, so now you can actually look at the peace and be like OK, this should be.	O
If I'm going to draw this, it should be like this.	O
You know, so that I can get this my I should be here like this.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
And that means if the iris are if the area of the.	O
The eyelid.	O
Is here.	O
You should only see this part.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
And it starts becoming starts to make more sense.	O
Now when you look at it, you'll start understanding you know like now when I look at and I, I don't necessarily look at the eye and see the person with the I see the underneath.	O
I see this.	CHITCHAT
Underneath the eyelid is so like you know you have your eyeball underneath, you know and you have.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
This is what I see.	CHITCHAT
This is what I see.	CHITCHAT
That's what I see.	CHITCHAT
So now I have to do is teach my brain to move.	O
That's it.	CHITCHAT
That's fear.	CHITCHAT
In a make it look 3 dimensional on a 2D surface.	O
You know which is a lot easier than you think.	O
It's not hard, it's just your brain.	O
You're teaching your brain how to work with your hands.	O
Your brain can't.	O
Your brain can't compose a lot of the stuff that you're seeing.	O
You know your brain sees it.	O
It understands it because it's seen it a million times, but trying to reconstruct it your brain is having a hard time with that.	O
Your brain is like I've seen this a million times, but for some reason I don't know how to draw.	O
You know, I don't know where to start.	O
You know, once you get enough detail on paper, your brain will latch onto it and your brain will be like, oh, I get it.	O
I get it now.	CHITCHAT
OK, I've seen this before and it will tell your hands to do a thing you know now the other thing that you run into when you when it comes to that kind of stuff is.	O
Muscle memory.	O
A lot of times when you're drawing anything, muscle memory will play a big part in how well you draw and how smooth it comes out.	O
Muscle memory will kick your butt.	CHITCHAT
Because wing if you don't.	O
If you've never drawn something.	O
Or if you've never moved in a certain pattern.	O
A lot you have your hands or your brain is not familiar with making your hands move that way and your hands aren't used to moving in that specific motion.	O
Which is why when you see people draw, they always draw in a specific direction or they start.	O
They start top to bottom or they do certain movements like certain people's artwork can be.	O

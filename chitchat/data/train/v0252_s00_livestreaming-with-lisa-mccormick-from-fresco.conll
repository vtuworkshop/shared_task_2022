All right, hey everyone, welcome back to another live stream today.	CHITCHAT
I am going to be working on as you can see I've got a couple of sketches already pulled up, but I'm going to be working on some different kind of like Midwest themed Woods.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just fun, like little pieces and memorabilia, so um.	O
Let me just.	CHITCHAT
Make sure everything is set up and running.	CHITCHAT
And OK.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
OK, so yeah, that's uh.	CHITCHAT
Things are looking good.	CHITCHAT
So basically today I was trying to think of like what did I want to stream.	CHITCHAT
And uhm, I always.	CHITCHAT
Hi, it's like doing things that feel a little bit more personal.	CHITCHAT
Personal.	CHITCHAT
And so yeah, this is going to be like A.	O
Fun model.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hello, stream says you can see I kind of have some different animals that I really wanted to focus on, which are just different animals that are found in the Woods.	O
I guess you could say whenever I I'll go out.	O
Like a run or something through forest preserve, I usually see a squirrel or a deer.	O
Also, probably draw in a bird.	O
Yeah, then there's also lots of Coyotes, and Fox is.	O
And what not so.	CHITCHAT
I know I want to for sure incorporate the different animals.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
This flag design up as you can see it says our BM that was part of a sketch, an old sketch for a client that didn't end up getting used, but it's something that.	O
That idea is cool.	CHITCHAT
Um, of like that vintage pendant.	O
Pendant flags I want to come.	O
Can trace over this real quick.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So as I was saying I am so I am from the Midwest.	CHITCHAT
I'm from the Chicago area in the United States and.	CHITCHAT
Although I love traveling a lot and I love going out West Uhm.	CHITCHAT
I have not been able to do that much since of since.	CHITCHAT
Obviously covid and um.	CHITCHAT
I've been spending a lot more time just going through runs and long bike rides through the forests, and that's kind of what's inspiration for today that Camden says yo the grid paper is cool.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I uhm.	CHITCHAT
I've recently been sketching a lot more on grid paper because I feel like.	CHITCHAT
Um, it definitely it just kind of helps you really quickly easily get the right proportion.	CHITCHAT
So, uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, definitely recommend it if you're going for a more like geometric, are proportional look.	CHITCHAT
And this is just super super cheap paper too.	CHITCHAT
I think it was maybe.	CHITCHAT
$5 for I don't know how like 300 pages, you know?	CHITCHAT
Camden says yes, bike rides always bring the inspirations in new ideas.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, totally me too and.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I've taken for granted, uhm, a lot of just this landscape of, uh, what's directly right around me like Emma is wanting to travel out West.	CHITCHAT
To get more of that inspiration, but I've been honestly realizing more and more lately.	CHITCHAT

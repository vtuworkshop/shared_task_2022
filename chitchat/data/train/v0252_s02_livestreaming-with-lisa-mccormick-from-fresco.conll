Alright, I don't know exactly what if I'll be able to use this Patch or not, but I just kind of thought that was a fun thing.	CHITCHAT
I feel like even 'cause I'm drawing a squirrel, it might be kind of cool to do the little 8 corn.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Which I also feel like it's like a very like Forrest Midwest.	O
Nostalgic thing.	O
I remember.	CHITCHAT
Growing up As a kid in finding acorns like all in the forest.	CHITCHAT
Camden is asking do you find when drawing music helps you or does it distract you?	CHITCHAT
It definitely helps me.	CHITCHAT
It's actually kind of a bit of a bummer that during the live streams I'm not able to listen to music because.	CHITCHAT
It would mess up the audio, uhm?	CHITCHAT
But no, I I love.	CHITCHAT
I love listening to music and just kind of getting lost.	CHITCHAT
It definitely helps me.	CHITCHAT
I also will listen to podcasts or sometimes I'll even have a good TV show in the background or whatnot.	CHITCHAT
Or audio books.	CHITCHAT
I've started doing more audio books lately, but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I definitely enjoy it for sure.	CHITCHAT
OK, very cool 8 corn.	CHITCHAT
And then I feel like he needs like a little.	O
Texture.	O
OK, so that's my acorn.	O
And let's see, let's see.	CHITCHAT
What else feels super?	CHITCHAT
Midwest City That's a good draw or write out.	O
Goodbye.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK.	CHITCHAT
So I don't really know if that this acorn is making any sense in here, but will, I guess I'm kind of see.	O
Maybe it would be like a cool thing to have like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
It is like a placeholder, almost 4.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Some text I don't know yet.	CHITCHAT
I'll say that but and then also, I was kind of thinking of again.	O
I want to try to switch up my colors again like I always experiment and see what other colors I can start to incorporate.	O
So feel like this green is like a background would be cool 'cause it's super super super nostalgic and like kind of just like that Forest Green.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm thinking like a yellow.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Camden is asking do you practice texture a bunch or have any tips?	CHITCHAT

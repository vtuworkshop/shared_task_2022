You're showing the work that you want to have, so it's not just you showing, uhm, how you can.	CHITCHAT
Do, um, like I'm just going to say, for example, how you can, how you're able to like Excel at illustration.	CHITCHAT
But then maybe you don't feel confident in web design, but you feel like you should show it.	CHITCHAT
So you're going to show kind of like a mediocre web design page, but then really great illustration and then a mediocre.	CHITCHAT
I don't know something else, but then really good.	CHITCHAT
Product design and it's like you, I would say don't try to be the Jack of all trades, just try just show the work that you want to do and want to get hired for.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to do illustration only, show that and show your best work and show the work that you actually want to do.	CHITCHAT
So like I wanted to work in the outdoor industry so I started before I even got all the clients that I wanted.	CHITCHAT
I just made up my own work in my made up my own prompts.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Like they were ones that are similar to the work.	CHITCHAT
Then they ended up getting hired for an yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of.	CHITCHAT
It's a lot of self initiated work.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
So kind of playing with my sketch a little bit here.	CHITCHAT
As you can see.	CHITCHAT
And I don't know if I really love.	CHITCHAT
Of what I've got going on?	CHITCHAT
Wondering if I can somehow incorporate?	CHITCHAT
Midwest.	CHITCHAT
In this text.	CHITCHAT
Yeah no problem.	CHITCHAT
Camden Uhm Yeah, I hope that helps you come out and.	CHITCHAT
You know, I think another big thing is just persistence and, um.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I totally believe that if you stick to it and just keep.	CHITCHAT
Keep learning, keep developing your skills.	CHITCHAT
You can totally do it so.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Now that I cannot have like some different random sketches mapped out.	O
I think I want to take a step back and.	O
Start 2.	O
Put this a little bit more into like text.	O
Let's see.	O
So so for these I'm going to group them together.	O
Duplicate.	O
I was like keeping all of my layers on.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I guess like.	CHITCHAT
Only together with uhm.	CHITCHAT
Oh, Why is that?	CHITCHAT
Did you that wrong?	CHITCHAT
OK, never mind there it is.	CHITCHAT
OK, so that's for the scroll.	CHITCHAT

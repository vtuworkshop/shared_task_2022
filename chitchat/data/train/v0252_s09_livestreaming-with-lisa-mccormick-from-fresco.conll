And I want to.	CHITCHAT
Trying to think if I want to keep this green background 'cause it feels a little intense, uhm?	O
Or if I should switch over to like a cream.	O
So it's a little bit more, uhm?	O
Easy to work with.	O
And then I can kind of use the Green Maybe?	O
An see.	CHITCHAT
How is it in different areas?	CHITCHAT
Although I couldn't even like that, but also.	O
I think I do need to make up.	O
My dear.	CHITCHAT
Brown So we just drop that in.	O
Oh, I kind of made it weird.	O
Just mask Slayer.	O
OK, now he's Brown.	O
And I'm going to.	O
Grab the screen.	O
Miss Claire and.	O
Turn that Green and said OK, that actually feels a heck of a lot more.	O
Balance.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK, and then I would say that.	O
The red on this feels a little bit too intense, maybe.	O
So let me go back in.	O
Mask that layer.	O
See if I tone it down a little bit that feels better.	O
Also, I don't know.	O
If he really needs these.	O
Yellow Um?	O
Strokes.	O
Oh no, but now I feel like that's almost like a little bit too hard to see.	O
So let's see pink.	O
That might be a little bit too soft.	O
About is that.	O
Brighter red Now I feel like I'm making like a children's book.	O
Which I actually did.	O
Just make a children's book, so I guess that's.	O
That's not too far out of my.	CHITCHAT
Comfort zone uhm.	CHITCHAT
I don't know should I keep the red?	O
I don't know if it is making sense, uh, what about a little bit more replica?	O
Pink know maybe more orange.	O

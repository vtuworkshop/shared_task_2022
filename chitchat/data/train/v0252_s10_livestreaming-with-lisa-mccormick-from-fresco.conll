Especially starting out in my career, I learned a lot from other people just kind of doing the same thing that you are Camden just asking and.	CHITCHAT
Exploring and figuring out you know, like how did.	CHITCHAT
How did they get to where they are?	CHITCHAT
And uhm, I kinda would learn from a bunch of other people and then take all those different.	CHITCHAT
Pieces that I've learned in in kind of create my own.	CHITCHAT
My own path, but kind of still.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like mixing a lot of pieces, I have learned from others, but then doing having almost like my own take on it so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm always more than happy to share, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Seriously, it's like one of my.	CHITCHAT
One of the ways that like I want to give back to the creative community and.	CHITCHAT
I'm also really big advocate for small businesses.	CHITCHAT
So any time that I can help someone else gain the UM, skill set, I guess for running their own freelancing business or whatnot, I always really enjoy that as well, so.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thanks for for being here and for asking and.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited to come.	CHITCHAT
See where your journey leads you.	CHITCHAT
So now I'm just kind of going over and refining.	O
Everything, so I'm actually using.	O
It's called a vector brush and um.	O
Making sure.	O
The lines are all nice and, um, smooth.	O
Or as I like to say crispy, nice and crisp.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Go in and clean up a little bit of that.	O
Also, this is just kind of a side note as I'm just kind of talking out loud.	O
Well, I'm drawing and thinking, um?	O
Yesterday I actually deleted my Instagram app.	O
not I didn't delete my profile or anything.	O
I'm all go back on Instagram, but I just I felt like I was like getting so distracted and consumed by Instagram as its.	CHITCHAT
You know a very distracting and consuming thing.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I love Instagram.	CHITCHAT
It's really fun, but I'm also aware at how almost like addicted I can get two different social media and so anyway.	CHITCHAT
I deleted the app off my phone just so that I wouldn't be on it and distracted today and it has actually been so nice like I didn't realize how much of a like.	CHITCHAT
Just like breath of fresh air, I would feel today from.	CHITCHAT
From just deleting one of my.	CHITCHAT
Social media apps.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of crazy, but yeah.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, if you guys are feeling overwhelmed or anything like that, I would just suggest maybe seeing what you can.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Take out of your life for just a a momentary.	CHITCHAT
Amount of time and focus more on the people that are right in front of you and going outside and connecting with nature, connecting with friends and family.	CHITCHAT
Connecting spiritually, slowing down so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just wanted to share share that.	CHITCHAT
With you 'cause it's it's helped me so much so yeah.	CHITCHAT

Hello Noma an alhandra, how are you guys doing today?	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I feel like Instagram is one of those things where I've always like.	CHITCHAT
Kenna said, like, Oh yeah, I don't think I'm addicted to it or anything like I think I'm fine, um.	CHITCHAT
And then yesterday I finally got to that point where I felt so.	CHITCHAT
So, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Just overwhelmed and.	CHITCHAT
Is kind of it's wild.	CHITCHAT
Just how much of a difference.	CHITCHAT

I can zoom out and show you what I'm working on, so um, I decided to.	O
Can I do a fun little?	O
Um illustration based on some of these different.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I guess characters is maybe the right word for.	O
Or a different icon.	O
Illustrations for just different animals and such that I've been seeing on my morning runs and bike rides.	O
I think in the beginning of the stream that so I live in the Midwest of the United States, so I'm in the Chicago area and it's very like flat land.	O
Lots of forests, lot SUV.	O
Like lakes and stuff um.	O
Which I feel like I'm I'm more like I get excited about going into like mountains or like going and seeing the ocean or whatnot and kind of taken for granted.	O
I feel like the place that I live.	O
And so obviously with Covid.	CHITCHAT
And not being able to travel I've I feel like I started to appreciate more of just like the local forest preserves that are around here and.	O
Just kind of more so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, celebrating.	O
What's in my backyard rather than you know, traveling across the country.	O
So that's kind of what this is.	O
Camden says thanks for the advice, gotta head out no problem Camden.	CHITCHAT
I hope you have a good rest of your night and will see you later.	CHITCHAT
And so you can see I kind of I have my sketch behind this that uhm.	O
Starting to play with like the different colour schemes and Whatnot.	O
And now I'm going in and doing.	O
Um, like more of like a clean line drawing.	O
Of each of the sketches so that.	O
I can work on the final pieces.	O
Oh, and um.	CHITCHAT
Fresco came out with this new ruler.	O
As you can see them using for straight lines.	O
So that's pretty nice.	O
I can line it up and make sure.	O
Everything is nice.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Crisp So I'll do that with this.	O
Back leg and then actually when I was.	O

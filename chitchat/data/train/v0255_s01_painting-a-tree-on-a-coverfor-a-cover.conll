Make some quick work of it.	CHITCHAT
Gotta.	CHITCHAT
Gotta be careful on that though.	CHITCHAT
You gotta make sure that stuff that's not copy written.	O
I mean you know images of trees, it's.	O
Hard to really say what's happy written by.	O
Yeah, so we're going to.	O
We're going to do that.	O
Sounds like fun.	CHITCHAT
I think it sounds like fun.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and get to it.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
We log off Instagram said were not interrupted so much, you know?	CHITCHAT
Set my timer and we're going to begin.	CHITCHAT
I think the first thing we're going to do.	O
The check this out for a little.	O
Little lesson in.	O
How to clean up some of this?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do.	CHITCHAT
This guide these guys.	O
So that I'm aware of what my live area is.	O
This is honestly a bit of a strange.	O
Size for a book.	O
I don't know how they're using it, but is what they gave me.	O
So I will be aware whenever you're hiring somebody wanted to make sure that you're given the right.	O
Sizes and all that.	O
OK, So what we're going to do?	CHITCHAT
We're going to get rid of the blue lines we have our guides.	O
I'm going to hide him by hitting command; Or control.	O
If you're on a PC.	O
Hit command you.	O
We're going to go to our master here and Drop it down to saillans me.	O
Personally, I liked it up the saturation.	O
Go to Blues up the saturation and hit OK.	O
I swear it acts differently than if you just go back and do this next step, which is what we're about to do.	O
We're going to command you again.	O
Cyan's gonna drop the saturation.	O
And then up the lightness.	O
Same thing with Blues drop, saturation up the lightness.	O
Being all the way to white, if you want to.	O
I don't like to go to white cause a lot of times it leaves holes, but since in this case is not interacting with the line art, it's actually pretty clear.	O
That's the first step.	O
The second step is.	O
For the sake of cleaning it up, I'm gonna turn on my guides.	O
Hit M for marquee.	O
Oh, you know what I turn off my snapping up?	O
Snap to guides.	O
So now I'm right where I wanted to be.	O
Select the inverse command shift I.	O
It D for black-and-white hit command delete to fill with background color, not foreground color.	O
And finally.	CHITCHAT
Man shift you to desaturate, so now this is in black and white.	O
There's not a lot of difference, but there's little difference there, and the reason we're going to do that is because now we're going to use our levels to turn turn these lights lines from Grey's to Blacks, so command L for levels.	O
Left slider makes things darker.	O
Right slider makes the white whiter.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
You gotta be careful 'cause it'll.	O
Her away.	O
At the lines, if you go too much.	O
So when you have something like this, this scan right here is not a very clean scan.	O
It's a little choppy.	O
Maybe the resolution was a little bad.	O
We're going to go a little bit on the left slider.	O
And instead we're going to darken the Greys.	O
Using the Gray instead of black and now he can kind of.	O
Come back to slightly.	O
It's hardly anything I think I even went back.	O
He bring in some of that Gray so we stop losing.	O
Most of the stuff in the background.	O
See right here, these right here.	O
Those lines were part of the cyan, you know.	O
And sometimes you gotta go back in there and paint those out.	O

Since I'm going to be painting over a lot of this, I'm not too worried about it, but I am going to come in and do a really quick Patch job.	O
In fact, you can use.	O
The spot healing brush.	O
Think that's done.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Spot healing brush is pretty cool 'cause he just.	O
What it does is it takes.	O
Everything around it.	O
Like It takes samples from here and then samples from here and then.	O
It just turns it into whatever your brushes.	O
Like it blends him pulling those two edges together so it's kind of cool.	O
Makes it very quick.	O
Patch job.	O
You don't have to worry too much about anything.	O
It's a lot like the content aware.	O
Bill.	O
The photo shop has which is magic.	O
I go see.	O
Like even right here.	O
See how it blends that this edge with that edge?	O
You hardly see any difference.	O
It's really cool.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
But if you go sample did not work.	O
Did you go really large like that, isn't it?	O
Yeah, it takes a little a little longer to process it, but it still does and that's pretty neat, right?	O
So like really, I could go right here and do that.	O
And if there's a little too much.	O
So I'm just going to do that instead.	O
Nice right?	CHITCHAT
Spot healing brush.	O
That's what we're looking at right now.	O
Perdon eat I know.	O
He is that same technique to get rid of that X.	O
And that X.	O
Not crazy like magic.	O
Have any?	CHITCHAT
Let's see now.	CHITCHAT
I think that was about it.	CHITCHAT
And then there was the quickest.	CHITCHAT
Is the quickest cleanup.	O
There was like not even 10 minutes.	O
Good job, good job guys.	CHITCHAT
All right, now we want to save these lines.	O
I like to go to channels down here in the bottom of this dot it again, watch my cursor down here on the bottom where we have this dotted circle.	O
If you hover over that, it says load channel's selection.	O
And I have a selection.	O
It's actually selecting all the white on the image and not selecting the black.	O
Create a new channel.	O
There's two ways to do this.	O
I like to invert my selection, command, shift I.	O
So now I'm selecting all the lines.	O
And then I hit command delete.	O
I'm sorry option delete to fill with white 'cause I have my foreground and background color right here on the right side is Maine.	O
But now this is actually just a snapshot of our lines that we can refer back to if we need to go back and save them, but we're going to paint over a lot of this, specially in the middle ground in background.	O
The foreground is the important part here.	O
Or not too worried about anything in the background, but we're going to start here in a sack.	O
I like to duplicate my layers because I like to use multiply.	O
And I fill.	O
Oh And I filled with.	O
50% Gray I always colorize my lines.	O
Set it to color.	O
So this is going to have a lot of like earthy Browns and greens.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
I think the red will look nice.	O
We're going to go ahead and lock that.	O

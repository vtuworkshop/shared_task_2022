What else do we need to do?	O
Let's see, um.	CHITCHAT
Should we make flats for this?	O
No.	CHITCHAT
We probably should, right?	CHITCHAT
OK, let's make flats.	O
Let's make some flats.	O
Now we're making flats person.	O
I like to work off of.	O
Who's gonna channels load that collection?	O
And then we're going to go ahead and fill it with black.	O
Also going to duplicate this and fill it in white.	O
We're going to create the line art again.	O
Whenever I'm selecting for flats, I like to use the black and white line art over.	O
Um, the colored one.	O
It might be in my head.	O
Sometimes it seems like it's a little better.	O
Also, wow, this is really tiny.	O
All right, we're going to go to preserve details 2.0 that's my favorite for.	O
Raising And make this 6000.	O
In OK.	CHITCHAT
Defline What is up?	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
How are you doing today?	CHITCHAT
He said yes, but yes to what I don't know what you say.	CHITCHAT
Boys have been attention to what I said when you responded, sorry.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it might be in my head.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
I think whenever I select make selections.	O
On like the color eyes line art, which is the red one.	O
Which I will show once my photo shop unfreezes.	O
Oh It seems like the selections are a little fuzzier than if I use the black and White, which makes sense because.	O
Selections in Photoshop works off of value, so you want to make sure that.	O
If you give the better contrast of black with the white, I think it just grabs.	O
Grab the value difference a little better.	O
Doing good things, how is you?	CHITCHAT
I am good.	CHITCHAT
I am full.	CHITCHAT
I just came back from eating.	CHITCHAT
Had a very healthy meal.	CHITCHAT
The double cheeseburger and a milkshake.	CHITCHAT
And fries and now have palpitations.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good, though I'm exaggerating.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good though.	CHITCHAT
Yes to the flats.	O
Got it OK?	CHITCHAT
Well then let's do some flats because D is asking for it.	O
So if he wants it.	O
Degats flats that simple.	O
I think what I want to do.	O
Is select.	O
The main tree trunk.	O
And then this Hill, right here.	O
I'm not going to select the wheat here because I'm I might create a.	O
Brush from this.	O
'cause it's random enough to actually create a really cool brush to add a week here in the front.	O
Or not, we but just like fuzzy grass, but OK, so we're going to go right here.	O
Yep, there we go nice.	O
Make sure where.	O
Not anti alias.	O
We want to be anti anti alias.	O
And fill their.	O
From means you went somewhere.	O
Whatever, yes, I did have water burger.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely, and it was amazing.	CHITCHAT
You know they have and you.	CHITCHAT
Pico de Gaio Burger Bro, let me tell you right now.	CHITCHAT
I want you to stop what you're doing.	CHITCHAT

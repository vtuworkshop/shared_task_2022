I know you're nowhere near one.	CHITCHAT
That's one thing you gotta make yourself one, then there's.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, there's no way around it, pal.	CHITCHAT
You're just going to have to make one for yourself.	CHITCHAT
I could buy one.	CHITCHAT
Flash freeze it and send it your way if you want.	CHITCHAT
Well, saying this, this one right here for this.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Cover I don't have a lot of direction, they just wanted like a slightly decaying tree.	O
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
It's supposed to have like some kind of magic property the tree.	O
Where?	CHITCHAT
It's a portal if I remember correctly.	O
You know now that I think about it, I don't know if I have permission to stream this.	O
So I'm not going to talk about what I do know about the project, which for the record is not a lot.	O
I just know that it's for a book.	O
And I'll stop talking about that now.	CHITCHAT
Maybe halfway drive fast.	O
Also tipping yaki in Hawaiian and Bahama but Bahama Bucks Real Alright.	O
But yeah, So what was I was talking about this particular project not allowed direction.	O
Which makes me nervous.	CHITCHAT
I always get nervous when, uh.	CHITCHAT
Clients don't give me a lot of direction because then that.	CHITCHAT
That typically means that they don't.	CHITCHAT
It's one of two things.	CHITCHAT
They don't know what they want.	CHITCHAT
Or they're just super chill and they're like whatever it's fine as long as it looks good.	CHITCHAT
Most of the time, it's definitely the former.	CHITCHAT
And so that's why I get a little nervous, especially when.	CHITCHAT
When it's a new client, we've never worked together before.	CHITCHAT
But Hopefully if we make it look stellar.	CHITCHAT
It won't matter too much.	CHITCHAT
And what I'm doing right now for you guys just joining.	O
And we haven't seen my stream before.	O
I like to paint.	O
And put the loan and prepare painting.	O
With a process called Flatting.	O
It is incredibly mundane.	O
In uh is boring.	O
It'll make you go a little crazy, but.	O
At the end of the day, it will actually help you.	O
Save a little bit of time.	O
And some of your pieces.	O
Now let's go ahead and fill all of this.	O
Is it going to Maine?	O
Trying to save the tree.	O
Then I'm going to go back and make a second selection for this Hill right here.	O
Only really trying to save this tree right here.	O
You know, I thought the same thing when I saw it.	O
You Mace.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Right now what we're working on is, uh.	O
We're using quick masks, which if you hit Qi think its default set on by default to queue.	O
On your keyboard it'll take you 2 quick mask the and or the interface.	O
It's right here on this.	O
This button right here if you ever click on it.	O
Normally it's backwards though right now, but I'm selecting is green whereas the default is what I'm not selecting is green.	O
Because I tell him, ask actually works like right now.	O
I'm selecting everything around the tree, but I'm asking real life.	O
Have I had a green piece of paper to make a mask?	O
This is exactly how it would make the mask.	O
In real life, for it to work, but digitally my for some reason my hedges sees it backwards like I want to see.	O
What I'm not selecting or what I don't want to select so that I can make sure that my selection is as clean as possible, so that's why I like to go in and do it backwards on this.	O
So we see right here that would select it is all the outside and that's OK.	O

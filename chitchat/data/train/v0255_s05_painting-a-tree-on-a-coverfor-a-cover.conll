We're going to hit select dropdown to modify.	O
I think my images a blocking it, but select modify expand.	O
We're at 400 pixels, so two pixels should be OK.	O
Maybe 1 I'm going to hit 2.	O
That might not have been enough, So what we're going to do is we're going to go back.	O
Select, modify, expand Ringo with three.	O
OK, that's a lot nicer.	O
And now here comes the clean up process is going to take you again, but now most of this stuff is filled in.	O
But I want to fill in.	O
Oh, like this little gap does rock right here.	O
See this.	CHITCHAT
Bill that.	CHITCHAT
Will it in black?	O
Black is selected.	O
White is deselected.	O
There in this one I'm just going to go.	O
Hand.	O
When you're selecting things with the wand and all that, that's just to help you.	O
Get a Head Start.	O
Ultimately, you're still gonna have to go in manually.	O
Clean up what you really need to clean up.	O
But if you do a little by little.	O
It won't be that painful.	O
The with black perfect.	O
Mr.	CHITCHAT
Little spot right there.	O
Oh that was black.	O
Usually flatting will take anywhere from 40 minutes to an hour and a half.	O
Right now we're looking at maybe when is it like 1015 minutes so far and we're almost done.	O
I was going to be a quick one.	O
Get back in here.	O
Cut out where I expand it too much.	O
But with white.	O
Fill this with black.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's The One I was looking for.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Next Gotta Love Flatting, isn't it?	O
Eventful, isn't it fun?	CHITCHAT
Just like the coolest thing you've ever seen.	O
I know it is you don't have to lie.	O
This is the actual line we're going to plug that.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
And I think what I'm actually going to do for the leaves I'm gonna.	O
More than likely.	O
Well, I'm going to be using a.	O
Custom brush Maybe a mixer brush like I might paint a couple of these.	O
Selected with the mixer brush and then use that to fill in the rest.	O
So I'm just selecting that as a whole.	O
I'm not even worried about it.	O
Anything else but.	O
I think this is the last bit.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there's a cast shadow.	O
Next Perfect we did it guys and we did it in record time.	O
Wasn't even 20 minutes.	O
Alright, Little Hill.	O
We got there and select the inverse.	O
We're going to duplicate, right?	O
There were just going to fill it with a crazy red for no reason.	O
Because we're not going to look at, this is going to be covered.	O

They're gonna go back here.	O
And since this is our broken up, I think it just might be easier to trace it by hand.	O
Nobody wants to do things by hand anymore, but he wants it automated.	O
Including me.	O
Sometimes you just get a little tired here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, Here we go.	CHITCHAT
I think what I'm going to do here is I'm just going to select it straight.	O
I'll explain why when I use.	O
My grass brush.	O
Sorry, that made all busy means my grass brush to create that edge.	O
No, that's the same Hill I'm going to say that it isn't, so I'm going to go right there.	O
And get a crazy blue and bam book.	O
Noble and bam, Mario.	O
Next Let's see.	O
Then And go back in real quick and select.	O
All these leaves at didn't.	O
Phil.	O
Then Just for the sake of making it a little clean.	O
Gonna go in.	O
Evil little bleed area.	O
Here, here.	O
There was bugging me that he was so so wild and out of place.	O
OK.	O
We're going to hit save.	O
I don't even think I have.	O
Haven't even save this file yet.	O
'cause I'm never do.	O
Went to the recent commissions folder, create a new one.	O
I.	CHITCHAT
I think it's called the doorway.	O
We're going to call it the doorway P1 perfect alright?	O
Suchat are stylus for a stroke mid with the Little Spring in it.	O
Let's get to doing some black and white painting for now.	O
Couple of things we're going to keep in mind will be touching on it.	O
Well, it happens I guess.	O
Is that this is for print, so it means that.	O
I have to be careful and make sure that I don't go out of the print gamut.	O
Call that F and we're going to turn it off because we can still select on our layers.	O
If it's off, we can still select it, see.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go and use.	O
Black and white.	O
May like to always start with a reverse gradient.	O
Mr create focal point.	O
Make sure that everything around it is darker.	O
So that we're focused right here.	O

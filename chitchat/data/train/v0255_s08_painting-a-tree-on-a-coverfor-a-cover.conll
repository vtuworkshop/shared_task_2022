The Hill.	O
Yes, I can really dark and.	O
The edge of this tree.	O
He had just bought Dark Valley work, made a gloomy Yep.	O
But it's going to be a little.	O
Nicer I think when I'm done with it, hopefully.	O
How is the goal anyway?	O
So what we're going to do is like they were going to use A.	O
Gradient map to paint it to pay most of it.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Then You like that with Sky could stand to be a little brighter.	O
It brings in some of the.	O
Oh, why do we use of gradient but a linear gradient?	O
Said to about 30%.	O
OK, I like that.	CHITCHAT
Men.	CHITCHAT
Check this out.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go into adjustments.	O
Create a gradient map or all of it.	O
A greater map is actually trying to make a gradient out of black and white, or I should say White and black so all the Dark is now white.	O
And all the light is now black, so that's kind of funny, but.	O
You can do the reverse and it does exactly what we already have, red and green.	O
Orange and purple.	O
All these colors that you got, so I think.	O
You might actually have to create one 'cause I don't have anything that's very earthy.	O
Anything that's.	O
Super earthy.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Now we're gonna have to make 1.	O
It looks nice down, looks nice.	O
OK, So what we're going to do?	O
Is we are now going to?	O
Modify this so now again this is black and this is white.	O
So everything that is white.	O
Is going to be assigned the colour that's here and every value in between those two is going to go according to that.	O
We have this color right here.	O
We're going to change it back, apparently.	O
We changed his colored to a green.	O
Fun Orange Green.	O
Orange green, yellow, green.	O
Come up, as in you're better than that.	O
And this one right here.	O
All of them were just dropping him down to the green yellow grains.	O
As it gets warmer, I'm going to push.	O
In a little bit more to the yellow.	O
Could even use this one's.	O
Sky color, if we really wanted to, we could.	O
My Sky is dark, so I could actually make it dark.	O
But we're not going to.	O
Do that.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go under the assumption that they wanted a bright Sky, like a full day.	O

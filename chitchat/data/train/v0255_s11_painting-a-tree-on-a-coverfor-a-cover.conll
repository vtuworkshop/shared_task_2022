OK, so now we're just going to paint in some of the Sky.	O
We're going to come back and.	O
To paint back.	O
These are getting blurred out.	O
We're going to paint them back in.	O
The reason I do want this guy to be a little brighter is because it will make sure that it calls attention to our.	O
Our tree here.	O
Is obviously one.	O
Dark around that.	O
I'm going to know lyrics.	O
I'm not too sure about it so.	O
I don't like it.	CHITCHAT
Bringing his light blue again here.	O
By pure coincidence it goes right where we want it.	O
This area.	O
We're just gonna.	CHITCHAT
9.	CHITCHAT
Want to bring a little bit of that blue 'cause that's going to create?	O
A nice atmospheric perspective on our plants that are out in the background.	O
Gonna come back in right now and clean it up a little further, but for now we're just laying down our our palette.	O
Real nice.	CHITCHAT
Real nice Lake.	CHITCHAT
Make this a little warmer.	O
And I'm curious.	CHITCHAT
Experimental, one of a little hard like grab in Orange.	O
Orange color, not the fruit.	O
If we can.	O
Play with that Sky Little.	O
And I like it.	CHITCHAT
But The thing is that I feel that this orange is now competing with the Orange as we have here, you know.	O
What if we invert that to a blue little wet sway table?	O
When we find a color we like.	O
Some of these colors a little too rich and they won't print.	O
We gotta be careful.	O
Surprisingly, yellow looks kinda nice.	O
OK, what do we do?	CHITCHAT
That yellow?	O
We're going to select this yellow.	O
Bring it in to pretty much the whole Sky.	O
I'm going to go back and grab a blue.	O
Put it where?	CHITCHAT
Touching the horizon.	O
We're going to dial it back though.	O
Erase it.	O
I like that kind of like that Sky still blue.	O
But it's got like that.	O
Richness.	O
It almost feels like there's.	O
Like a son, somewhere you know.	O
I wonder if we.	O
Have some of the lighter.	O
Grab some of his lighter color here.	O
Take it higher, perhaps?	O
Come like that.	O
I like it when you guys think.	O

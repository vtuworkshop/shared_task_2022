I think it's kind of cool.	O
We're going to add a little bit of texture now.	O
OK, so we're going to.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I like the stuff from brush for the Sky, so I'm going to use that.	O
I think I'm pretty sold on those colors right there on the horizon.	O
We're going to merge into R1R.	O
One's going to stay above normal ER one is you know what?	O
Yeah, normally are one in my process.	O
Are one stands for render one layer, one for rendering a typically do that under the line art.	O
But in this case I'm not trying to say the liner because that's more when it when you're trying to.	O
It's really more about about you trying to save line art.	O
In this case, I don't think the line art is very important.	O
So I'm not afraid of being right above it, you know?	O
Plus if we go over the line are we get some of that richness that's happening from the red.	O
The colours above it are interacting with it and they grey out where they need to and they explode where they need to.	O
So that's kind of nice.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now we're going to create our two and the reason we're going above this hard light.	O
Because we're going to pick colors that are here.	O
See, it's a little out of the gamut.	O
Big colors under here.	O
And paint them in.	O
Nice and clearly.	CHITCHAT
Really define.	O
Horizons here.	O
That there's no mistake of where it ends.	O
The man with the colors here.	O
And a little bit of texture that way.	O
We want to get that rolling feel.	O
A slightly.	O
But it looks.	O
A little bit like a like the form of an actual Hill.	O
Hope you guys are enjoying this.	O
Hope it Sir education.	O
I don't know how much bleed I need, so I'm going to go ahead and just add a little extra there.	O
Excuse me In this, blue is more for the one that's in the background.	O
We're going to go ahead.	O
We need to find this.	O
Edge a little better.	O
Funky angle Summoner build my canvas.	O
There we go.	O
Little hard when you're making up.	O
The look.	O
And a capture of feel feeling right.	O
Using a very light touch, my brush, my brushes set 200% Opacity, 67 percent, 66% good and say that low.	O
And the reason for that is that it gives me just.	O

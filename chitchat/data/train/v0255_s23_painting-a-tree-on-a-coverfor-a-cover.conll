We just drop it back.	O
Like that little Hayes that's happening.	O
And then what we can do is we still selected going to hit command shift C for copy merge so it gets all of it.	O
It paste and so we have everything here, right?	O
And then we could even do a blur.	O
Before we do that, I would like to save because you never know when you're applying filters.	O
You never know if your computers is gonna crash specially.	O
If you have my computer.	O
Anything is possible with God saved.	O
Go to blur Gallery.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It's cool if iris blur.	O
Gonna bring up.	O
Another Dialog box, so to speak.	O
Put this over here.	O
What you do is you can turn up the blur this way.	O
Now go to the edges.	O
Or you could turn it down.	O
And then you can think Smush it or.	O
Or change the shape this way.	O
Does it change the size so it's?	O
Book.	CHITCHAT
The focus in her out that everything in the lenses blurry.	O
Or blurrier towards the center.	O
Less blurry toward the center.	O
Now I get there.	CHITCHAT
In my rotator just for the sake of rotating.	O
I like that.	CHITCHAT
Hey, what's up to?	CHITCHAT
Thanks for stopping by.	CHITCHAT
It's been a little chill stream.	CHITCHAT
It's been a little quiet the last hour, I apologize.	CHITCHAT
And so between that and that.	CHITCHAT
It's not a huge difference.	CHITCHAT
Is this this subtle little thing?	O
To make sure that.	O
Make sure that we can add a little more depth.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
That's one way to do it with a little lens blur Littlefield blur.	O
I think those lens blur.	O
But we bring in a little bit more focus over here towards the center, so that once again we're nice and focus on our tree.	O
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think that might be it for today.	O
Or not today for this session I still want to do another session later tonight.	O
Probably go back to them and instances.	O
Tonight maybe around 8:00.	O
It gives me a 2 hour break.	O
I meant start streaming little earlier today, but you know life.	O
But it is all good, you know.	O
Here's what we're gonna do.	O
We are going to.	CHITCHAT
And emerged that one.	O
And call that light because I don't know what else to call it.	O
You know that blur looks so nice with that blur.	O
It really does.	CHITCHAT
Crab this tree here really quickly and we're going to add.	O
The slightest color slightest hint of color.	O
Country to popular belief trees are not Brown.	O
There sort of a Gray.	O
Gonna drop this in.	O
Just lately.	CHITCHAT
You know we're going to do.	O
We're going to going to select the lines.	O
Select only the tree by the lines.	O

Let me know if you have any work in here.	O
Anything too well yeah, with the word cloud I think would be really cool if it did I had like this.	O
Nice like softer texture to it.	O
Could also be like a lighter color and maybe just have like these little rounder edges steps.	O
I think that's really cool.	CHITCHAT
You could also think about maybe making him almost like Isometric 3D.	O
We can kind of see like going up them at an angle.	O
That would be pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
When it comes to Seattle, so I'm not crazy about how switches over, but I think it does work.	O
I think there could be other solutions about like how to lay this out as well, but overall it's cool.	O
It's really great idea concept.	O
Justin Evans today three from Jane's improvement hopeful letter, can be read clearly this time.	O
So here's one that designs were making, like AT shirt design.	O
You really play with everything.	O
So we actually open original on this side over here, so that way I can really get in there on the details, but really just tuned in and say hello, let me know if you can hear me alright.	O
Everyone is going to see his design chicken chicken.	O
That's exactly what this is, no.	CHITCHAT
So it's a daily.	O
Creative challenges is like what they normally do with Adobe live and I want to review some of the submissions that were going on this past week.	O
Since this week, everyone's off.	O
But also this looks really good when you actually get in on these details.	O
You can start to see the different highlights are like a yellow, blue, red and green.	O
A Jane.	O
Oh cool, I was actually looking at your designed right now.	O
Cool perfect.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I love how sorry so I have it zoomed in over here on my other monitor but I really love how you did the highlights of different colors.	O
I think that looks great.	CHITCHAT
It looks like the shadow like this purple part is a little off from that color and I imagine it's on purpose and it creates like this little like white edge that separates it.	O
Nothing that's really cool.	CHITCHAT
I do of the gradients on this one as well.	O
How you actually go to like a lighter to a purple, you know, but it feels like there's a one gradient here and then it starts from like here is another one.	O
It could be cool for, like maybe each letter was kind of like that, or if there's one from the other, but now these are looking good too.	O
We keep throwing up here.	O
So it looks like on the cover, which I really love this.	O
This is the from the first daily challenge with Claudia from this past week.	O
And is looking, yeah this is really quality texture that's on these.	O
I think it shows up really nicely and light colors.	O
The shadows are good really helps like feel like it's layered.	O
I don't care what throws me off.	O
A little bit is these shapes how they overlap both this one and this one because since you have the shadow on this layer, it makes me feel like there like higher up from each other.	O
And so when this pink one are these ones like overlap that it kind of breaks that for me.	O
You know 'cause I feel like.	O
It loses some of that like layered feelings.	O
Yeah no prob.	CHITCHAT
Gen 2 let me know if there's any other work around here to they want to check out.	O
'cause right now I'm really just trying to get caught up as well.	O
And some of these design some really cool stuff, so this looks like it was from the previous challenges, which was like Hawks kitchen for Andrew Luck rental.	O
And the whole thing was like a cooking theme which is really dope.	O
So one of the days they had to make a menu and let's get in here and look at some of these details.	O
Let me actually download this image of here on my other monitor just so I can really look at this one as well.	O
Who is the 2nd?	O
Maybe bring it up here if that works or not.	O
Cool so yeah, we like the wood texture.	O
I think the text gets a little close to the edges over here so it could be nice if you brother didn't have little more padding and like some breathing room.	O
The typeface is cool but it's standing out to me that it's in like all caps.	O
So then like the two words kind of start to blend together in a way like the space between the seat and the S is really big.	O
See the process, but it's like just as big as the space between the SDK.	O
Which makes me think that it's like Jane S kitchen, or at all, kind of like blends together as one word so it could be cool to play with the spacing.	O
That.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe it's like if it's mixed case, you know, like not all capitalized.	O
So yeah, this is dollar sign right here is like a little bit larger than the other ones, so just make sure they're consistent.	O
I would also.	CHITCHAT
It's really what helps me.	CHITCHAT
A lot is kind of like a grid system and lay like lines to help like make sure everything is aligned.	O
You can see right?	CHITCHAT
Actually I'm kind of blocking it from my head, the potato soup and steak and then spaghetti and coffee.	O
It would be nice if all of those are kind of sitting on like the same line like across so it feels more like organizing that way.	O
I think he started to do it right here, 'cause I see that dollar sign is like a little.	O
Is a little bigger, so maybe make I don't.	O
I could work to also make like all of the price is like a larger typeface or amino larger like size.	O

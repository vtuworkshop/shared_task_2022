Yeah, because I like how like the titles in larger and these are smaller 'cause it makes sense, but everything is going on.	O
It's cool.	CHITCHAT
The Popsicle sticks look good as well.	O
I think this might be a little thicker.	O
Maybe try just having one of 'em like duplicating the same one and then just changing the colors like textures and stuff like that.	O
But like these images look like they're on the would they be could be scaled up a little bit just to give yourself more room to highlight what's on this menu.	O
But also I can understand exactly how it's going to work.	O
Like a flipbook, you know, cool.	O
Kill me actually.	CHITCHAT
Hide that window and go back to the discord.	O
Everyone in the chat and as part of this let me know if you have any work they want me to check out too, so I'm just kind of going through this in the most recent ones so.	O
Yes, we are very much appreciated.	O
Keep busy with it.	O
Nice so this is from the first one from the first daily challenge of this past week with Claudia.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and I love how the Texans really come out when he starts showing these layers.	O
It really starts to look like realistic like paper is stacked on top of each other, which is really dope.	O
I love this color in the typeface you're using.	O
I think it's like a lot of personality and works with the colored.	O
It's also nice to see that's close to that thickness.	O
Maybe these shapes could really be closer to reflect the typeface so it kind of feels little connected in that way, so that could be cool.	O
But it is really cool.	CHITCHAT
I'll just play with Photoshop blur effects in illustrator.	O
World without chocolate is half.	O
Nice.	CHITCHAT
See I like I can kinda see like the edges.	O
They feel like it's little layered from it.	O
And yeah don't have just like one solid color you have like, some nice like splotches in there to help them feel realistic.	O
These typefaces, your parents are really nice too.	O
I like that chocolate is like a script.	O
The typeface, while the other ones are like, varies like San Serif.	O
I think they fit together very nicely.	O
You probably don't need that underlying this blue chocolate, maybe even scale up the word chocolate, or do it like mixed case, where it's like the first sees capitalized in the breasts are like regular case.	O
No, yeah, I think it's cool.	CHITCHAT
It's looking good.	CHITCHAT
I like the droplets are flying through the Sky right flying through this like movement going on with it so it's cool.	O
Yeah, let's look at who's a Ortiz.	O
So let me check this out on my secondary monitor and then bring it over in just a second.	O
So here is a Guadalupe Ortiz will follow.	O
Let's check this one out untapped society.	O
So I think yeah, this typefaces work well together.	O
Going with like the thin one in the very thick one.	O
Uhm, nice on the colours and this texture that's in the background is very nice.	O
It's kind of hard to maybe see it on the stream.	O
Cool, so you're showing us like how the brain is actually used on the monitoring Salat Times up to homepage website is going to be like where a lot of train assets are actually used so illustrations are cool.	O
The colors look really nice.	O
I think the navigation like everything makes sense like a good website like the core elements appear.	O
Login so OK so these aren't just the calories that's part of the actual load in said something to keep in mind.	O
Just second, let me check something over here.	CHITCHAT
Jasons gonna see you then.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I got printed chat.	O
Snapchat me, uh so yeah I really like how you doing with get connected with resources and you really like using keywords and bold and I think that's a smart decision.	O
It could be cool too if you really know how to do this.	O
To actually animate this as well, to maybe show what the rest of that home page kind of looks like when you Scroll down.	O
It would be really cool.	CHITCHAT
No, yeah, you show the same text right here how you did it.	O
Which I don't know if we need necessarily need this section right here to be honest, since you're really showing it right here, I think that's enough to just show like how it's working.	O
A main color is nice.	O
I like that you send the texture on top of Maine colors.	O
Works well, additional colors so you have a lot of colors.	O
So but OK, I see that you're actually using in the illustration styles.	O
So nice, this also look like what's shown on the website, like right there at the bottom.	O
So I'll see if you're showing these.	O
I would show the same illustration too.	O
I'll maybe show like another illustration or another way.	O
We kind of using the brand.	O
I think that would be really cool way to help highlight it.	O
Now this is really cool mark.	CHITCHAT
It's very interesting, so when you have very sharp angles like this, it makes me feel more like aggressive versus like.	O
The handshake is very like peaceful and you can almost see like already like a heart kind of happening in the handshake.	O
So I think there's a lot of contrast in going on here and it's the vibe is lending a helping hand.	O
Maybe using one rounded shapes would help.	O
Kind of like communicate that versus like you know the very hard like points.	O
So this is cool.	CHITCHAT
You're using the same like style, but you also, um, showing like how you do the same bold words.	O
Now some more the website pages.	O
Now like other laid over each other, if you really want to go, take a next level.	O

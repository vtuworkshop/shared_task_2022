You can think about breaking into ex.	O
Dean Kamen making like an interactive version.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Are you nice?	CHITCHAT
I do like that one's in blue.	O
I think that works well.	CHITCHAT
It sounds good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like that, you're changing the color of the like this type in here it really breaks up with different quotes inside everything.	O
Let me just check the stream quality over here for just a second.	CHITCHAT
Let me make sure everything's good.	CHITCHAT
There we go, so Scroll down through there.	O
I really like the purple one as well.	O
Nice, I think it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's really like well built out like case.	O
They do highlight this.	O
I think this could be pushed further attention, like more ways using the illustrations and stuff.	O
Yes, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Let me go and bring that monitor over.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back into discord.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if the audio is too loud, you think just cranked up my ears a little bit.	CHITCHAT
So teacher mark up last week challenge three is graphic design exercise.	O
Cool see yes, let's click on this link.	O
These details in here, right?	O
So the typeface is really fun.	O
I like the colors.	O
It works well, feels very like bubbly, especially since at the very light like rainbow colors with these little highlights in the round edges thing that works very nice, but then the background too.	O
With like this texture almost reminds me of like a fence or something.	O
And then with the black and white like the grey feels almost like not aggressive in a way, but it does kind of contrast like the text so there could be another way to actually make like more of like a playful background.	O
That kind of works with this type style.	O
I think if you put a little further, yeah.	O
So this cool image shown.	O
Actually, you're saying it's from a shirt, like a Derby, so I'm guessing it's like Roller Derby, which makes sense if you do want like aggressive, you know at some point where it's like the pink, the netting style.	O
Nothing that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'd be really cool to see if this is for like dirty to show, kind of like some of the other assets they might use like some other ways.	O
You can use it.	O
Let's check out please Jesse Z.	O
So I'm gonna open this up and actually get it back and look at the details.	O
Just II is bringing this up here and less plus that up a little bit.	O
Let me check something over here.	O
She was still good quality wise.	O
Cool so nice.	CHITCHAT
I see Joey stop over there so I'm guessing it's probably like a logo mark that you got from there.	O
Yeah no, this yes.	CHITCHAT
He looks very nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, look at all this for 2nd.	O
See I wouldn't really love to be kind of further.	O
It seems like it is like a lot of like stock assets can combine, and so I'd really love to see how you can use these stock assets and kind of like take it to the next level.	O
You know this could start to pick the colors from these illustrations, but then yeah, I'd really love to see more of what you're trying to show, which now I'm guessing this one.	O
The challenge was about building a case study and a lot of times if you don't have a lot of work yourself, you know it's good to kind of practice and follow along and show how you lay stuff out.	O
So yeah, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Let me bring that monitor that window over for just a second.	O
Let me check this over here.	O
Nice.	CHITCHAT
Still keep checking stuff out.	O
Sweet, let me open this up over here.	O
I remember seeing this one as it came in.	O
So let's go command plus and let's just start zoom in in a bunch, look at the details so he actually just check out who was.	O
Again, well, you know that's nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I remember seeing this one as it came in before.	O
So yeah, this is really cool.	CHITCHAT
Mark 'cause you're kind of like a yoga mind body soul, less like a yoga studio or like a yoga type brand.	O
Or maybe yoga teacher.	O
Pursuing the typefaces work well.	O
You got the thicker one of top like these other ones down here and this how it actually starts to create.	O
Like a person kind of doing yoga.	O
I think that's really cool touch.	O
And no, that's probably only yoga balls, maybe so I think it could be pushed over.	O
There may be showing like.	O
Yeah, I'm not sure how exactly do, but I think it's really cool idea, but maybe like the black filled circle.	O
I think for the oh really stands out the meeting, so maybe there's another way to pull it off too.	O
Yes, I think this really cool way to show kind of how do you use the typography and layout?	O

The design?	O
I think it looks nice, maybe see you have like this dinner one is doing in this in the thicker one maybe maybe you have like these like contrast.	O
Little maybe 1 should be thicker, one should be thin or something.	O
Nice, I think this choir show the business card.	O
It's like with the leaf in the background makes a lot of sense.	O
Things cool context for it.	O
You got all these lines that we kind of pointing to it so it works very well.	O
Plus this shape kind of sex are reflected leave.	O
I think this business card that starts to look pixelated so I would go in and maybe like re link it if it was like a mock up or just like re dropping in on the right size or something.	O
Please just music here for a second.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
This is why I love how you break up the images to show him like text in there.	O
Actually, on the shirt, like when I see it like this, I can definitely imagine this as like a yoga brand.	O
It works very well.	O
Places like the green makes sense too, since, like growth and symbolize lot stuff like that, so let's bring that one over.	O
Let's keep moving forward.	CHITCHAT
Just check out some of these.	O
So, working on last week's Challenge is just for fun, nice.	O
So this one was for like playing with type and trying to make like word art through the Typography.	O
So yeah, progress through actions.	O
I think this looks good to start to show like OK so go in and it's like progress is like almost like like snapping back in like boom.	O
I think there could be shown a little more and maybe progress isn't the best word for that too.	O
Maybe it's like snapper like come?	CHITCHAT
Hello, I think it's really cool concept.	CHITCHAT
Yeah maybe they played with a little bit typefaces font to use.	O
I think that's already like a trippy like wonky typeface.	O
Progress through action, I would just make sure that through is like centered in the actual image too.	O
And then this going around there I think works well.	O
You start to lose some of legibility, but it works.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Say for business card revise, drop shadow behind him so.	O
Please OK.	CHITCHAT
So at first glance I wonder if this text right here might be a little stretched.	O
I'm not positive if it is.	O
But it just seems like this might be like a little bit pixelated or something.	O
I like the shape stories in the background, like this white with pink and dumb.	O
Having ever looks really good.	O
I think the black shape really stands out a lot of contrast along with the other colors, so maybe you'd like a lighter color like it makes sense to have your text like black or dark color to really stand out so you can see the info.	O
But yeah, maybe that's something you could play with a little bit.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So that was Jane as well, yeah?	O
Yes, I think really just these black shapes is what draws my attention in like a lot and it kind of like captures me immediately, whereas maybe you could bring it like another color that could work as well.	O
And since you have this market already without the blank phone, like maybe even just show like how the home page of the website will look or something if you're going to like display it this way.	O
It could be cool just taking next level or even just like the logo like act like it's loading screen or something.	O
This is an AI file to skip down, just don't want to download their AI file.	O
Yeah, ideally challenge day for from this past week.	O
So business card.	O
Let's check this one out.	CHITCHAT
This is from Jose Ortiz.	CHITCHAT
Thanks so yeah layout you like your text looks very professional.	CHITCHAT
The way you have it, the name being like bold works well with the title blow it you got the icons.	O
Social media right there.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think this looks good.	CHITCHAT
Hum, maybe that could be brought over.	O
There could be something like that space that could be utilized.	O
Like maybe this web pattern kind of gets brought over more and it's like very transparent towards like.	O
Hard to see.	O
But I think overall is really cool.	O
I think this word mark right here is very interesting too, that I go and it's got like all the very big swirls going.	O
I think it stands out loud because it's like reflective.	O
So I wonder if it's going to be like foil pressed so it is I just make sure stuff like that just want to talk with your printer 1st and kind of know how they like to deal with stuff like that.	O
But I think this was like you know.	O
Yeah, for press would be really cool.	CHITCHAT
Looks really classy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no, it's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I should be given all these like thumbs up to.	O
So daily challenge 4 hour.	O
Learning how to make complex shapes easy.	O
Awesome.	CHITCHAT
So I'm gonna open the original just to.	O
Wish I can zoom in there so I think whenever this file got past him to have been like 72 DPI or something.	O
So a lot of people didn't exported the right size.	O
But yes, broken typeface.	O
It's kind of hard to tell.	O
Gonna look super blurry, but it's got these like serifs that kind of been down a little bit, which I think looks really cool and like these colors for like this reddish on this yellow.	O
I think it works really well.	O
Just like immediately points in there.	O
Yeah, this is really cool.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of like action.	O
It almost reminds me of like people get enough circus, but like karneval like those vintage like style like that.	O

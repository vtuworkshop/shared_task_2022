Especially with these lettering too.	O
I can imagine like.	O
Yeah, it written like that.	O
Not super cool.	CHITCHAT
Let me bring this back over here.	O
Minimize that, we bring this over.	O
Listen showed it like on the screen, right?	O
There was a screenshot of.	O
It's a lot of times people may not know how to export its data files to.	O
Nothing is really cool.	CHITCHAT
If this is for a logo to think about, like the text size is very small.	O
So like this is by the smallest you'll ever be able to make it.	O
You know it would be.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll just be very careful about like your text size.	O
Does it make sure like your text is very clear and sometimes with logos too.	O
Less is more, so if you can minimize the amount of calories I think it goes along way.	O
Well, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
No, Jane again, awesome.	CHITCHAT
This is this one, so this is some like talking with tax.	O
Basically where you had to kind of make the text into like the word.	O
So yeah, love was the one that we all did together and like I think that came out really nice.	O
You're applying also stuff.	O
We learned a lesson before, which is like how to like layer.	O
These are the shadows.	O
I think it's dope textures.	CHITCHAT
The really nice.	CHITCHAT
It's cool how you actually have these shadows from the words like going on like this moon in the background.	O
I think it works well just drop Shadow and I'm really highlights it with from this.	O
Yes, that is really interesting.	O
Looks like you're really playing with it and runs like shadow, like something like from a video game maybe, but like how you have the light actually hitting, this works really well.	O
I'm like he tells like shining through right there.	O
So yeah things though.	O
She got this one.	O
Let me open the original just so I can zoom in.	O
You bring this over here.	O
If it wasn't a chat, soon was submitted anything and wants to get any feedback to please let me know and I'll just bounce around.	O
But your muscles work my way around through it let me.	O
I'm taking a break for just a second.	CHITCHAT
Let me double check the quality of stuff over here.	CHITCHAT
I think a lot of other windows open.	CHITCHAT
Do that for just a second.	CHITCHAT
It looks like we're good, cool, uh, so for this one.	CHITCHAT
Yes, there's a whole case study for last week challenges with I Claudius, that's awesome.	O
Caesar cover one.	O
Yeah, it's where you're playing like the layers like the shadows do.	O
Those things looks nice see the glow effect around the bulb works well shapes like do not like framing natural text.	O
So we've been amazed after second.	O
So I think although the fact that she by continued somehow I feel like continuing on this image.	O
I just have like softer edge or maybe into little before 'cause this was fine.	O
Seems that corner, but since this like continues it would.	O
It would be cool to see how these like flow from one to the other without like having like a breaking point.	O
Especially.	O
Especially, this is our on like one like a long ribbon now like it could be cool dad just really think about how this interact with each other.	O
Yeah, talk with types nice.	O
Yeah, we're brakes are literally breaking the word.	O
You know it makes sense that you showing around like the dash line to just like highlight which word it is.	O
I think it could help you with the word break, like it was split like kind of where it was like touched.	O
You know like where the word letters would normally be in like.	O
Those are like this.	O
Spots that are kind of like broken.	O
I think I can help them make sense.	O
You know, if you have any questions about what I mean about anything to feel free to message me and I'll review like your personal work as well.	O
Set T shirt slogan.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Yes, so I do think that these goal posts the edges, so we're dealing with like T shirt designs.	O
You want to make sure that like there's a certain safe space that can print in without like it getting warped are messed up, so you have to bring that in just a little bit.	O
Also think about like where it's going to go on a person.	O
That would be kind of low.	O
Yeah, this business card yes OK I love how you doing these shapes.	O
How is really like almost like paint and it starts breaking like these triangles.	O
I think that's really cool.	CHITCHAT
I would just be careful with that text on that because that's going to be tough to come out like printed.	O
Very how these colors are interacting is really cool.	O
How does even see like that push more unlike some of the other designs as well?	O
The colour palette nice.	O
I like how you sing it in Chiefs not just like circles like squares or something but actually showing like how it be.	O
Yeah, it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's check out.	CHITCHAT
Let's see who that was, again.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we know awesome.	CHITCHAT
The designs that Jack and I reviewed yesterday in the portfolio reviews part.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Which let me double check with.	O
This was again.	O
Kris Kringle, Nice?	CHITCHAT
We have just over this like his quickly 'cause we did.	O

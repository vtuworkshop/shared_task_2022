Chris is yesterday so yeah, I loved how the texture came out on this.	O
It feels very rusted and how using like footprints delete across in those smart.	O
This one was really cool.	CHITCHAT
How you liking perspective?	O
Nothing else really smart with like the popcorn like the blue and orange together work really well.	O
Split is kind of like similar to what we were just looking at.	O
Second you like break.	O
I think you do a great job with that.	O
One of the things we talked about was like maybe getting rid of the stroke from the inside where it looks like the word was like split from where it's you know like interacting.	O
Yeah, with these ones we talked about this is like AT shirt design to think about too how thin you go with certain colors because it gets very tough to deal with printing when you have like very small shapes as well.	O
But I think these are looking great.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and these are also two.	CHITCHAT
We also talked about like how like the V right here that to me seems like a little tough.	O
I don't know what the word was.	O
It maybe it's kind of tough to understand what it was.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but don't really awesome stuff.	CHITCHAT
Awesome, there's a teacher for black lives matter now 'cause you BLM?	O
I think that works well.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that end is very wide too, so maybe even think about if there is possible to have mall like horizontal but we do want to vertical, you know just.	O
It made me think about how these shapes can interact.	O
Just do that.	CHITCHAT
Em is a lot wider than the VNL.	O
This looks really cool.	CHITCHAT
Other taxes actually interacting with like the hair.	O
I would maybe think about if you could bring it down to like less colors as well.	O
Depending on the printing process you do.	O
If you could get it to be just like you know where that like light blue light cyan color with like 1 orange then I think it would save you a lot of like even money just getting the printed.	O
You could even get like this lighter color but maybe doing like halftones or like a different type of shading to use the same color but still get like a lighter shade of it.	O
And then also about shirts two, we know some small ships Michael off, so just want to play it safe, but yeah.	O
That's really cool.	CHITCHAT
Well, that cover Chicago, Ella Watch.	O
Please do this.	CHITCHAT
Just second, let me get that to load.	O
Cool, looks good, so let's bring this over.	O
Yeah, Lindsay, Watch.	CHITCHAT
Getting the metal like the submit texture looks really good blue.	O
Yeah he started to see how these have the shadows and they really feel like layered.	O
What throws me off is then it goes back to this one and it feels like this is like a lower than these.	O
So maybe like this blue should be like the border of like this section.	O
If not, maybe find a way to make this feel like raised above it.	O
I think the text looks great, even think about like getting the dates to be able to order 'cause I don't think you need to add 2020 on both phones.	O
I'm sorry, excuse me.	CHITCHAT
Nice.	CHITCHAT
How do you think?	CHITCHAT
Maybe consider lightning the background a little bit?	O
Maybe like adding with transparency to this black color so that we can kind of, or maybe even seeing how you can get like the texture to go on top of that as well.	O
He said have a glorious, so I think that helps it stand out.	O
But yeah, right here how you actually showing the texture through that.	O
I love how that's interacting with excess.	O
Feels like it's actually like on that wall and I wonder if you have this way to do that with this which you started to do.	O
But then the glow effect I think, takes it away from that a little bit so.	O
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, discovery, I think it looks really nice.	O
I love.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this texture right here and this green how they interact with each other.	O
It seems like a blend modes kind of illustrator daily challenge.	O
Yeah, I'm usually not a fan of how like texting it.	O
Kind of like slice in half and you have like effects changing, but I think this actually works pretty well and the layers of shapes like the waves almost.	O
Like this, type space is very different than what you're doing here, which may be like contracts.	O
Interface works, but then also on the other designs that might be part of the same challenge using different typefaces.	O
So I would recommend maybe if you're going to do like a full set of challenges, maybe try to do them all with like the same type pairing and so that way it feels like a brand from each when you go to when you look back the whole week they all kind of feel connected in a way.	O
But he's like another version of that as well.	O
Yes, I think this is really quite like that.	O
Colours reminds me of.	O
Like an arcade or something.	O
This is like magical.	O
Especially with this typeface to how it has like these little extras on the edges.	O
Please.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it's good.	CHITCHAT
About how close it is, the edges of the T shirt and also the sun right here, I think that's going to be tough to actually like print on a T-shirt.	O

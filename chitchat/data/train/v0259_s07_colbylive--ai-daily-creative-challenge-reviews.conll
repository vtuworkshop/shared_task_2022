It's going to look like the type of printing that you're able to do.	O
What is oranges?	O
and I read this is like.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe ranges, so yeah, even right there too.	O
There's also, I don't know if it's supposed to read his oranges or ranges, so think about just wanted to be like as clear as possible.	O
Yeah, see, someone said that.	O
Let's you watch as.	O
Please let me watch watch watch photography.	O
I'm yeah, I'm curious to if you actually have the domain name, watch photography.	O
That seems like a pretty solid one to have.	O
Oh, let me mess with my green screen setting for a second.	O
It looks like my T shirt over here is open out.	O
Just a little bit.	O
Yeah, just a second.	CHITCHAT
Do this.	CHITCHAT
No, actually I want this camera let me.	O
Adjust the filter of it going to Chroma Key.	O
Please bring up down just a little bit.	O
They only switch seems right there, so you might have notice it, but hopefully it helps.	O
I guess now it's a little more green around, like my hair and stuff, but I think that will help me to disappear.	O
When is school?	O
So yeah, this is we talked about you, so you're looking for watch it ography.	O
I think watch with the script typeface speculative to read, especially you scale it down anymore than this.	O
Uhm, I do have the shapes that you actually use in the background like this is hebra stripes and the how it blends in there.	O
I think that looks really nice.	CHITCHAT
Look very classy style to it.	CHITCHAT
That I PCs are using the same types from the last image, which is awesome.	O
But then yeah this down here is like a regular one, like amora body copy but then on.	O
This is this is on you starting to use something like this out.	O
Maybe use that other body copy that you're using.	O
In this.	CHITCHAT
Image on that, but for those dates on this one that should.	O
I think the colors look nice.	O
We go, we bring this over for a second.	O
You going to check something?	O
Go see let me bring discord back over.	O
Let me go back to where was really fast.	O
If it was turned into it has anything with him once he or.	O
Or as many challenges will, while back wants to be reviewed, please just let me know your name Alvin like search it specifically.	O
Yes, yes, so I think we're right here.	O
Yeah, there's some buddies in, um, just face a lot too.	O
So awesome, let me actually just double check it really fast.	O
Yeah, looks good.	O
Something bring this over.	O
So coffee and Co branding also.	O
This is like the show at the main cover image, such as logo on like the coffee beans background which I do love to actually see it like on a background image.	O
I think that goes like really cool.	O
I would say this text.	O
This text is good but then once you start getting testy in 2020 in this text that goes around here that you really start to lose that when you're showing it.	O
Like on that type of background.	O
Even it might just even be like a little small.	O
I would say if you can get rid of like two or three words and just have it to be like 3 or 4 words at most or something and scaling up a little bit.	O
Similarly ST2020, yeah, that really gets lost in the edges.	O
I think maybe scaling it up a little bit.	O
Type this for the coffee and company.	O
I think it works really well.	O
It looks like also the STM 20s like underlying.	O
You may not need that in the stars.	O
Yeah, I'll just play with like how this part of it interacts with its little bit.	O
I also think about how the text is right here.	O
Maybe going into type on a path like flipping it because I feel like I want to see like it start from here and you read it over versus.	O
It's something like there on the bottom part.	O
Yeah, I like how you showed this to, so you'd like the main like word mark on the left side with actual compass spills over into coffee beans.	O
I think it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
Uh, maybe think about this text right here so allow people may have like visual Accessibility problems that may be typical difficult for them to see some colors on other colors, so I would go and give that maybe like an Accessibility test for like color impairment to see how that may look for people with different types of color blindness.	O
Yeah, I think is really cool.	CHITCHAT
I have this.	CHITCHAT
Would be really cool, which would be kind of figure out how-to-do-it necessarily, but like having the top of this coffee shape kind of somehow make like your logo design so we could have that on their tours.	O

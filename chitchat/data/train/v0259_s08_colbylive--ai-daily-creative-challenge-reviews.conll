Like somehow they can pour like the cream or however into to do that design.	O
That would be really crazy.	CHITCHAT
This is so you have business cards here.	O
Yeah, like all these different versions of them as well.	O
I think that works well.	CHITCHAT
Ooh and yeah, this pattern that you made out of like that center logo design looks really good.	O
Yeah, I really can't that's being used.	O
Nice yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just let me finish this one.	CHITCHAT
I'll check yours out.	CHITCHAT
Give me just a second.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, so I'm just bringing yours up over on the other window for a second.	O
Let me try to link one more time.	O
We do right here in the surgeon it.	O
I'm having trouble with that link you just share with Maine.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let me try something else with fast.	O
Yeah, sorry boss, just a moment.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, that leak your posted wasn't let me actually go to that project and then also click on your profile.	O
it is I don't see projects there so I would just suggest making sure that it's not saved as a draft and that it may be saved as like a published project on your portfolio.	O
And then maybe the link will actually let me like connect to it.	O
But no, yeah, thank you for sharing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah there's like another linking submitted to let me know that wasn't working.	O
A party checks.	O
You've got a great balance between being enthusiasm and liking everyones work, but then giving solid feedback to make it better.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
That means alot now, I really appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
'cause sometimes, like when I lived in projects, I don't necessarily know what I'm going to.	O
Yeah, you don't really know when to start looking at it and started trying to like rap your brain around how that system is going to work but no thank you very much.	O
That means alot.	CHITCHAT
That's really sweet.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yes, let's get down.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, sorry left off the business cards.	O
And yeah, the pattern was a really nice addition to it.	O
Maybe it's kind of tough to tell, but it might be a stroke around different parts of this.	O
Patterns, like right there, let me get back into zoom in a little bit.	O
OK, hold on a second.	CHITCHAT
Let Maine.	O
Try way to zoom in even more.	O
Yeah, so that one I think works well.	O
Let me go over to where it's like over here.	O
Who has a darker shade when I get close?	O
I think it's fine.	CHITCHAT
Um, there may be a lot of difficulty actually printing these cards.	O
When I see that there's like very tiny shapes that might get lost.	O
Things like printing process you do think about that as well.	O
We zoom out a little bit and see how it looks from distance.	O
Yeah, I think there may be like with this pattern.	O
It may be a little tough with some of these shapes to actually get printed, so let's keep that in mind and think about like what the smallest size is that you can actually like print.	O
That we'll need to go back to the whole project.	O
I think it's cool like showing how it's.	O
Show me how it's like island on white.	O
Yeah, like that, you start to show like how people like almost like map out logos.	O
But I think that could be maybe played with just a little bit.	O
'cause I think if you're going to show it like mapped out like a grid or graft outweigh, I think you'd really want to push that far and like show how like all of its kind of mapped out something.	O
If there is a good example of someone had that could think of that does that.	O
I can show you what I mean.	O
Yeah, I can think of doing it on my head.	O
Sorry about it all the time where people actually shoulder logos and they show like how a grid or how it fits up with like like mathematically.	O
So I like that you're doing that.	O
I would just yet maybe recommend even push that further and logo symbolism nice so circles for the Cup of coffee from the top view, OK?	O
Sorry, I didn't get that initially.	O
I can see we're coming from without the circle works.	O
I think if you're going to the circle, maybe actually have the handle that comes off of the sides and maybe that's where like EST or established there like 20 or something.	O
Since like on the handle.	O
Um plus leaves origin of coffee cool.	O
So I'm not sure what the coffee leads actually look like.	O
Whether it's like this or like that.	O
But I was saying maybe if there is a way to kind of show like.	O
That sheep like both times, you know like it helps with people more connected to these lips look different, and so it's like that leaf is supposed to symbolize that leaf.	O
I don't know which one is like the accurate one.	O
In the star blend of perfection.	O
No, I love how you actually showing how it's like added.	O

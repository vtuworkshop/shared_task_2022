Like you're adding these up to make a logo.	O
Mark that thing that really stands out to me is when you have like a mark.	O
That means more than one thing because that's like a pet peeve of mine to someones has like.	O
Don't wanna like talk bad about it?	O
Let's try to think of something like if you do coffee now, I should say it.	O
If you can do an organization, but the ocean and all you have is like you know, wave or something.	O
You know it's like not as great, but if you can find another way to like.	O
Combine multiple symbols.	O
I think goes along way.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yes, so packages.	O
And yeah, you really showing this pattern again, which I think looks really good and it kind of looks very like professional so I can see.	O
Yeah these all feel very connected and I love that actually showing like taking the next level showing these like mopped up.	O
And like how this type actually works.	O
Yeah, looks great.	CHITCHAT
I would be curious to so if you have more than two flavors of coffee.	O
If you're going to introduce other colors or if it's going to be multiple copies that are like this same color, you know whether it's just for bus to, or if it's like.	O
Maybe there's like 3 flavors that are discounted freedom that color it may get difficult when you're in a store and it's like you may grab the wrong kind of coffee or something.	O
So think about that.	CHITCHAT
So you trying to stick with those two main calories, but maybe that limits you just two different flavors of coffee.	O
If this is kind of the way you're going about like communicating it.	O
This is been eseverri like classy as well.	O
Yeah, this pattern works really well with the design.	O
I think that helps a lot.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and see it's my question, right?	O
And so you're showing other colors.	O
Cool, OK, uhm.	CHITCHAT
It looks like these are planted with Adobe Dimension defined to guess.	O
Feels like they're rendered 3D models.	O
So yeah, when I started and that's the tough part with this too.	O
When I start to see the package in these other colors, it feels very disconnected from these because all these are these two colors and I think that works really well.	O
But then when I start to see these colors you start just feel yeah very different and then you start to run different problems where it's like it was like colored background in this text is a little tougher to show up.	O
Same with that.	O
Then we run the problem with the bottom logo.	O
How you really can't see that text.	O
And sending right here that legibility seem very tough with the store.	O
Like besides, though, I think that looks nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think these colours would be need to be played with a little more.	O
I wonder if like you need to add in like other additional brand colors so you have like these two main colors, but then maybe have like you know pallet of like six other colors that work well with it that they just kind of uses secondary ones and he started do that here.	O
But I think these colors feel very different than the other ones.	O
I think the sides are in a great sorry and like the layout and how you just changing the colors make sense, but I think the colors here necessarily work to be honest.	O
Yes, right here that text is very tough to read.	O
Yeah, and then just the text in the bond movies last.	O
I think you have too many renders of these as well.	O
When you showing this, 'cause I can kind of imagine how these angles look since I've seen other ones.	O
Yeah, I think maybe just like one image of each of these would be good to really show.	O
Like, well rounded.	CHITCHAT
Maybe pick like each color and have like like maybe one of 'em?	O
Is this angle another one like this angle and you kinda like lead us through it so that way each image kind of shows something that's like interesting and new.	O
Yeah, I like how you showing all them side by side.	O
Yes, I do think they do not seem like this.	O
I think it's too soon to feel connected.	O
Maybe the colour should be a little better, but these two feel like the main ones.	O
Yeah, I just think some of these colors, like the legibility, is in Super Strong.	O
But I think the overall if they looked really good now that they're rendered 3D, I think that's really cool.	O
Maybe you don't add additional flavors.	O
Maybe it's just like, uhm, caffeinated in decaf or something to play save.	O
But nothing else.	O
It's like really like it's a very detailed project and I love that.	O
Yeah, specially up here.	O
I love how you actually laying down, laying out the entire brand.	O
Getting down here, it turns into a lot of this, like repeating kind of similar vendors.	O
So maybe just a little bit.	O
Yeah, I think it's real.	CHITCHAT
We minimize that out of the way.	O
Tell Maine open this one over here and check it out.	O
Sweet, let me bring this over.	O
Minimize this, so yeah, so this from last week series of challenges with Claudius is super dope.	O
So it looks like this little spot right there are maybe just make sure that's filled in is probably just something like when you look at it, but you just kind of misses details.	O

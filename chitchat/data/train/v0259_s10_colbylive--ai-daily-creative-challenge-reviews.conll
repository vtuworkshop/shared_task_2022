Look at the green screen around my hand.	O
It's kind of weird.	CHITCHAT
I got this in the settings.	O
Yeah, texture on this colors are really cool.	O
In a little bit actually showing day one, you're laying out like very clearly OK this day one, did you?	O
It's like we're doing all these things.	O
OK, I see what's going on now so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, he's like two different versions of it as well, with a little bit of like inner like Shadow and hear the ones where it's like a really feel.	O
So expect to be layered.	O
It's also maybe takedown the shadows just a little bit, because I think this might be a little too thick when he starts to get inside the text it.	O
That's kind of like, Oh, I see the shadows on the text.	O
But it does really look like it is like stacked on top of each other, which is really cool.	O
Thanks ily melting the word melt, supercool.	O
I think the colors look nice.	O
They're very like a light colors and it works well.	O
So just try to get lined up perfectly.	O
It's not like this like waviness, it's melting.	O
Say something about you.	O
It's like a blue red color and blue is usually representing a cool like a cold color.	O
So maybe those melting.	O
You'd want to show something like warm like hot like that.	O
In balance, nice.	O
Yeah, but that's like actually going right there.	O
It feels very like it's like one way or the other.	O
I'm curious about the oh right there.	O
Yeah, I'm just curious.	O
I don't understand that's why that was there specifically, so I'd be curious to see like what would you like.	O
Was like the idea behind including that as well vegan.	O
Nice so you're doing like inside the shape of the avocado.	O
Super cool.	CHITCHAT
Please I want to because usually avocado thing is like Brown color I think so maybe you want to have that be like the Brown color.	O
Do you have just gone blank?	O
But I think it's like the darker color so maybe yeah, word vegans should be like that darker color.	O
This is from the two.	O
Yeah, black lives matter is awesome.	O
Yeah, I think the shadows on here like having this offset looks really good.	O
Yeah, like I think the you could jump with the lighting I would say think about you where the actual highlights kind of our 'cause some of them are like this left side with somebody on the right side and these other ones don't have it so I would just make sure whatever you're doing that it's like feels like it's coming from like the same angle.	O
I think this is really good.	CHITCHAT
I love how it's like super like monkey edges.	O
Yeah, like the colours looks really dope and how you actually put it on like a statue other than super fun cool.	O
Bring this over here on the exit out of that.	O
Let me double check something over here in the sun.	O
Fisher is still good to stream quality and if it was just turned in they smell anything.	O
Please let me know and I'll be sure to check it out.	O
So check out some of the actual business card designs from challenge 4th.	O
This is the shapes are looking really great how it's actually like leading you to the M&AZI think it's super cool and this typeface to this in is really sweet.	O
How like loops around and does that with a ZI?	O
Think that Z fits really nicely like in the corner of that M so that works really well.	O
Mega Zoom Creative Company cool.	O
Setting is nice of the credit company starts like behind that.	O
G maybe could be brought up a little bit.	O
I really do like this magazine with typeface.	O
They're using their.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
It looks like creative company is a different typeface in this body copy one that just started.	O
Feel like maybe there's too many that are happening on this.	O
I get this is part of like a logo and this is part of the actual body copy, but maybe there's a way to play with that and open feel like a little more connected as well.	O
And I would actually make up like a street name and stuff too.	O
So it feels like more real.	O
Because you may end up with like a much longer address in that or something.	O
The end of the shapes, the background create like really cool like effect it's going on.	O
Yeah also.	CHITCHAT
But I'll watch again.	O
Let's check this out, let me.	CHITCHAT
Download it maybe.	O
She's not giving option downloaded this odd.	O
Did you see those preview?	O
Let's see if I can bring it up in just a second.	O
OK, here we go.	CHITCHAT
We should be opening it.	O
And then let me see if I can zoom in on some of these details.	O
Honestly though, so yeah, I would make sure you're like a high quality.	O
I think we did look at this kind of in like your Behance page as well so I think it's the same projects but I do like how you started out.	O

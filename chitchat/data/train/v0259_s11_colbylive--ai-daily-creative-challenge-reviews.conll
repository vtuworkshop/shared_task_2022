Nicely.	CHITCHAT
Really open original.	O
Going to do this.	CHITCHAT
Your boom, let's check this out.	CHITCHAT
So I'll just make sure that you don't stretch images, so that's something you want to be really careful about, like how it's just pixelated so that way when you export it like you don't end up like any mistakes, this feels stretched.	O
I think it's a little like 2 tall.	O
Let me bring this monitor down for a second.	O
He also make sure the quality is still good.	O
If somebody's are very Kristen, so these aren't, you know so that makes me know that it's like not the entire ribbon.	O
It's like individual pieces of that.	O
I think we call is really cool and he started actually like think about hiring to do text in here.	O
We just make sure we're showing two.	O
Feels very cohesive but I understand you how we're trying to just learn how to build like a case study.	O
You know cool yeah, thanks for sharing.	O
Talk with type from last week with Claudia.	O
So honestly yeah this will talk to type exercise like one of my favourites.	O
I love to actually see how I come across these all the time on Pinterest about how people like interact with words to make new things.	O
I think is really strong here with free and how it's behind bars.	O
This is like not free, which is like sad.	O
Shadows behind that also looks good, so it helps if you little like more layered.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Tell me how I can.	O
Yeah, I'd even tried flipping the colours.	O
Maybe the word free is like in white.	O
That or actually maybe it's supposed to be black.	O
I don't know, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you try flipping the colours or try.	O
Yeah, maybe a texture is well on the white.	O
Could be really cool to actually show.	O
Maybe it's like metal.	O
But I think this is really cool, is very good.	O
Like this strong messages also.	O
It is nearly also, uh, let's check out your menu design too from Hawks kitchen from the DCS from the previous DC challenge.	O
Nice, so I think this typeface for the sandwich shop works and it looks good for that.	O
I think when he starts to use it on a lot of these things it gets very busy because when you have like all these items that are stacked right here for some reason when I look at it feels like the text is kind of like wobbling or it's like not starting to my place or I don't know.	O
It's just that script typeface doesn't line up as well as like some of these other ones do, and especially with stuff like this he wants to be very clear that something like looking really fast for like Oh it's like $0.75 for red onions or something.	O
You want to be like.	CHITCHAT
No, that that's there, you know.	CHITCHAT
So I would maybe suggest even using like a Boulder version to like this typeface, or like maybe like something like cool some of this for some of those titles and then maybe like a typeface that using for the sandwich shop use effort desserts and like your choice and like kind of like keywords like that.	O
They want to get their attention for.	O
Well, I think the Flowers are really cool.	O
Another day at these stripes and I think it's really great that he kind of like fade behind like this white cloud.	O
So that way they like it, makes the text like really clear.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Emacs awesome, see, this was from the day one of the last challenge is cloudy.	O
Yeah, I think the shadows look good and really helps it feel like layered.	O
I think what throws me off to set the texture all lines up and you can see like the green go from here to there so that just kind of like my brain makes me know it's like OK this isn't like really stacked so I wonder if there's a way to kind of like play with the textures on like each layer being kind of like different.	O
I think the colors look good.	O
Yeah, it's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Play over the originals.	O
Been kind of zoom in there for a second.	O
Sweet, so you probably working like the art board that we already had.	O
Just make sure it's kind of like scale to where it should be.	O
Let me actually minimize that for a second.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK, I see you kind of using that up here for each different thing and if you can say like Day One challenge is something like challenge one, which I yeah, I think if you do it you may not need it like as big maybe have this like a smaller element to preach divide but make sure that you kind of fill up the entire artboard and then it's also like lined up from these edges.	O
I think that's something like small town keeps with attention.	O
But they want something that looks really good now.	O
Even the recommend.	O
Yeah, pushing it further and trying to use like texture on it.	O
Setting whenever I see them with texture it really just brings it to the next level.	O

But then you also like this little shape right?	O
Actually my heads blocking it like right there.	O
I can't like right there.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, maybe just get rid of that.	O
Exciting, that's just like maybe like I like something like just forgot about like a hidden part.	O
The color is being broken down.	O
I think that works well.	CHITCHAT
We may not necessarily need the colors, but if you do I would make sure that they're all like aligned on top as well.	O
So if you just go into the align tools like in illustrator, there's abundant kind of click into just kind of does it for you which is the.	O
So yeah, just make sure these are lined up.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yes, this summer.	O
I think you did a great job with this word.	O
Martin were trying to like talk with text because usually like the red in the middle makes it feel like super hot like him like he did like it is summer and then the lighter edges too.	O
So it's like in the middle is like burnt, you know, but it's that kind of fading out.	O
Yeah I think that works really well in the blue background to it does remind me of like summer.	O
I can see that like a beach T shirt like down here in Florida.	O
And T shirt designs being you know, the next one cool.	O
see I have it right here.	O
Cool, so yet is it curly idea?	O
I think it is well, I would just make sure it's centered in a T shirt then also go in and maybe scale it down a little bit 'cause when you print on T-shirts there's only so far you can go then.	O
Also keep in mind when you use like the gradient like this, sometimes you're going to be limited in like what kind of printing processes you can do.	O
But I think it's really cool to have this as a T shirt.	O
I think that would even you people would like Taurus would buy this like it works.	O
The business card?	O
Yeah, just double check.	O
The spelling is an eye right there.	O
Also this ones in all caps.	O
This ones lower case so just make sure what you're doing is I consistently.	O
So cool, yeah, I think the shape you're using down here super fun out maybe say make like 2 like two or three more of those and then make him like 5060% transparent and kind of like flip open.	O
Use them in different spots on this business card and maybe show me what the other side will look like as well.	O
That sexy body scale little bit V qv T is like the main like logo out maybe yet how did it fit?	O
Like up in there so it's super clear and then think about how this text aligns with each other.	O
So think about the hierarchy of what is most important 'cause for me I would imagine it would be like your name and then you title and then maybe like how to reach you.	O
So maybe think about like the name should be big and like the job title below it.	O
Oh my green screen is kind of like if I go move certain places my green screen starts to Crackle Or.	O
Yeah, then also think about like your email address on here too.	O
You gotta make sure it's not overlapping the shape.	O
If they're both like the same like white.	O
If you make this maybe like you mess with the Opacity and make it kind of transparent then I think it would be OK to kind of overlap when you have it like this starts to get a little tough.	O
The business card too if you want to add like your hometown or of portfolio like website or a phone number or something too so that way they can actually like or social media like something else.	O
We can not only know how to reach you but also know how to like.	O
See some of your work as well.	O
So like they can know if they want to reach you.	O
That makes sense.	CHITCHAT
So cool?	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah.	CHITCHAT
Big thing though.	O
Just stains out your ideas.	O
Make sure they're all like lined up like perfectly aligned if you brought up Mike into illustrator and use the line tool it will just kind of do all that for you for the most part.	O
Yeah, but awesome things down Tina.	O
Minimize that.	O
Played with type records, jeans awesome.	O
Let me open the original.	O
Bring that over here.	O
Let me kind of just zooming out maybe.	O
We want to be working now.	O
Let me try it again.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so this challenge you know the goal was kind of.	O
Take a word and then kind of turn it into like trying to turn the world into like that word anyway so like talking with text talking with type.	O
This is one of those book called so pressure.	O
I think it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
I think they start to feel like two different words though so I may be like somehow have like one of these S is kind of like fade or feel like the essays are squished into each other.	O
So that way there's like pressure kind of built up with something with my hands, but that's how I cannot communicate like it.	O
Like squeezed, I think that's great where you have like the inside the text kind of bending in.	O
It's like literally squeezing it.	O
Maybe even have the tops of these like start to like swell out a little bit towards like exaggerating it.	O
Because when I sort of think of these I try to think about like OK how would this be animated in like how is this doing afterwards and one of the key like principles of animation is like exaggeration like kind of overdoing the movement to really show it.	O
Like relax, I think there's some.	O
It's like really exaggerated into.	O
I think the colours throw me off a little bit.	O
I start to think about a Google like logo for some reason just like oh.	O
It's just like the colours something but.	O
Yeah, the waviness of relax I think is a good idea, but I think it's maybe 2 intensive waves for me to feel relaxed and roll how it's rolled up.	O

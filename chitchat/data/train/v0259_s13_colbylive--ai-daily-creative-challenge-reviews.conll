I think that works well.	CHITCHAT
Would be cool if you had another word like over here like rolled up or like.	O
Ed or something that's like rolled.	O
Don't know?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think yeah, this is my space over here that can be played with.	O
Or maybe it's just repeating like roll on the inside and roll over here and you just sound like parts of the word.	O
Yeah, that's really quality.	CHITCHAT
Seem like talking text is like my favorite ones I think.	O
So Johnny Quest.	O
Next we're checking out some of this work.	O
Yesterday.	O
Here the cards with suggested changes cool.	O
So let's look at this cover 'cause I really like this mark that you're using.	O
Nice yet is very like he's like futuristic style, which I think is really cool and this color works well.	O
The contrast in the background.	O
I'm curious if the space over here is the same as the space over here.	O
I'll maybe make sure it's aligned.	O
I guess it's lined up with this.	O
So maybe that's where you want to look at it.	O
Yeah, I guess it is.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's just like me looking at it for plants.	O
Yeah, that's super cool marks.	CHITCHAT
Very interesting.	CHITCHAT
I'd be curious what this like you know represents maybe like doves, peace on Earth or a death star.	O
So our King Saul Designer paints on it and also URL.	O
Other ships are cool.	O
I think they may be like a little too intense that they don't feel like they were on purpose and maybe like feels like somethings like accidents happening so I may be trying to find a way to like put these shapes a little more.	O
Yeah, and I think the black text, I think it might be better for his white text too, so really contrast with the background and that way like this QR code.	O
Yeah, I think that way.	CHITCHAT
I think we really want this to be white 'cause I think the first thing you want to see is like your name.	O
So that's like we should draw attention to most.	O
But right now, like these colors are super bright compared to that.	O
It would be hands to a little trick I learned is instead of having to spell out all of the hands you can do b.net dash rat mini just so we can kind of short URL as well.	O
So challenge three also.	O
Let's check this out Purdue.	O
So let's look at some of the challenges or something submissions.	O
So fake it so fake it until.	O
Until you make it OK, take it until you make it OK.	O
So yeah, that was coming to figure out like like understand the quote, which is how is able to figure it out.	O
But just be think about 2 how people usually reach you see start which you have right like the top left which like fake and then you know maybe you go like left to right you kind of go away like down.	O
At least that's how we do it here in America.	O
And so yeah, when you're using like words more than once and it showing it through scale.	O
I got that because I know the quote but I think that would be really hard to communicate without that.	O
And like so, maybe you do need like a fake it until you make it like I think you might need this actually like words in there just to really like communicating clearly.	O
Nicole is really nice though.	O
Challenge for.	O
So let me open that one up to you because that was kind of small.	O
We bring it up here so SB designs quadrant typefaces work.	O
Yeah, like they aren't actually borders around there.	O
Maybe this is like the trim work, maybe that's part of the design.	O
I think that's good.	CHITCHAT
Sweet.	CHITCHAT
Going to challenge one.	O
The adventures.	O
So one thing I want to say to his double check your spelling so I know on here you also have challenge, spell wrong, adventurous and I know a lot of times you know English may not bills first languages and stuff, but just whenever we're going to design you want like just double check just sending a lot of times like when you're doing it in illustrator.	O
It's not going to automatically tell you it's spelled wrong, you know.	O
So I think this is really cool colors happening with the Brown in the green and instead had like this pool like like a swimming pool like type texture over top of it, which I think is really cool.	O
It throws me off.	O
Is the red and like the white dots in the background it feels very different than everything else.	O
Maybe it's like a picnic blanket or it's like a close up of like a strawberry or something but it does start to feel very different from these, especially since these have like that pool like that swimming pool type like texture on top of this.	O
And also another one so be shapeless and formless, like water.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So see if you're trying to show it's like water.	O
Maybe send you some Blues and maybe like help.	O
The quote kind of feel like it's like water as I like these rounded edges and it feels very organic or maybe even show it with like.	O
This texture using here which is like that pool filter maybe even just like.	O
Maybe just show like that on top of.	O
This just kind of like help get like another element to it and maybe think about two quotation marks.	O

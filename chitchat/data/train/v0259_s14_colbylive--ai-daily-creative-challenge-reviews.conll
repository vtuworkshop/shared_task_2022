If it is like a quote.	O
Maybe you could also bring like shapeless beside B and then an formless.	O
So it's like the shapeless and formless like water and it kind of fits more like a better like block.	O
Yeah, the Super cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
We give this and thumbs up when I got a second.	CHITCHAT
So Monday cool.	CHITCHAT
Let me open the original come on really zoom in like that mark route working with.	O
So this is from one of the challenges is this past week as well.	O
Let's bring that over cool.	O
So yeah, I think you did great, but the highlights all being like insist on the same edges and the colours.	O
I think that works well.	CHITCHAT
I would think about you, the direction that the offset like shadows going.	O
So if the highlight is hiding from this angle, it makes me think that the sun is somewhere like where the light is somewhere over here.	O
And so maybe the shadows should be on like this side of it.	O
And then out of think about you, what you're trying to communicate through like Monday, whether it's like Garfield and it's like Oh Mondays are terrible.	O
Or it's like it's Monday.	O
I'll just think about what you're trying to communicate through Monday, just so that way you can try to like put some that symbolism in through that Typography as well.	O
So let's scroll up, see which other ones we can find.	O
Cool, so this is by a Stella.	CHITCHAT
Is it also an active member as well?	O
So it's really cool?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think this design works well and you have all these lines are like pointing us towards that S and it looks like there's a little bit of orange behind that she was like still little addition.	O
Then yeah, you really started bringing that orangish yellow like behind there.	O
It, even as I may be right out your full name as well too, so they know like how do we dress you, whether it's like right?	O
Like Stella and maybe your last name or test.	CHITCHAT
Or yeah, I think it's always good to include your full name or like the title, the business or something rather than just the S.	O
So design is passion place.	O
Yes, I really liked the typeface you're using for this out.	O
Maybe think about maybe not capitalizing the eye for is.	O
I think maybe that would be lower case and that would also give it give you the ability to bring these like a little closer together.	O
So let me minimize some regional left side.	O
I think the colours like having this like lighter like muted yellow, the background, it works really well because this is such like a vibrant yellow.	O
Yeah, that is good.	CHITCHAT
I would think about you like we see right here.	O
How like this Mexican mouse.	O
Unlike the ion passion, how the black sheep goes a little bit to the left of it, but it doesn't do it on this one, so I'll just make sure that they are consistent in little things like that, and especially if you bring this one lower case.	O
Make sure like all of these have like consistent space like that around it.	O
Then awesome on the teacher.	O
So yeah, I think this may be a little low.	O
'cause yeah I think that would be like I think maybe like a little low on the T shirt.	O
Someone you want to hire and then this is cool down here too.	O
I think about like where that is where you want it.	O
I don't know if people put up with the colours or we built in front of the shirt.	O
They have a small here and thing on the back so I'll just think about like how it's going to look on a person and also maybe make sure that is like exactly centered as well.	O
Let's do this one so it from space mom nice.	O
So let's look at the backside for.	O
So yeah, the cover is just like these chips around here.	O
I'll put it in case I think looks great that K&S, like I love how it's like.	O
I'm gonna open up to 7 C.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Like I was like pointed right there, that feels like very fancy thing that works well.	O
And then I like how this is very like solid shape that you're using around that because that purple like Starship coverage retention in the KS is what like is the main thing communicates.	O
That's like dope.	O
Let me exit out that let's.	O
Check out the other side of that.	O
Let me bring it up a little bigger schools starflower photography also, so I think the letting which is like the space between those two words right here could be like brought down a little bit.	O
I think they'd be a little closer together.	O
I would also yeah, maybe play with this style of these.	O
Maybe these down here should be like a thinner typeface and then keep this one like a little bolder.	O
I do love that this is like latter.	O
It's darker and so it's a lot of high contrast between those backgrounds, which I think helps a lot.	O
Let me double check something over here.	CHITCHAT
It looks like my stream quality may not be that good right now.	CHITCHAT
Baby girl They were OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let me know the stream quality goes down.	CHITCHAT
It's just I think because it's my preview device.	CHITCHAT
Which is still not showing the chat right there for a moment.	CHITCHAT

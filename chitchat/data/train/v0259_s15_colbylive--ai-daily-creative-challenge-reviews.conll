Give me just a second to kind of fix that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think we're good black Becky saying, can you review my work?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, definitely, UM yeah, I think you're active.	CHITCHAT
Using discord.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can just search yours.	CHITCHAT
I I'm going to guess this is you because the same profile picture of the same name.	CHITCHAT
So let me know if there's a specific project or if I'm like you know, looking like older stuff or something.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's check this one out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, these two new by picking, that's awesome.	O
Let me actually check out what this was, so maybe you're asking a question about this one.	O
Let me check this out, it only this one.	O
Which I think is treehouse looks insane like this is really impressive.	O
Yeah, the edges of the trees look really good and you really doing great job with the lighting and showing depth this thing, no?	O
No, no that.	CHITCHAT
No that one.	CHITCHAT
Well, we do this.	CHITCHAT
How do your portfolio directions?	O
Yeah, let's do this one right here.	O
So that looks like when they will share challenges.	O
Yeah, sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kind of like going blindly from like the side over here.	O
But let me yeah, let me click away from now for a second.	O
Let me make sure this is all the way up.	O
And we can see in a little bit, so might as well can you review it on the beginner?	O
Yeah, totally let me.	CHITCHAT
Yeah we do surface phone.	O
Which it looks like you like.	O
This one is definitely do it again.	O
Follow you so day.	O
One cover art.	O
So super cool typeface using here.	O
It's very like blocky, which I always like.	O
This ones that are like super like big blocky.	O
It feels very like vintage or like I'm not vintage.	O
It feels very like come.	CHITCHAT
Ancient, you know?	O
So my challenge.	O
So when I see this like how like fuzzy and roughly edges are, it makes me think that it's like pixelated, not like rough and up.	O
So I would maybe bring that back a little bit, not do it like as intense.	O
Yeah, maybe even like.	O
See if you can play with a little bit of like shadow on it or something.	O
Just that I don't help him feel more like it's like grounded in there.	O
Or if there's something you can have like that texture kind of showed through, like on top of that text.	O
I think that would really help.	O
So did you talk with type, place?	O
These type of transform tools to modify words?	O
So yeah, double check like space, right in front illustration, meaning without using images.	O
Yeah, I'm really.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, yeah bubbles until you end up doing it from the other way.	O
We're talking about two, which I still don't know if that's the right way to do it like it makes sense to me.	O
Like you read from left to right, but then you do things like, oh, maybe it's descending, but it's like they're starting to ascend from this side.	O
So it was something that was is tough to figure out what the best answer is that 'cause I don't know, but I think that it looks really nice and I think the bubbles like the edges look really good.	O
How it's like a darker blue and it's getting really late in the middle.	O
Yeah, little bit.	CHITCHAT
Graffiti this looks great.	O
Yet here I did the.	O
I think this is the version two that has like the graffiti like letters like staggered where you had two that you're kind of deciding between.	O
But I think this looks great and all of its different colors.	O
It's very like playful and feels very like kid friendly.	O
And then look videos.	O
It's got the little line between that kind of like glasses and peoples eyelashes.	O
Yeah, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, maybe even say like maybe it's a different typeface to work better for this.	O
Museum with these ones of these points to like.	O
Yeah, I don't know.	O
Maybe different.	O
I think there's a lot of interfaces that can work for this, 'cause it's like a very like you know, like thought out idea is very clear what it is, so I would experiment with these other ones I could work.	O
Day three T-shirt slogan Designable Typographic T shirt slogan.	O
So I do like how you're breaking up all these sections and how it's like very clear what days what and how you actually describe it to for people who weren't a part of that saying you remember, well yeah no, definitely yeah lot of 'em do stand out to me so that's also.	O
But now it's called an especially cool seeing, often lined up here like together too, so I can see, like like I forget to someone's at the bubbles and the graffiti, or both you so it's cool to see all of 'em in like like Oh wow, you multiple good ideas come together so it's awesome.	O
Yeah, so yeah W doing for these titles.	O
Time is money and money is what we're here for cool.	O
So yeah, I like that this lighter like that.	O
I wonder like that black really stands out to me too.	O
I wonder if it worked well if it was like a lighter color too.	O
I think the is looks cool.	CHITCHAT
I like that it almost feels like someone took a Sharpie to the T shirt and was like I'm right like someone like Witten finish the quote, you know?	O

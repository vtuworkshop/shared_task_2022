I think this these are these are lower case.	O
These are all caps.	O
Maybe just do one or the other.	O
I kind of like that is lower case.	O
Maybe think about having this lower case or if it doesn't look good.	O
Maybe think about having this caps or maybe leave out.	O
Is that something I would just think about playing with?	O
And maybe I like that is just starting over at the Y.	O
Maybe you could also make it a little bigger like rotate it and you can feel like it's like placed on top of that.	O
Like these cars like this like lighter, grayish, brownish, greenish.	O
Whatever that color is mixed on top of this light green.	O
I think it looks really good.	O
The Black is that almost like 2 like much.	O
I think this is car design.	O
A business card using lines and symbols to create a striking optical effect!	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, throws me off their space here in here.	O
I'll maybe show.	O
This business card like left and right side and this one below here like separately.	O
Maybe just as I get right here and I'm like Oh is there image that hasn't loaded yet.	O
OK, so it's all one long ribbon too, which makes sense how it's laid out like that.	O
Yeah, the real estate house.	O
I love that there's all these lines leaving in there all kind of pointing towards the text and that you actually make a house out of like the negative space.	O
I think that's a very clever.	O
The real estate house you have.	O
It's about.	O
The second zoom in.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Uh, so I think that works.	CHITCHAT
I would just.	CHITCHAT
To real estate the house, I think that works.	O
I'm not crazy about the light kind of shining through the text of balance.	O
We need this text.	O
I would just make sure with this you have a little bit extra space on the sides.	O
It looks like the www.com you have a little space bound say give it a little more than that.	O
Maybe like double that and then do the same over here and make sure it's like consistent and then seeing the phone number.	O
Maybe think about adding parentheses or like little dashes between.	O
It's just that way like people when you see a lot of numbers together, it seems it's harder to just immediately type in the number, but if you break it up into intervals like 334 then it's like can be a lot easier if you will just see it and understand it quickly.	O
Meeting It's awesome so yeah.	O
And also yeah you business cards right here.	O
Look great.	CHITCHAT
I love the purple and green colors using here.	O
This make it a little too dark.	O
Especially start to run into people with like different visual impairments.	O
And like maybe he's trouble with like color vaccine color.	O
So I'll just make sure it's super clear.	O
I love how you're using that here and it used a little bit of a texture.	O
On top of that.	O
Yeah, I think is awesome graphic designer.	O
Any of your portfolio.	O
It's very clear like your name.	O
Yeah, I think that's right.	O
The second zoom out back to normal.	O
Yeah, that's also let me exit out that.	O
Let's see, there's one more you haven't hear about setting the full case study for his math one yet.	O
Let me type in a Monica or Monica.	O
And let me know two this is you 'cause different picture.	O
Yeah, Monica, let me know if this is your project as well, like videos, usually delayed by minute, so it may take a second.	O
Yeah, this from the last challenges, and if not, we're going to check it out anyways.	O
Get sweet so yeah and this one.	CHITCHAT
You actually have the same picture.	O
It looks like he's taking the 2nd to load.	O
Yeah, just give this a second.	CHITCHAT
Sweet.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it is from the last series.	O
Can you review my kitchen?	O
Yeah, definitely let me do that.	O
Yeah, I did after these steam and he had no problem.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah anytime.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So it looks like when you upload this to you maybe give it a little bit of padding on the edges, or it may not be big enough to fit in there.	O
I would just say since it is a long ribbon, maybe just trying to bring all the edges just so I can really see.	O
Like all this text, these those any small I won't be able to read it, but right there I can.	O
Well, I'm not posting this important.	O
Yeah no region?	O
Yeah no check out the kitchen wonder because the kitchen theme was Superfund anyways, do.	O
Design eye catching cover art for your Venus project using the layered paper effect, achieve a realistic look using the pen tool texturing Mass in the appearance panel.	O
Cool if they actually laid out the colors that used to make it as clear as possible.	O
It's like OK, this is the colour palette.	O
Then you start to actually use them for all these going forward, which is really cool.	O
Yes, I think you do good job with the shadows like the layers and the tax share.	O
It does feel very realistic and feels very layered.	O
Legacy must stream does not load.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if anyone else is having the same issues.	CHITCHAT
It could be a connection.	CHITCHAT
OK now I'm back cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, that was mixed with some like Oh no.	O
Maybe the video cut out or something but cool yeah so.	O

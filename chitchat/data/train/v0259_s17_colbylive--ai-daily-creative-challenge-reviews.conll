Yeah, I really liked the colours using here.	O
I would maybe think about the shapes like this shape feels with a sharp angle and then it goes these rounded ones.	O
It feels very like different.	O
You know 'cause these ones, how they're very like Triangle Circle, you know line.	O
It's like this main shapes, which is cool but this one it starts to feel like a some type of blob thing.	O
So maybe bring up different shapes or maybe think about maybe using shapes to actually like have some symbolism or something like a a challenge like.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Even just the circles are just like maybe just making clouds reshapes.	O
I think would be really cool too.	CHITCHAT
'cause it makes it start to feel like less like you just showing they can do shapes and more that you're showing like you're trying to communicate something through the cover.	O
Hey, I look on there too.	O
That still works and also.	CHITCHAT
As a man, I haven't been under the maiden.	O
You like illustrator logo, so you could also look for that one online too.	O
I don't know if it's easily accessible.	O
So they do so awesome.	CHITCHAT
So I would say to you, don't let the case study get in the way of the artwork because right now when, let's say we divide this in half, you know we're seeing like less than 1/2 of the full ribbon is actually the artwork is so really to see these nice details like 3 soap or something.	O
We have to zoom in there a lot.	O
So I would say let these images be big and maybe put the titles on top or like overlap the corners or something.	O
But like these images that are smaller on the side or the ones that like I really want to see you know.	O
See, I'm not looks great.	CHITCHAT
The colors are cool, I just think about you with colored symbolism.	O
You really want to use one colors for like melt.	O
It makes sense.	CHITCHAT
So when it's like blue or like this like light blue, dark blue is something like Oh maybe that's like freezing or something so it's like give me like the opposite 5.	O
I think love came out really great.	O
You could even try shifting over some of this a little bit, but I seen the owl is kind of like there to frame the edge of the heart is just this Easter skits squish little bit over here and you start to lose like that bottom like leg.	O
Yeah, I really want to get into those details.	O
You know something.	CHITCHAT
Just zoom in some more.	O
So we had tents right here.	O
If when I was zoomed out that far I had no idea there was a second T there, and so I think it's a clever idea.	O
But to make sure you're communicating as clear as possible 'cause when you have this big ribbon case study and have small details like that, that's when they really started last, especially when the images smaller but so.	O
Yeah, this works well.	CHITCHAT
I would maybe even think about like.	O
Hum, who's like Becky's project, how she did like the bubbles, how it's like, a light white and then maybe like blue around the edges.	O
I don't think about the colours are using too, so it's so maybe you something that like kind of looks a little like soapier like Airy.	O
Or yeah I thought Flowers in there too, but those elements do start to get lost whenever it's like showing very small.	O
I do love this textures you're putting inside this box.	O
I think that looks really good.	CHITCHAT
It's remind me to text your dad like Hank Washington uses when he makes like his fuzzy illustrations.	O
If you are familiar with them.	O
Sexy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, he's talking a lot.	CHITCHAT
So persuading not.	CHITCHAT
Persuading not possible.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
To be honest, like I'm looking for the message persuading not possible, so maybe there's like a comma in there.	O
Or maybe like I don't know.	O
It's just hard for me to like understand like the meaning behind it.	O
Maybe it's just going completely over my head or something.	O
Nothing when you work with text like this, maybe even find a way to bring this up a little bit so you can start to see how like.	O
This type of the T sticks up above this text a little bit, but it could be cool for that fit in like right there in that piece.	O
So it's like persuading.	O
It's like not like the T here and then like possible and maybe like these three letters fit in right before that G and so they start to feel like very like nested inside of each other for it feels like it's locked up together.	O
Yeah, this is hard this kid so it looks like it's a little pixelated.	O
So you're like gmail.com?	O
Yeah, I think about when you're showing like phone numbers actually break it up.	O
How you kind of see a phone number of looks like 334 like little hyphen or princis, just that super clear like what the number is.	O
And then gmail.com.	O
Maybe think about that's an email like including like a username at Gmail to see you to have like the approximate like length of like that text.	O
And then being project this.	O
So let me zoom out.	O
Bill rose 6 million.	O
Yeah, this one's whole PS project.	O
The last one was this case study so it's cool.	O
Yeah, I would really just scale this up like a lot and maybe like this image.	O
Like think about like having scaled to where it's like even close to the edge of the whole edge.	O
That's super cool.	CHITCHAT

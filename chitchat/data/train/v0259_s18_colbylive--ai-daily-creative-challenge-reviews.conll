Yeah, thank you for sharing.	CHITCHAT
And let me know if you have another project we check out to go check out jeans from Hawks kitchen.	O
Look Something, let me try this little search here and then we'll see the chat student participated.	O
Yeah, let me know if you have anything.	O
Let me check out.	CHITCHAT
Even if it's an older one to be happy too.	O
Let me try something else.	CHITCHAT
If somebody just keeps on moving down here.	O
Just second, I'm looking on the other monitor real quick.	O
Cool so Jane, I actually didn't find in discord, but it's probably like a little further back, so I clicked on your page and I found it's like, you know, the AI challenge vanderhoff rattle in there.	O
So let me know for sure if this is the one.	O
I do remember this one, which is really cool.	O
So yeah, I think.	CHITCHAT
If you did participate in this last one too, it could be really cool to show all this like in a case study, kind of like what we did on Friday is daily creative challenge.	O
We're going to feel like a whole ribbon of it all laid out 'cause I think this works to kind of see it, but it's almost like too many images at once that, like when I view it, I get kind of overwhelmed and Marcus.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no problem anytime.	CHITCHAT
But what works with this too is I can click on it kind of review them individually.	O
So I send you link please.	O
Yeah gene, if you have a link that you want to drop in the chat, if it's different than this, then Yeah, it looks you or if not this is the one that you're thinking about like so let me know.	O
Sound like zoom in like looking really close.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Right, so it is cool.	CHITCHAT
Um, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So I think it's really nice how James Kitchens in that type faces.	O
But then whenever you do like whole food recipes and like this down here, it starts to get a little tougher to read.	O
Maybe you better do like a more like body copy typefaces like the secondary one and then have like the James Kitchen in like that script typeface.	O
But I love this.	CHITCHAT
It's like a very vintage like.	O
That cookbook design that you see nothing is green.	O
The Civil War looks great too.	O
Local numbers look at you.	O
Yeah, this looks great.	CHITCHAT
What's up just some notification?	O
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
Hey Keith, yeah so I'm just looking over some of the AI daily crave challenges from this past week and from like recent ones.	CHITCHAT
And you have a project you want to share?	CHITCHAT
Want me to check out?	CHITCHAT
Just let me know I'm going to be doing for maybe like another 1520 minutes at most.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, if you have one that you want me to check out, drop the link in the chat or in the discord and I'll be happy to review it and give feedback.	CHITCHAT
Was going to see it.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, so the James Kitchen.	O
I think you wouldn't want to make this types face much larger than this, but then you have this space in here that feels kind of like awkward to me.	O
Yes, I wonder too if the text may be stronger.	O
Even just having like at the base down here.	O
Also is nicely addict little number so we can talk about like 0123 or 4 maybe make sure they're all kind of level or maybe like after the corner or something.	O
I do like the shading on this a lot.	O
I think it looks really good.	CHITCHAT
But this one is probably my favorite just because it's like the least amount of colors.	O
And if you work, I think it works best as like a logo in the long run.	O
You could definitely scale up PS like established 20 and Aidc.	O
I think you may be scaled up to fit this whole space and maybe use like a body copy one.	O
Look, I got tagged in something.	O
So we bring over here for a second.	O
Let me minimize that for a second cool, um.	O
Yeah, I think we've lost speech.	O
You probably scale is a little bit.	O
You also have like this stroke that surround the text, which I don't think you really need.	O
I think you probably just leave just the green Phil 'cause like with this one, how is just the black text.	O
I think those nicely.	CHITCHAT
But then when you have like the little stroke that gets around there like there's going to be, you won't be able to scale it down too much more without that stroke.	O
Kind of like disappearing.	O
So yeah, maybe just try to make it work without it.	O
Didn't mean you nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this pattern around is cool I think since there's so many of them, that's almost like hypnotising me or drop me in a little bit.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think would be cool if you had some of these and maybe you like reversed one and so we found a way to kind of like having a fit in together.	O
It's kind of like help make the pattern that wage war it's like even the same one may be scaled.	O
Maybe rotate different directions so they kind of fit inside.	O
It's like message each other if that makes sense.	O
And didn't even maybe put the Opacity and have it like salty rich where it's like, not just like why don't black.	O
Maybe it's like come now mid grey, like different Gray or something or it's like more subtle.	O

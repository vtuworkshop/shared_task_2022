Let's see I think this title of here looks great.	O
I think many of James kitchen here.	O
You maybe don't need it again right here and then I think we are using this design a little too much.	O
If there's a way to do like.	O
Baby push like this do like a pattern or something and then use that.	O
I think it would help a lot to bring like other elements into it.	O
Uhm yeah.	CHITCHAT
When I said to look at the actual text, it breaks down.	O
I think this is good.	CHITCHAT
However, like lined up, I like that the starters shares pasta, pizza.	O
Those are all like larger so I can bounce around on.	O
Keep building by Behance page.	O
I'm reading a personal logo age uplink in there.	O
Don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'll check that out after this.	O
Windows Phone Jane.	O
Nickelodeon.	CHITCHAT
I love how using the white on that lighter color, it's going to be hard for to come out like even printed, but it's a very nice like subtle element, so if you could do create like a pattern or something, maybe have that be like this white on this very light color so it's like something that's like hard to see until it's like physically right there.	O
Something else, choose the prices so it kind of bounces around between different sides out.	O
Maybe think about having left side or almost like the right aligned or something, but making sure it's very clear, like where these prices are, or if it's a right next to the titles.	O
So I'll just make sure it's not consistent.	O
He weighed thanks for tuning in.	CHITCHAT
Nice to see you.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you joined in the chat.	CHITCHAT
You're right now.	CHITCHAT
You don't know.	CHITCHAT
Moderate are shield though you know.	O
Hum venoms reducing the illustrator daily creative challenges.	O
Glad you're here.	CHITCHAT
So James Kitchen awesome.	O
So I think this is great.	CHITCHAT
This text.	O
I think it may be scaled up little bit.	O
You probably in this corner.	O
Maybe like a little bigger so that way, like really contrast with everything else.	O
I love how the bread came out really nice.	O
I'm just gradient.	O
The colors work feel grounded.	O
Killing spree, I would just say with the civil war here.	O
Um, maybe play with like blurring the inside of it.	O
Or like an opacity or something and maybe make a white and make it like a 20% opacity or something towards like it.	O
Feels like you're looking through like class or something else so you have to catch one.	O
Yeah awesome and this is one of my normal streams are like anyways too but.	O
Yeah, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Glad to hear.	CHITCHAT
Nice, you know.	CHITCHAT
So whatever we do it like Hawks kitchen as well.	O
And we started with like Steaks like branding like letters onto him.	O
Yeah, the substrate, so something with the civil war out.	O
Maybe think about having like that filled in somehow, like playing with you can blur that or make it like very like transparent.	O
Yeah, but I think this will greatly eggs like around that.	O
All of that and like the edge of the mushrooms came out really nice.	O
This feels like it may be a little too bright kissing.	O
I fell.	O
I know some of you by now with the I feel like I know some of you by now with the Adobe hands activities.	O
No, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
None like same way too.	O
Like how no waves with other people and waiting.	O
I know I'm shield this, I know right?	O
I could upgrade you but you know who knows what you end up doing.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think it's cool.	CHITCHAT
I think it could be nice to try to bring like a texture.	O
On top of that, like burger.	O
It would be really cool to show that.	O
And then also I like that it's transparent.	O
Maybe even bring that down just a little bit.	O
And now it says James Kitchen.	O
I think that could also be.	O
Less dark riders.	O
Maybe just bring the opacity down by 50%.	O
And yeah, I love that you'd like to checkerboard like picnic table like background.	O
But then you have like these lines that I don't think are less like 100% necessary, especially when you look at the thickness between that one.	O
And then you look at between there.	O
There are a little off so I would just play with them.	O
Yeah, just how that lines up is something we're gonna have.	O
So nice, yes.	CHITCHAT
So you start playing like filling in some of these two.	O
So even like these colors, how you doing?	O
It's maybe like bring down the opacity little bit.	O
Bye love you have the colors inside here.	O
This is great.	CHITCHAT
He was like definitely soup and then you have the logo over here.	O
Using is like a corner element so this is a different version of it too.	O
'cause you don't have that like half circle shape around it.	O
Which I think this works.	O
It's just again this space right here between the words really stand out to me a lot.	O
The positive and I see these are filled in.	O
I think that helps a lot.	CHITCHAT
In this so this looks really good as like a decorative element on the plate, so I would even recommend.	O
Yeah, maybe making that like a lot softer and having a continue 'cause I know there's a lot of like very fancy plates and stuff.	O
I do like Flowers, another like decorative elements on them.	O
So I think that could be really cool.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, the parcel of straight.	O
I think the cheese.	O
Maybe we played with little bit more summerlike strings.	O
Whether this was like a glob you know, so feel different and like I say I want your soup right, looks good.	O
Cool yeah I remember this one as well.	O
I think before you had wine glasses that were at different angle.	O
Keeps saying my typing skills are peckish can lead to typos, no worries.	O
And that's something that like happens to me all the time too.	O
And what helps me a lot is just having someone else who hasn't been looking at it.	O

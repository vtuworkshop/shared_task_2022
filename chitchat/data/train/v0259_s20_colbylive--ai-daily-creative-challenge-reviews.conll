Just look at it real quick 'cause usually like a fresh pair of eyes can like go along ways.	CHITCHAT
See, you show multiple things on here which is cool you're showing like the pie like the chart, but it's also like with the edge of the crust, which came out really nice.	O
You get this little shadow that's going on that works really well.	O
These ones are like 3D which is dope.	O
And this cake?	O
Yeah, there's a lot of cool elements going on here.	CHITCHAT
I think what throws me off, she was like the angle, little bit 'cause I'm looking at it like OK, this one's top down.	O
While some of these are like 3D and then some of these are top down and these are looking on the ledge I would just say whatever you're trying to show.	O
Make sure it's all may be showing out like the exact same like angle or separate images.	O
But I think you did a great job, but like this cake and like a lot of these different like objects inside of here.	O
Ooh yeah nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, he really just push it and trying out like a lot of recipes.	O
Yeah, this is great.	CHITCHAT
I like that you're doing different pie chart pie from Wendy.	O
I know, right?	CHITCHAT
That was one of the challenges we did too, so it's like.	O
Make an infographic and we kind of making it into like a physical pie as well.	O
It reminds me of like there's episode of How I Met Your Mother, where it's like it's like a bar chart of my favorite pies and like a pie chart of my favorite bars.	O
And it's like that you like graphics.	O
Yeah these are great.	CHITCHAT
Like you really took like this, we learned you really are starting off lights like other foods which is like came out really nice.	O
Like these that looks great.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think this line on top of their really stands up to me, but I'm not exactly sure what it is, so I can't really critique it.	O
Looks maybe that's how it looks.	O
Why is there no dedicated channel for in design?	O
Is the deli is asking?	O
I have no clue.	O
I guess there's only certain amount of channels you can have dedicated to something or it's just like if people are interested in that right in the discord channels and be like yo we want in design will do it like we want it.	O
'cause it didn't.	O
Do you have enough?	CHITCHAT
People were like saying they're interesting.	CHITCHAT
They will definitely consider it is I agree, in design is like incredible.	O
I mean awesome.	CHITCHAT
My other videos are based on like the stuff I was doing in in design.	O
So if you want like some.	O
Key stuff this help me set up.	O
Check those out.	CHITCHAT
There's also answer Hawk rattle.	O
I know he was going really deep into in design and there's some stuff you can really learn from him about using like tables and like Excel documents and like some crazy next level in design stuff.	O
Who is cool?	CHITCHAT
So for this challenge they had to go and make like a there's like a seating chart and kind of make the floor plan of like oh here's like the Hostess or host running through that with like their custom brush.	O
Yeah, it's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Nice yeah, thanks for sharing.	CHITCHAT
I think it came out really good.	CHITCHAT
I was just here trying to build a case study and show it all is like a long ribbon maybe.	O
So let me bring some stuff up over here.	O
Make sure I'm in the right channel before I switch back over.	O
Yep, getting very close to wrapping up too.	O
So if there's anything else you guys want to go over, let me know.	O
I think there's one in the chat amount of missed waiting.	O
Yeah, that was great sessions.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it definitely was.	CHITCHAT
Yeah Andrew Harleys.	O
Awesome super fun.	CHITCHAT
So let me go and check over here.	CHITCHAT
I think there is a link I missed.	O
From Keith And I think this is probably my last one today too.	O
And so if you want to see more of these, let me know if you want to see more me designer working like in design, different program, let me know 'cause I'm open to whatever.	O
Put it, minimize that.	O
Let me just bring over kids.	O
Project he shared as well.	O
Sweet, something minimize this.	O
There goes.	CHITCHAT
So the keep doesn't design, so I know you mentioned your reworking right here on like personal branding, so it's cool if it was.	O
Any feedback in chat, you know.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I love that you're using like it's not like a black color, but it's like an awful dark grayish color.	O
I think it's a really great.	CHITCHAT
I think that works.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it works well.	CHITCHAT
It's not like reading something inside.	O
Cool, did you get a little description about yourself as well?	O
It works well.	CHITCHAT
See you shouldn't like how it's mapped out and how you use like internal pieces of the logo for like measurements.	O
I think that's that works well.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you need to specify word marking letter Mark.	O
I think even just showing like one of these would work or something.	O
Hum, so yeah, I would think about you, the grid layout.	O
So keep saying I have started a project called what the fonts fonts based on puns.	O
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, with this to out, think about like maybe setting up like a grid system of like breaking this one graphic up into thirds and saying OK just left side third is going to be like the colors in like color codes.	O
The middle third is going to be like these and like the right third will be like these darker ones.	O
And then maybe just like I think having those like lined up for you will help it look more consistent when you view it all because right here how bounce between these.	O

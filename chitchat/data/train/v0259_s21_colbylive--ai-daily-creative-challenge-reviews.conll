They feel very like.	CHITCHAT
I know this feels very disconnected from the other stuff to me.	O
I love that you're giving this, like all this detail, but yeah, I think there could be a way to do that.	O
Or maybe you show all the logos and colors like left and right like stacked right here and then you go into the logo variations below it.	O
So you would think maybe other divided up into thirds and doing it.	O
That way you can do like this or maybe like separating them like different levels.	O
Enough.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, let's take some mockups.	O
You so I love that you are using one of these.	O
I really show a lot of well rounded sides of the brand and how you actually have like a label on here.	O
You have like the letter head.	O
This may be a little larger.	O
The letter head with scale it down a little bit.	O
And, Uh, Yeah, I think this looks good under the folder.	O
The pin.	O
So think about the text that's on this.	O
I know it's small right here, but it's going right next to the edges.	O
Just saw an error.	O
Yeah, I don't see yet though, so maybe I'll see it.	O
Yeah, all those edges.	O
Yeah I would try to bring those in a little bit.	O
I think it's cool you showing the app you know CD.	O
Yeah, all these I would say to it looks like you're showing the same logo and like.	O
Similar ways and maybe think about like OK, is there like a type of like very subtle pattern I can add like on this folder deck and also had the business card like maybe there's like.	O
Like some other way to really bring it to the next level, you know, like something else you can add to the brand.	O
Just have really help you feel more than just like text colors in a logo, but also like you bring in additional elements and symbols somehow to really just push even further.	O
So type these.	O
I like that you're showing these.	O
I think all three of these can be brought like side by side, so it's like 123 and then stick with the same grid system that you'd use up here.	O
So that way it's like OK, one column to column, three column.	O
You're doing the same thing here within text, so that way like it fuels like flows a little better that way.	O
Local variations, incorrect ways of doing it.	O
Cool, fair, something with like maybe lining up at like 3 columns and kind of like shut him lined up that way.	O
Yeah, great work.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate you Sean does that too.	CHITCHAT
It just be conscious, I think.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, maybe this area insult you if it is like this box goes above that.	O
Maybe that's a little closer to that.	O
Yeah, I think that would get like separated a little bit.	O
Yes, super cool though.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for sharing and I'm going offline guys but.	O
If you if you are interested in participating in the next challenge, is actually let me go and bring up that link really fast.	O

Sorry little cough now just talking too much.	O
I know in the past you know like where people are asking about in design too, so that's something you're interested in.	CHITCHAT
Reach out this week.	CHITCHAT
Is there off weeks 4th of July weekend, but in the future if you go to behands.net dot challenge that's illustrator will bring it in this page and you say hey take the challenge and sign up.	CHITCHAT

But if you're interested in like doing some of the projects we did this past week and going back.	CHITCHAT
How to reach out to in design?	CHITCHAT
I mean yeah, let me show that in just like it so you don't like the challenges so he's taken.	CHITCHAT
See Wendy's cover are talking type and there's like started files and yeah and by the end of it you can build like a whole case study.	CHITCHAT

I want to do a background with this, but I don't even know.	O
Is.	CHITCHAT

My issue would be I probably like the character would be better looking than any background I could make, and I don't want it to.	O
One I'm just not going to background.	O
I'm a people person.	O
But I also.	O
Would want it to be up to the part of the quality of the character, and I don't think that's going to happen.	O

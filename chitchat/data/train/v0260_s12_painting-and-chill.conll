Hum, OK, well if I go in steam right now.	CHITCHAT
I think you're lying me think I think you're.	CHITCHAT
That promise is alive.	CHITCHAT
Can you, at least if you're gonna play video games, can you please help me out really quick?	CHITCHAT
What do you think for uh?	O
For this design now 'cause?	O
So like against the original design has like this kind of zig zag.	O
Looking thing right with the.	O
Like mix of metals and stuff, but I just kind of like now that I'm looking back at it.	O
I just feel like it's kind of a necessary like.	O
I think if I was to make this armor like IRL and I was like the blacksmith to make this, I'd be so upset but there.	O
Two different kinds of metals on the legs for no reason.	O
You know I just.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I I don't know.	CHITCHAT
OK, you know.	CHITCHAT
For it to get rid of it.	CHITCHAT
I don't want it anymore.	CHITCHAT
Let me be a smart person today an actually uses.	O
Freaking tool to help me 'cause I feel like I just like I just draw stuff in the bad habit of mine like I'm aware of the lasso tool an the Polygon tool.	O
But whenever I I'm painting I just completely forget about him.	O
Genuinely I I'm so bad with it.	O
It's it's honestly shocking how I've.	O
Lived my life so long.	O
Making art and I still do this.	O
That's pretty wild.	CHITCHAT
Had people comment.	CHITCHAT
He would your workflow would be so much faster.	O
We just did this and said, Yeah.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
So then it's like kind of like an angle here, kind of sort of something or other.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I can't believe that the base color, but I chose and this is how beautiful string out.	O
Everything is purple.	O
I think I was.	CHITCHAT
Steam must be broken.	CHITCHAT
You know what I'm saying?	CHITCHAT
I like the change to the like I.	O
Like I think the back of the leg.	O
Was.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry what.	CHITCHAT
Like I think if the back of the leg was one and the front was a different one.	O
Are you saying like having like an asymmetrical design?	O
Man, that was hard for me to read.	CHITCHAT
I like genuinely could not repair.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Try and Draw Something 'cause I can't see.	O
Well me, I'm waiting.	CHITCHAT
This design rests in your hands.	CHITCHAT
You better hurry up, boy.	CHITCHAT
I think you're still playing video games.	CHITCHAT
Steam steam doesn't like.	CHITCHAT
You are a liar.	CHITCHAT
Line.	CHITCHAT
Everything was done.	O
But the Barrachina incident all over again.	O

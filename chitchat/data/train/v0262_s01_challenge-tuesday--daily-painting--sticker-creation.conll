OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
Doing good doing good.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Alright, alright so but I'm actually going to do is last minute change.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to do a little warm up sketch with an idea that I've been wanting to do and I keep on forgetting about it and that is changing my B RV screen to A.	O
To something that has like artists tips on it.	O
Like you know, stand up, take your breaks, stretch, hydrate that type of thing I want to.	CHITCHAT
I want to be useful.	CHITCHAT
Hey clever, how are you?	CHITCHAT
And got my T as well today.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to start with that.	O
Let's see how that's gonna go.	CHITCHAT
So I kind of want to have this is just going to be a big spoon hold on a second.	O
what I do need to do is right here.	O
I need to change this right here.	O
So we have our good 69.	O
Ratio here and zoom out a little bit so I can.	O
Get the whole picture here.	O
All glad you're doing good.	CHITCHAT
I am doing a little bit of a hodgepodge today.	CHITCHAT
An next they've actually started something really fun.	CHITCHAT
It was just announced yesterday.	CHITCHAT
Uh, be hands weekly challenge.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to incorporate that into my comic for Thursday, and the challenge this week is Corentine Awards, so I'm going to have that kind of decided my comic for me and I was like thank you, so I'm going to be.	O
The drawing my characters receiving their respective Corentin Awards.	O
So like happy paper will be most elusive.	CHITCHAT
An momo cheat will be best Baker or best cookies or something you know along the lines of baking.	O
Pudge will be something to do with books, writing, journaling, uhm, and so on and so forth.	O
Uh, maybe Jelly bunnies most mischievous than most full fee or something for the flu.	O
So I've gotta outline.	O
How I want to do that?	CHITCHAT
Because the last time I did like a badge ceremony, I had a scene of the character getting the badge and then I had a close up of the batch so.	O
Love you latest stories.	CHITCHAT
Lady pooping.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
That was a challenge for me because that I call it a talkie because it really it is a talkie to me.	O
I mean, I don't normally do speech bubbles an characters actually conversing and for some reason I wanted to challenge myself to do that and I really felt like these two characters would be talking to them that talking to each other a lot and.	O
I keep on going back to Calvin and Hobbes, but I think it it's a lot like that.	O
Like their, you know, walking together and join, you know nature and life together and I'm just talking about, you know the things that they've lived through so.	O
I thought an intro to them sticking together.	O
It would be pretty neat.	CHITCHAT
Lady Boop has been around.	CHITCHAT
I did her first comic last year and but she always kind of stuck with me.	CHITCHAT
Always liked her and I didn't really.	CHITCHAT
I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't really sure where to go with her and then I did the most recent one with her.	O
You know giving some encouragement to coconut and then when I drew Granny bear last week, it kind of just crystallize it.	O
But what I wanted them to do 'cause that seems like a really, really good pair.	O
So that'll be a lot in the future, and I've got to do writing on a lot of those because I mean that was a stumbling point for me.	O
Yesterday was actually getting the text and writing it, and you know, in.	O
I haven't written dialogue in a long time I mean I used to write daily and.	O
It's just.	CHITCHAT
He came a lot more easily.	CHITCHAT
One of his writing everyday.	CHITCHAT
Imagine that so.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let me start out with the I kinda want artist.	CHITCHAT
Not just artists but yeah.	CHITCHAT

Alright, so originally come.	CHITCHAT
I did a last minute.	CHITCHAT
I want to Draw Something other than what is on the schedule, so um.	O
Pardon me for.	CHITCHAT
So this is just a quick and this will probably be turned into a comic.	O
This is a quick just reminder to come.	O
If you're doing a lot of digital work, did oliart.	O
It can be kind of difficult to remember to get up, stretch and take your break.	CHITCHAT
So I'm doing my characters here, stretching, hydrating and taking regular brakes, so this one will be the two cats doing their little stretches.	O
The classic cat stretch and then mom was going to do more of a regular arm back, stretch and Hydrate.	CHITCHAT
You know, get your water, get your T and.	CHITCHAT
Then you know, timeliness.	CHITCHAT
Take those regular brakes and.	CHITCHAT
I am no several artists that use their phone.	CHITCHAT
They have timing apps that you know it's set for alarms like every hour, every hour and a half that there it's going off and reminding them to take breaks.	CHITCHAT
So that is what I am sketching as my warm up, but for the real deal I've got this guy which is going to be my daily unless I make that my daily.	O
This is my characters cleaning up a bookshelf and then they get distracted by the books.	O
So I've got this one.	O
Reading this one.	CHITCHAT
I haven't drawn in your arms or her book and then I have a lot of stacks and stuff to still draw in here and then.	O
The next thing on the docket, which is a blank slate.	O
This one is not like as much.	O
I'm going to be doing another 16 emote challenge for I'm going to be covering all of my characters.	O
But right now I'm covering tuxi Jones and I'm going to do stuff for Coco animal cheats, so those are the next Big Three that I'm working on.	O
Oh, you're welcome Santana.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you were inspired.	CHITCHAT
That's so wonderful.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Now let's go in here and.	O
I am going to get back in my group.	O
Yeah, let's do.	CHITCHAT
So she's doing the classic stretch over this way so.	O
You need to kind of.	CHITCHAT
Give her body weight.	O
I like that line, but I don't like that line.	O
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to select it and Drop it down because I want to keep it, but I want to make it smoother so.	O
That's a little better.	O
She's got more booty in this one though, but that's OK because she's kind of stretching and she's.	O
She's kind of come getting a lot of pops just doing that, so I want to plant her foot in front of her.	O
Pretty solid.	CHITCHAT
Oh I didn't mean for that too.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So for other foot is behind her and kind of.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
That's not quite what I want, so I kind of want it like.	CHITCHAT
She is.	CHITCHAT
She's got her to was kind of curling, pressed down like that.	O
I'm glad you like it, Indira.	CHITCHAT
I'll be I'll be going over uhm.	CHITCHAT
To this pretty soon my my warmups.	CHITCHAT
Usually they don't take me too long I don't imagine like this will take you too long so I'll be over on that one is shortly.	CHITCHAT
Uh, what am I doing?	CHITCHAT
I'm on the wrong one.	CHITCHAT
There you go with that over here.	CHITCHAT
And so let's position her arms so this arm is going to be behind her, so she's gonna be kind of stretch it up like that.	O
And then this one is going to be like.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's like that.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe her stretch is like this that makes more sense because you kind of go like that.	O
And she's got a smile on her face because it feels so good to stretch.	O

So let's see I kinda like head shape.	O
I think this is me which is destination.	CHITCHAT
Actually.	CHITCHAT
I can push her paws out more like that.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Take that.	CHITCHAT
Drop it down and use it as my guide line here.	O
Kind of think her little booty is a little bit too much.	O
Kinda wanna see.	CHITCHAT
And her other foot's going to be blocked over here.	O
I think for now that can be what I do.	O
There might straighten that up a little bit.	O
Give her her shoulder bits right there.	O
This one needs to be a little thinner and longer.	O
I think a kind of want.	CHITCHAT
Shopping.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Well, I've drawn them so much I, uh.	O
Remember, you know.	CHITCHAT
And also I do myself a favor and I keep their details pretty simple.	O
For example, the real coconut she has, she does have these shoulder patches, but one is one color and one of the other color baton.	O
As far as her character goes.	O
I kept in the same color so I wouldn't have to say, OK, no, I gotta remember as the Orange Patch on the right.	O
Or is it on the left?	CHITCHAT
In what direction?	CHITCHAT
That's just a little extra layer of.	O
Over thinking for something that really doesn't.	O
I don't think it really adds much is she has one Patch versus the same Patch so.	O
I just keep them simple.	O
And you know it's something too 'cause I.	CHITCHAT
And doing these.	O
As comics.	O
And drawing the same character over and over and over again.	O
So you want to make it easy on yourself.	O
And yes, you want to make any characters, but.	O
You don't want us.	CHITCHAT
You know, set yourself up for a lot of torture.	O
And it can be very easy to do that if you don't have.	O
If you're not really kind of.	O
Thinking ahead.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And also I use reference when I need to like if I don't know if it's an object in an environment that I'm not sure about, I will most definitely go for reference.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
She needs to be down lower.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Let's just select her head.	O

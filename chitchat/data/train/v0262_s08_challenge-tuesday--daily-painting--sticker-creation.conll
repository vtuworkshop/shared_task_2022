So let's step out into the group, right?	O
So her tail actually has a little story behind it.	O
It's a heart on the end.	O
Of it, as opposed to the I know, it's really close to like the Devil tail.	O
But when she was a kitten, she she had a really, really long, thin, almost like a rat tail.	O
So that's where the design of her tail came from.	O
and I actually carried that over to evil landlord.	CHITCHAT
But hers has just become so difficult to draw that way.	O
I switched it to just kind of more chunky tail with a dollar sign on it, and this is the actually the way that both of their tails are on the flush.	O
Moment she has a little stub of a tail but with a heart on it and I think eventually I'll probably probably switch into that, but I just.	O
I could never bring myself to make that switch for because this is, you know, that's her look that she's been for so long.	O
Another issue with the Plushy was that if she had a long, stringy rat tail that's not very child safe.	O
So I wanted the plushies to be child safe.	O
And so I had to make those changes.	O
Uhm, so no one, would you know, get hurt with the plushy, the first iteration.	CHITCHAT
It actually had the long string for a tail, and as soon as I saw that I was like.	O
No, that probably isn't gonna go.	CHITCHAT
That's probably not going to fly.	CHITCHAT
So that's a little bit about her tail.	CHITCHAT
She grew up to be a very beautiful cat and she lost some of the long thin rat to her tail.	CHITCHAT
Um, she's such a good girl.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I've got this stretching pose here.	O
And since coconut is in that position, will probably see some of her.	CHITCHAT
She's got like orange around her tail as well.	O
And Alright, so we get out of that.	O
And let's move over here to the Hydrate.	O
Actually, it's coming here and I'm like with these two separate.	O
Please I want to do something with him around a little bit.	O
All right, now we're on hydrate.	CHITCHAT
So I have no melati ankoko with come.	CHITCHAT
A Sippy Cup.	CHITCHAT
Now let's go ahead and start their classic.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
That's.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
That's OK, I'm not 100%.	CHITCHAT
Don't really want them to be insane.	CHITCHAT
It's coming here.	CHITCHAT

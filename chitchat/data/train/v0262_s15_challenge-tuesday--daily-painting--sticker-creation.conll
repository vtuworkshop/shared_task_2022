I think you probably could, but it would be a lot of work, like, uhm.	O
You could take the brush file an get the image at the brushes based off of.	O
In some cases bring it into illustrator, vectorize it, and then make a brush out of that but.	O
I think that I'm not.	O
As far as I have experimented in looked the.	O
The things that you can do for settings on the art brush and the regular brushes are a little bit different, so I don't know if you necessarily get the exact same thing, but you could probably bring in the base and use it.	O
I have several.	O
Ooh, save if you haven't lately.	O
I use when I do use texture brushes.	O
I am.	CHITCHAT
I have a couple sets from retro supply company that are really cool.	O
And those are so good, woman.	O
Alright, so I've got drag strip dry goods, Gray venturing quash vector fuzz vector hero vector sketch.	O
This is the one that has like tones and stuff, but those are more like cult fills up.	O
Let me see I like the grey venture set.	O
Those are a lot of fun.	CHITCHAT
Um, so let me just load some of these as an example.	O
Uhm, let me show you what you got here.	O
So there are options.	O
I don't think the options are nearly as long.	O
A list as they are for photo shop, but you know these can create some really dumb.	O
A really cool effects that he use him right?	O
But as far as I know, those can't be brought over well without a lot of headache and work.	O
But these guys have done a lot of good things and he had dry goods.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, this is just a certain.	CHITCHAT
And you don't get this.	CHITCHAT
It's just different because like when you're using, like if you're doing for example like a watercolor uhm, the brush that you have in illustrator is going to be like several different layers of transparency shapes that are built up an you don't stop the same thing in Photoshop.	O
But yeah, vector brushes work.	O
Oh yeah, I did dumb do a little bit late, but I was able to get my comic done.	O
So that's.	CHITCHAT
That is the important thing, but yeah, these guys are fun.	O
This is retro supply company.	O
If you're interested in a lot of vector support graphics, you know in effect type things.	O
They're really, really neat company that I've.	CHITCHAT
Hum gotten several things from every so often.	CHITCHAT
They do an everything box and.	CHITCHAT
It's all of their Photoshop and illustrator, brushes, textures, logotypes, everything in one.	O
I think they do it a couple times a year.	CHITCHAT
They do a discount on it.	CHITCHAT
I know it's a permanent thing in their shop.	CHITCHAT
Full price, but I think they they discounted steep.	CHITCHAT
I think around Christmas or something but they have a lot of good stuff for photo shop to.	CHITCHAT
They also have a lot of tutorials that they're putting out now for different kind of styles and effects that you can do in illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Do the ink ones.	CHITCHAT
I have to look into those.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT

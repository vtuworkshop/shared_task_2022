And just keep that level of consistency there.	O
Like that corner this.	O
Yeah, maybe.	CHITCHAT
And some of these I'd be able to have a little something in there.	O
Because, uh.	CHITCHAT
There's enough room, but other things you know.	O
Can't.	O
How did I get him off now?	CHITCHAT
Well, go ahead and get him something.	CHITCHAT
Give him a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I feel like if I go in here.	CHITCHAT
I feel like if I know well, actually hey.	CHITCHAT
I just got to be careful.	O
Although it kind of makes it, I don't know if it makes it harder.	O
To be here.	O
Let's try it on this end.	O
OK, and then I can come in here and maybe do.	O
I'm just playing.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I want to do here, so maybe a woman.	O
Do you sound just like cute little whining?	CHITCHAT
Memory should always keep it consistent, so don't you know, get your angles all over the place like I did with this E looks weird.	O
See how these are all more or less in the same.	O
Same direction.	O
Kinda hard when you also have the letters curving.	O
An angle themselves.	O
And it helps to step back at that point.	O
Tim Kaine welcome.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing today?	CHITCHAT
I thought you write a sketch.	CHITCHAT
This sum was supposed to be a warm up in an idea that.	O
Was not supposed to last this long, but.	O
As with many things that got into it and got carried away so.	O
That's OK.	CHITCHAT
I will get to the other stuff.	CHITCHAT
This isn't too shabby, I think I, I think I like this.	CHITCHAT
I'll do a little tweaking.	O
Up here and there.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Here we go, a little bit of something, something there.	O
So it's not just straight.	O
Straight up text it looks a little bit different than what I've got here.	O
My last little thing, so I don't mess up when I come in here and expand the text.	O
And then I'm going to group this big Ole Miss.	O
The sad and delete that.	O
Welcome Daniel.	CHITCHAT
Welcome a man.	CHITCHAT
How are you guys doing today?	CHITCHAT
Alright so this uhm?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to switch gears and go over to Speaking of taking regular breaks.	O

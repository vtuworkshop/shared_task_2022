I'm going to take a quick break to stretch and walk a little bit and I am going to zoom in here so you guys can see.	O
I'll cover this up and post.	O
It probably is a comic.	O
Maybe it'll be my third this week.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but I'll be switching over to this illustration now, and I'm going to fill in the rest of the detail here and then hopefully start on some coloring your next hour and a half, but let me zoom in here and show you guys what's going on.	O
I've got.	CHITCHAT
My characters were trying to clean a bookshelf, but then they.	O
You gotta open every book that you're considering getting rid of, and they got a little bit involved in the books that they're trying to clean out.	O
So I'm going to have.	CHITCHAT
I didn't get her book drawn in, but I'm going to draw that one in, and then I need to fill up the shelves a little bit more.	O
I've got her feather duster here and I've got some fruits that are kind of playing around.	O
On the shelf, I've got my perspective lines back.	O
Here is a guide and I have some different things in this scene.	O
I've got some hanging plants up here I've got.	O
I think that was supposed to be another hanging plant, but I might mix that because I mean that's too hanging plants.	O
I may do like a.	CHITCHAT
Like the edge of A.	O
A picture frame or something up here.	O
Just 'cause I gotta fill in this area and if I zoom out.	O
I'm going to also drop in like some foreground books that are big and maybe a few folder here.	O
Snoozing on a book and maybe this was originally going to be leaning up against a stack of books here, so I've got that as well.	O
I need to put in.	CHITCHAT
He needed tutorial.	CHITCHAT
Well actually I can walk you through the things that I use most often.	CHITCHAT
The main sketch tool I use is the blob brush, which is right here and it.	O
It creates the big difference between the blob brush in the paint.	O
First tool is the blob brush creates a fills.	O
So before the blob brush.	O
I guess a lot of artists would come in with the paintbrush tool and then they would expand in the lines later.	O
So when they're doing comics and stuff like that, and I think that was the thinking behind adding that tool and it kind of took out a step which is nice and I use it as my.	O
I use it as my sketch tool.	O
And then the pencil tool is what I use to fill in and colour stuff.	O
Do you have a channel on the YouTube?	CHITCHAT
No, I do not.	CHITCHAT
Why do?	CHITCHAT
But it doesn't have any UpToDate videos.	CHITCHAT
I do, however, have some speed paints on my Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I posted some ID TV videos that have, I think 2 two of them or three.	CHITCHAT
I have another one.	CHITCHAT
That I still need to post up, but you can kind of.	CHITCHAT
You can watch those there about 15 ish minutes long.	CHITCHAT
You can kind of see how I color things and do things in there, not step by step for any voice over yet, but just just the basic speed pace.	O
Yeah, so that's what I'm going to come back and do.	O
I'm going to go ahead and take a quick scan stretch break and I will be right back.	O
All righty, Um, taking a quick drink.	CHITCHAT

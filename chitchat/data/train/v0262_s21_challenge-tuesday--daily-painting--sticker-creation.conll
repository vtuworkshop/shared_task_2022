A good reading angle.	O
She's gonna have maybe always up like this.	O
That's a little bit of, uh, not good, possible.	CHITCHAT
Just came in.	CHITCHAT
Not really.	CHITCHAT
See my sketch.	O
I had a big book here.	O
So let's see what I was doing in my sketch that.	O
That kind of think.	CHITCHAT
Something that exists.	CHITCHAT
Could be.	CHITCHAT
Maybe she's holding on to it like that.	O
He said he wanted.	CHITCHAT
Now I still need to get that angle.	O
Trying to figure out the email that I want to book to the app.	O
Or maybe she's reading a paperback and it's folded over like this.	O
That could be interesting.	CHITCHAT
Let's move this side down a little bit.	O
Groups of subjects?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's what I get for not drawing in the group.	CHITCHAT
The side panel bit.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Now she's looking where she needs to be.	O
Let's go ahead and take out the face line.	O
I need to redraw this ear bit right here because her ear since her head is tipped, they're going to see a little bit of.	O
It's just gonna be a little bit instead like that.	CHITCHAT
Versus the in the line of her head leads you back that direction.	O
Yeah, I do need to smooth this out over here because I don't know what's going on there.	O
It's not the way it should be, and then I'm going to take my smoothie tool and just kind of clean it up a little bit.	O
And then because that kind of sometimes the smoothing tool, kind of.	O
Guests are some crazy ideas in its head.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't do what you wanted to do.	CHITCHAT
So in that case I just come in here and fill things in a little bit.	O
Looks like I went to a little bit of race are crazy there so that in little bit.	O
Model Monte Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Oh wow, all the way from India Nice.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
I am trying some cute stuff today.	CHITCHAT
Kitties reading, trying their best to clean a bookshelf but not really succeeding.	O
Because you know what happens when you open a good book.	CHITCHAT
You start reading.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's see I need to think about.	CHITCHAT

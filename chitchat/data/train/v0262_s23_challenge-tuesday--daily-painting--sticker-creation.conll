Strong enough layer, which probably shouldn't, but that's OK.	O
I'm doing it myself.	O
I just drew the lines in there.	O
Um, I just picked a point, drew him in and you know.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let me show you a more.	CHITCHAT
Let me show you a more detailed one that I did a while ago as a better example.	O
Library was around 1700.	CHITCHAT
Study.	CHITCHAT
You Press.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I need to do it differently.	CHITCHAT
We need to find it.	CHITCHAT
Find the number.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it's not long ago Dear Oh 1600 House off 500.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hold down here.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Let's chat here we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is an example of one where I set up a really elaborate grid.	O
And you can see that.	O
Here this was my original sketch and then this is the.	O
This is the adventitia singlepoint finishing point that I did to set up everything and get everything put together and then over the top.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let me actually move move this to the top so you can see how that worked out.	O
So I use that to define where all of my shelves were.	O
It helps with the lining of the books and you know, just the different elements I have here.	O
I put the ladder here 'cause I wanted something to give a sense of.	O
Some kind of depth closer to the viewer and so I have that right there.	O
I originally had some characters climbing open over it, but I decided in the end that I wanted it to be a little bit more.	O
Just a little bit less busy over here 'cause I wanted the you know her looking at her books.	O
Kind of silhouetted by the light to be the focus there, but that if I would have for this is I just want and I drew.	O
Sometimes I'll take the line tool right here and I'll use that to help me make my gridlines.	O
There is a perspective grid tool but I do not personally use it.	O
I know it is a very good tool.	O
You're doing a lot of.	O
Buildings in perspective drawings and stuff like that, I just haven't used it enough myself too.	O
To really put it into work here.	O
I did a lot of hand drawing practice for the different perspectives and so that's kind of what I follow.	O

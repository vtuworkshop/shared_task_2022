I just follow that and kind of draw it up myself and it's a good exercise to get into.	O
And if you do it enough, you can kind of kind of eyeball it.	O
You know, I wouldn't eyeball it on something really important, but for sketching purposes.	O
If you oh here, let me show the let's just do.	CHITCHAT
Let's do the outlines here.	O
There in the outlines for the Sky.	O
I always think it's fun to look at the outlines.	CHITCHAT
See everything that went into it.	O
This is when I actually did.	CHITCHAT
This is the.	CHITCHAT
These feed paint.	O
I recorded the process of painting this and I will upload it as a speed paint.	O
I may not do over voice over because I.	CHITCHAT
I didn't record it and I could probably just give my thoughts as I'm going through it, but.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so there's the.	CHITCHAT
Mirrors the regular.	O
Thank you Dave.	CHITCHAT
Yeah thank you Chris.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so this one is.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let me go back over here.	O
All right, so we're drawing up our details, missing here.	O
And I'm going to kind of flesh this out.	O
I have a little food here, I've got one that's kind of looking over.	O
Maybe this one has a little little mini duster.	O
Maybe they've got like a dandelion that they're using.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Intentionally, not good, but.	CHITCHAT
Their hearts in the right place, right?	CHITCHAT
I like that.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to have this one having with a dandelion so.	O
So this line art is a mess right now, but I have.	O
There's a method to my madness, I swear.	CHITCHAT
I like to keep the stuff in.	O
Pretty clear groups in case I want to move things around later.	O
Just giving myself the option.	CHITCHAT
So there we go.	CHITCHAT
Let me just fix this guy a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I didn't draw him nearly as details.	O
I wanted to, so I wanna come in here with my trusty blob brush.	O
Let's zoom in, you know, let's bring you down here.	O
It's clean up.	O
Some of these nested lines.	O
Impression.	O
So I'm gonna do here since these are pages curling over one another.	O
I'm gonna bring in these lines.	O
Just go ahead and take that might bring the lines like this.	O
This up here.	O
I think that's good enough for the purpose of this little tiny bit.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Welcome data.	CHITCHAT
Details are a lot of fun for me.	CHITCHAT
I can I can get lost in there working on in quite a quite often.	CHITCHAT

Make my details stand out a little more.	O
I have him.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I've got something weird at the top here.	O
Maybe this is like a flower.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna do the flour here.	O
At the top of this plan.	O
He's just getting ready to He's got his little thing sticking up out there.	O
Maybe not.	CHITCHAT
Alright, since no plant is perfect.	CHITCHAT
Just give him some little rips here and there.	O
Just to make it interesting.	O
Um, alright, so let's see these guys.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Let's fill in some details.	O
Let's do some fun stuff here.	CHITCHAT
Let the details.	O
Values.	O
So I'm thinking about when I'm selling this in, where is light coming from and where is it going to hit an not hit.	O
So let's take an easy one, for example.	O
This leaf is curling over like this, so unless the light is coming from underneath it, this underside is pretty much going to be on the darker side because he.	O
Is not getting a lot of light, so it's safe to put a little value there and like a little shadow there in the same thing under here.	O
I'm thinking about the areas that are going to get the most and the least like.	O
So I did a little bit of that when I started blocking in with lines.	O
That's what I was thinking about there.	CHITCHAT
I got OK.	CHITCHAT
Maybe these areas need to be.	O
On the real dark side.	O
Because they're going to be either very behind, other stuff are really far ball and and kind of see, you know the line art start to curl and get a little bit more depth now.	O
Let's do that with this guy to maybe just his little bit here.	O
His will get some light, but maybe not, maybe not.	O
So thinking too.	CHITCHAT
These leaves are kind of curling into bunches of other leaves, so white does not going to have as easier time getting in there, so maybe I can put a little something there.	O
Let's put it this way.	O
This is curling over here.	O
And let's see.	O
This is all pretty much.	O
In Shadow and not really seamless.	O
Change this.	O
Seneca now got a little bit of something.	O
On this guy to make him look nice.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
And let's not forget about this.	O
This space, so the base is.	O
Lights coming from above ish.	O

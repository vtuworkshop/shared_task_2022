We're gonna have a cash shadow of all these leaves.	O
Kind of coming right here.	O
He's going to be in general probably darker, but maybe we'll have some.	O
Coming in from elsewhere.	O
And this week is a little bit darker that are at the bottom.	O
That's kind of add a little bit more.	O
Kick it up a little bit more.	O
Wake up.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's save.	O
Alright, so there's my little side plant.	O
Let's zoom back out and see how we're doing here.	O
All right, I've got a nice frame over there about the plant.	O
I've got a book in front here I think I'm OK with just leaving coconut there.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But Let's go over here.	O
So what I have yet to address is something maybe up here.	O
Maybe there's am let's just do something simple.	O
Maybe there's a.	CHITCHAT
Really, I didn't even do anything.	O
Maybe there's a pretty yet.	CHITCHAT
Painting.	CHITCHAT
Rained over here.	CHITCHAT
I'm holding a.	CHITCHAT
It's another good quick tip.	O
If you're drawing straight lines, hold down the shift key and when using broad brush.	O
Hold down the shift key and that will automatically put your lines at the perfect angle.	O
It helps me to draw, uhm, certain things.	O
Like picture frames.	O
That Yeah, that one sitting off the wall is think about what's going to be inside this to.	O
Frame let's group in an.	O
Let's think about what he is actually going to have in there.	O
Let's just do.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Let's just let's just feast.	CHITCHAT
Let's just do it pretty like a flower or something.	O
Maybe it's an abstract art piece.	O
I can do a bunch of different colors there.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's see.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm at the stage where I can get rid of those lines and I can start some major racing on um.	O
'cause I do have these ground wise I'm going to have them on a hardwood floor, so I'm going to leave some of these in.	O
Ann Let's just start cleaning this up a little bit so we can get to the final line art and start calling.	O
Can I'm gonna grab this?	O
And I'm not go ahead and save it.	O
'cause I don't want to get rid of it.	O
I'm just going to paste it in front there and lock that layer back up again, come back to my main one, hide that an now I've got a little bit more clean.	O
Lines going on so.	O
I think I'm going to go ahead and come.	O
And see this is another thing that keeps it easy on you when you group things and then you have all of your positioning settled on.	O

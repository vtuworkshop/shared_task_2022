Really trending towards the rest.	O
I need to lose.	CHITCHAT
I need some salads hearing about the greens.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that'll do.	CHITCHAT
Just off the diner, the glass of water shoes now.	O
Thank you, Robert.	CHITCHAT
Have a good dinner.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So let's start with this fun little plant over here.	O
I'm gonna pick my green.	O
I have actually let's go ahead at the top and let's drop in this color for the flower 'cause it's going to be really right.	O
No one exchange so little bit just a little bit of something over there.	O
I'm going to take my green and I'm just what I'm doing now at this point is I'm just making color fills, but I'll go back later as I'll select these fills out of there dropping gradients.	O
Or I'll go in and do specific leaves that are going to be a different color that may not fit into the main fill, but I'm just getting shapes right now and still thinking about, you know the mood.	O
But I want.	CHITCHAT
Liam.	O
The different colors how I want the I've already planned out the light a little bit.	O
With him The values that I put in.	O
So now I just need to really think about colors.	O
And that's all scribbles, so I'm just going to fill in like this.	O
Come back over here.	O
Back And that's very vibrant.	CHITCHAT
That is really vibrant.	O
So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to make red gradient.	O
And let's let's let's ease off on the vibrancy a little bit.	O
And let's go to Hue, saturation and balance.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I'm like that maybe.	CHITCHAT
More.	O
Recognizing All right?	O
And then maybe?	CHITCHAT
Do I want to group?	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
I'll just keep the color it is.	O
So what I'm gonna do is, I'm gonna I know my top color is this so I need to come in.	O
Maybe something like this?	CHITCHAT
2 little bit here maybe.	O
Maybe take my.	CHITCHAT
And let's let's go to transparency.	O
And I kind of want to build this upper, low and slow.	O
Very.	CHITCHAT
Several sections here.	O
I will.	O
Come here with a yellow.	O
Hey.	CHITCHAT
Canon coming here and I'm going to go and make this bottom of my flower.	O
A little bit deeper.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Hence the fact.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Send you to the back.	O
Right?	O
Here we go.	O
Clean inside.	O
So we have these leaves on my some kind of folding over each other.	O
And let's pick the base color.	O
So this is going to be maybe a.	O
Maybe a clay pot?	O
I'm not to the back.	O

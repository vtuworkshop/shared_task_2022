Are using welcome.	CHITCHAT
Yes I am.	CHITCHAT
I'm using uhm.	CHITCHAT
I'm using a 24 pro.	O
And I'm still getting used to it.	CHITCHAT
Before I was using a.	O
The 13 HD.	O
And I used.	CHITCHAT
That one for years.	CHITCHAT
And it was a good good little machine.	CHITCHAT
And this is helping me a lot and be able to draw details and so like you know, some of the thoughts between the smaller tablet versus larger one would be, you know.	O
Arnie's army drawing a lot of detail or you.	O
How is your setup?	O
Uhm, you know, are you someone that sits up straight when they draw versus someone who doesn't?	O
I'm someone who doesn't, so that is a side benefit that I really wanted to.	O
Wanted to get because if I have this sitting up straighter and I'm less prone to Hunchy and doing that, 'cause I would hunch over you know a lot with a smaller tablets and this has me sitting up straighter which is helping my back helping my neck.	O
Helping you work longer.	O
So definitely some things to consider when you're thinking about getting one over the other.	O
If you're starting out, you know, I think definitely the work from one that's, I think, 13.	CHITCHAT
That's a great, you know.	CHITCHAT
Place to start and kind of if you're curious on digital art, you're not making as vague and investment as you know.	CHITCHAT
If you want to stick with walk home, that is.	CHITCHAT
As you know some other.	CHITCHAT
You know, like the pro series, but if you're looking at like Huey arms or XP pens, those give a lot of value for the money.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm done messing around with that one and so the next step is covering the rest of this, which will probably be about an hour and a half ish movie.	O
Just depends on how deep I go in.	O
Thank you so much as.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, that's me done for the day.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for joining me.	CHITCHAT
Next trip is going to be on Behance, is going to be on Thursday.	O
I started around the same time every Tuesday and Thursday I got 11:00 AM Central and Thursdays.	O
I like to do comics and I'm going to be doing a special comic which is to participate in a new design challenge on Behance.	O
They're doing a kind of a weekly drawing challenge for the Streamers.	O
And this week's topic is the Quarantine Awards, so I'm going to make a comic with all of my characters receiving their quarantine awards.	O
So like for example, happy paper will be since he's toilet paper, it will be the most elusive or momo cheat since she loves to do a lot of baking, she's going to be probably best Baker.	O
Or maybe, maybe she experimented a lot of people, experimented with making bread from scratch for the first time, so maybe that'll be.	O
Best scratch bread loaf or something like that.	O
Coconut most mischievous and you know I'm going to have to narrow down how many characters are going to get their report awards so and what those will be and how I'm going to lay it out because last time I did it, I did a scene where there are receiving it or.	O
A scene where they're kind of.	O
In action, to get the badge and then the actual badge design so it was kind of fun to design like five or six different badges.	O
Um, right.	CHITCHAT
It was actually just posted its in the discord, but I don't know if they've actually posted in anywhere else.	CHITCHAT
So if you see.	CHITCHAT
If you see other streamers with the hashtag, we can't.	CHITCHAT
We as a Behance Weekly Challenge, let me let me see.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
What was the official hashtag?	CHITCHAT
He just decided on it be handslide challenge.	CHITCHAT
Wait wait wait, yeah we can slide challenge so if you see streaming under that those those are the streamers of working on that challenge it, there's nothing really.	CHITCHAT
There's nothing really specific to the challenge except for the theme.	CHITCHAT
I mean, you can do whatever you want and it can be a comic.	CHITCHAT

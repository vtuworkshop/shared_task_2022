Welcome back to the stream.	CHITCHAT
Happy Tuesday, so sorry I couldn't make it to the stream yesterday.	CHITCHAT
I just wasn't feeling well, uhm, but I am back and we are going to be working on the Cinderella piece again today although.	CHITCHAT
I have some bummer news.	CHITCHAT
Um, it's not the end of the world, but for some reason my file last stream was not saved.	CHITCHAT
I don't know like it this file was what it looked like before I started my stream.	CHITCHAT
My last stream, which, uhm, I forget what it was, was it Friday, Thursday.	CHITCHAT
Thankfully, I do have a screenshot of where we left off last stream, so I'm just going to trace over that, but we will have to start the coloring over.	CHITCHAT
Thankfully, again, we didn't get very far on the coloring, but uhm, I don't know what happened because I have autosave on for every 5 minutes and like I got this screenshot for the be hands thumbnail.	CHITCHAT
But like I must have accidentally said no when it asked me to save the photo shop file or something because I I don't know what happened.	CHITCHAT
It's just like I opened the file this morning and I was like.	CHITCHAT
Wait a minute.	CHITCHAT
This is not where I left off.	CHITCHAT
But but think again.	CHITCHAT
Thankfully, thankfully we do have this, so not the end of the world.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, so I'm just going to go ahead and place this file over top and then just lower the Opacity and then we can.	CHITCHAT
And we can just trace trace it.	CHITCHAT
Is this new photo shop I'm hearing a lot of crab crab Mills with the new photo shop, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I I, I mean that's the only problem that I've experienced, which is probably user error.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I would assume, uhm, I don't remember what I did like.	CHITCHAT
I really don't, I?	CHITCHAT
I really don't I I don't remember Mike.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I didn't close photo shop before I turned off my computer.	CHITCHAT
Like maybe I didn't say.	CHITCHAT
But in that case then I would have gotten like a recovered file so I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I must have accidentally pressed know when I wanted to save.	CHITCHAT
Which is weird because I never do that.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, it's OK.	CHITCHAT
It's not a big deal.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I hope you guys had a lovely weekend.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, OK, I'm just going to do this on.	O
Separate layer, let's just.	O
So there's a couple of things that's different about this file.	O
Like this bubble is moved, I think that's the only thing that I moved, though everything else is the same.	O
Well, just move this guy over.	O
He clever how you doing welcome.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, and then everything else is the same.	O
The error is, humans are really felt things up, requires a computer and the human.	CHITCHAT
David says I'm not going to say that I've done that cancel out of the safe, but I know I know that it can happen.	CHITCHAT
I've done that.	CHITCHAT
I I seriously, I'm so blanking out on my memory on what happened there.	CHITCHAT
I really I really don't remember like that's gotta be what happened though.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's just.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I guess all.	CHITCHAT
Do that over.	O
That's pure black.	O
I don't want Peter Black.	O
What am I doing?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, so yeah, we're going to have to spend the first.	O

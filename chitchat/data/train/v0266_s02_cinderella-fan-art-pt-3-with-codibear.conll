First chunk of the stream doing this.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that guys.	CHITCHAT
Did you, since this is the first time we're talking this week, have you guys done anything exciting the this week or this weekend?	CHITCHAT
What did you guys do?	CHITCHAT
My husband and I are well, I'm watching him, but he's kind of like started going back through all of his favorite PlayStation games in planning them.	CHITCHAT
Just like for something to do.	CHITCHAT
A flattening platinum means like getting all of the achievements trophies by.	CHITCHAT
By the way, if none of you are PlayStation players.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so we've been like kind of doing that all weekend.	CHITCHAT
Just hanging out playing video games.	CHITCHAT
Nothing too exciting.	CHITCHAT
I do have a little bit time of- now that since this week the Adobe employees.	CHITCHAT
Have the week off for 4th of July.	CHITCHAT
I'm not modding this week, but I am keeping my same typical streaming schedule that I normally do at this.	CHITCHAT
8:00 AM Central time.	CHITCHAT
Right that.	CHITCHAT
Wasn't going to change my schedule up on you guys, I just wasn't.	CHITCHAT
I was planning on streaming yesterday.	CHITCHAT
I just didn't feel well.	CHITCHAT
I did my makeup and I was like, oh.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I can do this.	CHITCHAT
Ann Never says Howdy Howdy, nice illustration.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, thank you David.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I'm on vacation for the next week.	CHITCHAT
So nice.	CHITCHAT
So I've spent the first big bit just listening to records, reading books and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Nice, it's awesome.	CHITCHAT
We only have a 2 1/2 more months before we move, which is very exciting.	CHITCHAT
She said to the cloud, maybe Adobe rolled back, uh?	CHITCHAT
No, I I don't think I did save to the cloud I I don't think I've ever even used that feature before.	CHITCHAT
I don't even think I know how to save to the cloud honestly.	CHITCHAT
Just got to be a way for us to blame Adobe.	CHITCHAT
I really doubt it.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, it was probably me.	CHITCHAT
There's gotta be a way it wasn't my fault I gotta blame everything else but me know.	CHITCHAT
It was me.	CHITCHAT
I screwed it up, but again.	CHITCHAT
Silver lining.	CHITCHAT
I do have this file.	CHITCHAT
It could have been a lot worse.	CHITCHAT
I do have this file to trace over.	CHITCHAT
I would have been like so devastated if I didn't.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, I would have had to draw Cinderella over again, oh.	CHITCHAT
Me.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, yeah, I guess.	CHITCHAT
I mean I don't normally clean up my sketches, but uh.	CHITCHAT
This kind of gives me the opportunity to do that this time around.	CHITCHAT

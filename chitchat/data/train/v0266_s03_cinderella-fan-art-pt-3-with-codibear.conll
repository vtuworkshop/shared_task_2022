Guess the sketch was kind of relatively clean already.	CHITCHAT
Why do you have such a long vacation?	CHITCHAT
David, are you dumb like taking personal time off?	CHITCHAT
Or is it more so for, UM, Ovid?	CHITCHAT
Situations.	CHITCHAT
OK, that looks good.	CHITCHAT
Getting there.	CHITCHAT
This won't take too long.	CHITCHAT
Do you have to?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I just need to finish rolling Cinderella and then.	O
Um, the pawprints need to be drawn also.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Also the scrub brush.	O
We have a lot of vacation time.	CHITCHAT
Oh well, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Finally started making my own homemade Kiefer again.	CHITCHAT
Now that I'm back home, I took like a break off of it because I needed to buy my own Kiefer grains again, and they had a delay and shipment because of Ovid.	CHITCHAT
If you don't know what key for Is, It is fermented milk, sort of like it's sort of like yogurt, but it's a little thinner than yogurt.	CHITCHAT
It's really good for digestion.	CHITCHAT
Since I have colitis and I make.	CHITCHAT
He first smoothies every day.	CHITCHAT
Pretty good.	CHITCHAT
I just started doing it like a few months ago.	CHITCHAT
Fermented food is really good for.	CHITCHAT
Digestion issues.	CHITCHAT
They must like like I started making my own sauerkraut too, and my own Pickles.	CHITCHAT
All those types of fermented foods are really good.	CHITCHAT
No, Jennifer has said that she has our viewer, Jennifer.	CHITCHAT
As silly X disease also.	CHITCHAT
OK, now I gotta do OK her rag.	CHITCHAT
He wins.	CHITCHAT
They've been welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, my file.	CHITCHAT
My photo shop file didn't save last stream, so I'm having to trace over what I drew in my last scream.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but it won't.	CHITCHAT
It shouldn't take too long.	CHITCHAT
Almost done, which graphics tablet to use?	CHITCHAT
I use a Wakeham Intuos Pro and this is a medium size.	CHITCHAT
Well, come into Uspro.	CHITCHAT
David says me and my dad are starting to explore fermented food too.	CHITCHAT
Oh nice, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I, uh, I'm starting to learn a lot on just like searching YouTube and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Come back when I was first diagnosed with colitis.	CHITCHAT
There was not nearly the plethora of information online that there is now about people just trying to to find their own treatments and things like that because.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise, I mean it's a terminal illness, so otherwise I mean you'll take pills the rest of your life.	CHITCHAT

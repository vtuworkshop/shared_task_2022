But the pills don't always work for everyone, so.	CHITCHAT
Um people kind of have to try to find their own ways of doing things and figuring out what works for them.	CHITCHAT
And there's a lot of GI doctors out there for some reason that think that.	CHITCHAT
The food that you eat has no effect on colitis.	CHITCHAT
So it's really hard.	CHITCHAT
But I've heard that a lot of people I've had a lot of success consuming fermented food.	CHITCHAT
OK, now I'll say I'm just going to save the UM.	CHITCHAT
Or, you know, I could instead of just rolling the UM.	CHITCHAT
Pause in sketch form.	O
I could just go ahead and do the final form of the pause because I already have this sketch down.	O
Um, so, uh, let's just go ahead and make.	O
The color group.	O
And we will do thee.	CHITCHAT
Turn.	CHITCHAT
Often.	CHITCHAT
Does ale count no.	CHITCHAT
Ale does not count.	CHITCHAT
I'm really not a.	CHITCHAT
A hobby drink person.	CHITCHAT
Anyway I am.	CHITCHAT
Is ale yeah it's a type of beer.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, uhm, I yeah, I'm really not a beer person honestly.	CHITCHAT
So I'm OK with that.	CHITCHAT
Actually it's funny enough.	CHITCHAT
Ironically, um, beer is like one of the worst things that people with colitis can drink.	CHITCHAT
I guess it just has to do with the phone, but like Oh, I cannot.	CHITCHAT
I cannot drink beer like I don't like the taste, but it also just never sits well with me either.	CHITCHAT
It never really occurred to me that that's fermented.	CHITCHAT
That's kinda funny.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for showing you know problem 7.	CHITCHAT
You have any other questions?	CHITCHAT
Feel free to ask.	CHITCHAT
Nope.	CHITCHAT
Looks good, um now I'm gonna go up to the pawprints again.	O
I still don't really know what color I want to do everything.	O
But we will figure that out as we go.	O
I missed some little.	CHITCHAT
Our goal lines gotta get all the little sparkles.	O
It now.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to go ahead and do.	O
The physical Brown that I do, like the sketch Brown 'cause it's kind of like a dark black Blackie, brownish.	O
For now, and I'll probably change it later.	O
We're just going to go with that for right now so I can get it down on the canvas.	O
Hey Sean, Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
So for those of you that are just coming in um.	CHITCHAT
For some reason, my photo shop file was not saved and we were left with.	CHITCHAT
This UM, for some reason when I open my file this morning so I had to trace over my screen shot that I had of it.	CHITCHAT
Thankfully I had a screenshot, so that's kind of what we're doing.	CHITCHAT
We're just like catching up on the work that we lost.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
Hope you all had a lovely weekend.	CHITCHAT
Brown color for her will actually.	O
Cinderella is blonde so we will definitely be doing blonde hair.	O
It's a home brew and make my own wine.	CHITCHAT

All that's awesome, Steven.	CHITCHAT
Are you guys missing me Adobe live streams?	CHITCHAT
I kinda feel weird now that I'm uh.	CHITCHAT
I'm used to watching them every week.	CHITCHAT
It feels weird that they're not that they're not on right now.	CHITCHAT
Teaching moment maybe?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't I if you're referring to me.	CHITCHAT
Shawn Yeah I, I really don't know what happened to my file.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, my theory is that I accidentally, um.	CHITCHAT
Like closed out of the.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
The window when it asked me to save or something because I have autosave on for every 5 minutes so it had to have been human error when I went to close photo shop and I just said no don't save or or something like that.	CHITCHAT
It had to have been in something along those lines.	CHITCHAT
Are you rotating the artboard if you press the the R key on your keyboard, that is the rotate tool.	O
And if you press the escape button, it will bring it back straight again.	O
So R for the rotate tool and escaped to bring it straight.	O
And teaching you were teaching us?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, exactly, don't you.	CHITCHAT
Don't do what I do, just um.	CHITCHAT
Do as I say, not as I do.	CHITCHAT
Always save your files.	O
It's weird because.	CHITCHAT
Like an eye, even.	O
I even consistently press CTRL S throughout my streams and stuff too.	O
You know, like are usually, I don't know what happened, so and it the file is as if I like miss that whole 2 hour stream.	CHITCHAT
It was like it looked before I started streaming so I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's very weird.	CHITCHAT
And I looked in other files and like another file photo folders in case I like just like saved it with a different name and saved it elsewhere, but I didn't see it anywhere.	CHITCHAT
So unless I saved it, maybe I saved it to my desktop.	CHITCHAT
Oh I don't know guys.	CHITCHAT
Mystery.	CHITCHAT
But it's OK.	CHITCHAT
We're pretty much almost caught up already.	CHITCHAT
Just need to see.	CHITCHAT
Need to erase the flooring behind her.	O
Let's copy a layer of the flooring just in case they don't like it or something.	O
Let's just erase these fit.	O
And then once we color the.	O
Um Grout and the diamond tiles will be all caught up.	O
In my photo shop, alt key is for selecting duplicate layer.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Mice deleted it there mad because they're not saying Oh my gosh, you're right.	O
I completely forgot to draw the mice.	CHITCHAT
Oh Oh man, how did I do that?	CHITCHAT
I'm 7, uhm.	CHITCHAT
What are you trying to do exactly?	CHITCHAT
What would you like your alt key to?	CHITCHAT
Um to do?	CHITCHAT
My alt key, my right alt key is for color selecting.	O
I can't remember if that's the default.	CHITCHAT
Um, if that's the default key or not.	CHITCHAT
I could have swore that it was.	CHITCHAT
I don't remember changing it.	CHITCHAT
Up OK friends, we good now.	CHITCHAT

OK let's.	CHITCHAT
Just going to bring this layer down here an let's just go ahead and condense all of these layers down.	O
Actually know what yeah offerings are up here, OK?	CHITCHAT
It's just that is an empty layer.	O
That's an empty layer.	CHITCHAT
Two.	O
What am I doing with my life?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK.	CHITCHAT
Condense all these layers down.	O
OK, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Now let's bring this.	O
Up to 100% that we can grab this blue color.	O
And let's make this layer underneath the pawprints that it's going to.	O
Diamond I also So also let's turn down the opacity of the edge.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Better.	CHITCHAT
And let's turn on this one.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Funds it looked like.	CHITCHAT
So there about the same width.	O
I just wanted to make sure that I'm using the same brush that I had.	O
Or same size brush that I had for the ground, which it looks like it's about the same.	O
Oh that's good.	CHITCHAT
But for real though, Sean thank you so much for reminding me because I'm probably I'm gonna go back and um.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go back and draw on the mice a little bit.	O
I don't even.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I'll do a sketch for the mice.	O
I think I'm just gonna like block them in with color because they're going to be pretty simplistic.	O
But I gotta add in Gus, Gus, he's my favorite.	O
Viscous is Syracuse.	CHITCHAT

I'm going to grab going to color this child first because last time I forgot it.	O
I'm pretty sure it was strong that reminded me.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you got that one.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, so I'm definitely going to need to change the color of the pawprints because there's definitely not enough contrast against this dark blue.	O
Um, although I'm really not entirely sure that I'm going to use this direct blue, so.	CHITCHAT
And I guess I'll just picking up these lines a little bit.	O
We're getting there.	CHITCHAT

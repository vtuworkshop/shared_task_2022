You know what?	CHITCHAT
That's funny.	CHITCHAT
I actually didn't color that one.	O
Oh, it's her hair, I didn't.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
That's why?	CHITCHAT
I didn't color it last time was because I uhm.	O
I mostly had her hair that right there, so I'll color it in this way.	O
And then I'm going to go back.	O
Let's make that layer invisible.	O
And, Uhm, Let's trace over that for the new sketch.	O
It was this layer.	O
Make her.	O
Here go down this.	O
I don't want any tangents actually.	O
Let's make her hair.	O
Oh wait.	CHITCHAT
Running around like that, so they'll probably only be a little bit of the tile showing if anything.	O
Architectural details look awesome.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
We went with a very forced perspective for the flooring, obviously because it's completely flat, so picenum.	O
Uh, taking a leap of faith here that this will turn out well.	CHITCHAT
Other one that I did with a completely flat floor was, uhm, the cafe 1.	O
Which I am having, I I do really like how this looked, but it was a smaller's portion of the illustration where the flooring texture was flat.	O
So this is the first one that I've ever done where there's like a big portion of the flooring that's really flat.	O
OK, so got that in there.	O
Yeah, so that tile might not even show it all, but we got it colored nonetheless.	O
Uhm, OK.	CHITCHAT
OK friends, we are caught up now.	CHITCHAT
Come, let's edit this tile.	O
This one is looking a little weirdly shaped here.	O
So here mode.	O
Lines are looking good.	O
I think that's pretty good, OK?	CHITCHAT
Um, now let's make a layer over top of everything an let's fill it with black.	O
And then if we go down to color blending mode, we can see our values of the of the drawing.	O
Oh, definitely like to hang out at that cafe.	CHITCHAT
A man me too.	CHITCHAT
Honestly like it looks like a nice warm warm place.	CHITCHAT
I would love to go to a cafe like that, especially if the other patrons are cats.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK, yeah so uh with the.	CHITCHAT
Operants being like this same exact value as the.	O
Blue tiles we definitely need to.	O
I'm probably going to make the operants darker.	O
Um, let's desaturate them and make him a little darker.	O
Let's lock the transparency on that layer and I'll just grab the.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hard round brush.	O
Probably going to need to make him a little darker.	O
It's a little better, but not quite what we need.	O
And I might even actually make the diamond tiles color a little lighter.	O
Cindy saturate OK, by the way I'm going to go grab.	O
A screenshot from the movie so we can have a reference to look back on for the colour palette.	O
Things we.	CHITCHAT
Hiding GAIL.	CHITCHAT
So those of you that aren't familiar with the scene, this is what the tiles look like.	O
Uhm, I'm going to be using like my own color palette, but we're kind of going to be using this as a guide for what the environment usually looks like.	O

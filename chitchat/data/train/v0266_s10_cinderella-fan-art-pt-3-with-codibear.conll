And I have some macho tea because I definitely needed caffeine.	CHITCHAT
Today I have a Winnie the Pooh mug.	CHITCHAT
Honey bear, that's what my husband calls me honey bear, he's upset that's who I am as his contact in his phone.	CHITCHAT
And funny enough, I've actually had this mugs.	CHITCHAT
That's like way before I knew him.	CHITCHAT
I've had this mug since I was like, uh, a little kid.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
And I'm not really a huge fan of this black.	O
I feel I'm feeling like it's a little bit too desaturated.	O
Um, what if we did one of these Browns?	O
Or the pawprints is that 20?	O
That's too Brown.	O
It's too saturated.	O
Let's start in that.	O
That's not enough.	O
Value difference.	O
A little better.	CHITCHAT
Maybe just slightly darker, slightly more desaturated.	O
And I might use this same Brown but lighter for her dress, because her.	O
Got her dress the bottom half of her dress is like a light Brown in the top is a dark Brown so probably use this same Brown for her dress but just different values of that Brown.	O
Ah, ha ha ha PPP OK?	CHITCHAT
Let's do I'm feeling like we should do that.	CHITCHAT
I'll next because that's such a big portion of the illustration that it's going to really change the look of it once we figure out what color were going to do for the tile.	O
So if we look at the original, it's more of like an aquamarine, like a teal color.	O
Uhm, although this color palette is really cool colored, cool toned Ann, I usually work in warm tones, so I'm probably gonna try to pick a warmer version of this color.	O
Kind of similar to what I did for the diamond tiles.	O
Like that's definitely not the same color, but it's similar.	O
Kind of like my own version of that color.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
We grab actually let's grab this color and just.	O
Alter it a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Let's go pretty warm.	O
What I could do?	CHITCHAT
Is.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, I'm going to make a new layer underneath the diamond tiles.	O
This is more so like what the color kind of is.	O
In the scene, this is like a pretty cool tones.	O
Teal color But if I mix.	O
I don't know how well this is going to work, but we will experiment if I mix some yellow on top of it.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Not that much.	CHITCHAT
Might warm it up, let's try.	O
It looks like a very muddy color.	O
I'm not really a fan of that.	O
Former That might look better.	O
And if not, if I go in color all of this and I don't like it, we can always change it.	O
Never really used this kind of like teeley color in my work before.	CHITCHAT

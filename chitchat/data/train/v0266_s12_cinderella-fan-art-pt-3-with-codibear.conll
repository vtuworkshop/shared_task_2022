First, getting first getting started with digital art, uhm?	O
You know I had those same questions to like well were like there's so much to learn.	CHITCHAT
Where do you begin, right?	CHITCHAT
Like where do you begin to start finding that information and.	CHITCHAT
Start figuring out.	CHITCHAT
Um, where?	CHITCHAT
What kind of direction you want to go with your work?	CHITCHAT
And funny enough, you know, like I mean, within my um.	CHITCHAT
When I was first getting started with digital art and stuff I I went through so many different styles like an I did not come.	CHITCHAT
Grow up thinking that I was going to do like this style of work.	CHITCHAT
I did not think that I was going to grow up.	CHITCHAT
Or that I was going to do like children's work, Belgians, illustration.	CHITCHAT
But that's just kind of like my own style.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of found me eventually.	CHITCHAT
Like the more that I, the more that I practiced in, the more that I explored working and the more that I studied other peoples work.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
The more more and more I realized how I wanted to draw things.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, a lot of the time I'll go.	CHITCHAT
I'll find artists that I really love and I'll save their work.	CHITCHAT
You know, in a folder like favorites list or something.	CHITCHAT
Um, and I'll.	CHITCHAT
I'll really seriously analyze.	CHITCHAT
Analyze their art.	CHITCHAT
I'll open up and I'll look at it deeply.	CHITCHAT
I'll look at all of the details and be like, OK, this person, for instance.	CHITCHAT
This person drew this rock this certain way.	CHITCHAT
How can I and I love that?	CHITCHAT
How can I incorporate that in my own artwork without stealing their style?	CHITCHAT
You know, like, how can I?	CHITCHAT
Draw it in a way that is similar to that, but maybe adding my own flair to it.	CHITCHAT
Like my style, for instance, is a culmination of not only how I just naturally draw, but also influence from a bunch of different artists that I have loved over the years.	CHITCHAT
And just studied their work and that goes for not only just um, the way that they draw things, but also their colors that they used to.	CHITCHAT
For a long time, you know, as I was still learning color theory an I still am.	CHITCHAT
I'm certainly no expert in color theory, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Would again, like I would just analyze other artists colors and how they used color.	CHITCHAT
And study I really love the idea of relative color.	CHITCHAT
We talk about relative color on my stream quite a lot.	CHITCHAT
And I would.	CHITCHAT
I would study their work and I would bring their artwork into Photoshop and I would actually color drop their colors that they use just to learn like, OK, this is exactly the color that I'm looking at and I love that color.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to color drop it and I'm going to see how they used it.	CHITCHAT
Eventually I over the years I morphed that into my own colors because I personally really love Earth tones and dark.	CHITCHAT
Like dark jewel tones in dark earth tones and warm tones, there were definitely points in my art journey where I veered away from that and I could feel in my heart that like this isn't me.	CHITCHAT
Like this is not the artwork that I want to make.	CHITCHAT
I'm more so being influenced by the artist that I love too much so it doesn't feel like it's my artwork.	CHITCHAT
I'm being influenced too much so I'd have to reel it back in and be like OK Cody.	CHITCHAT
Stay true to yourself, they true to your colors that you want to use.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so you know eventually, if you're if you're really focused on like finding your style or whatever it is, don't worry about finding your style there.	CHITCHAT
Every single artist that goes through finding their style like there's always that grass is greener syndrome of.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I wish my artwork looked more like this.	CHITCHAT
There were some there were so many times.	CHITCHAT
Uhm when I was younger where I would, I would feel that way about a bunch of different styles, like whether it be realism or just I don't know just any kind of different style and I would envy their artwork because I hadn't come across my own style yet and I hadn't refined my work yet.	CHITCHAT
But don't worry about it.	CHITCHAT
You know it, it will.	CHITCHAT
The more you learn and the more you draw.	CHITCHAT
The easier it will become to decipher how you want to differentiate your artwork from other people's artwork and it will become your own.	CHITCHAT

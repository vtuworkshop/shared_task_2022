You will have your own voice in your own style.	CHITCHAT
You don't.	CHITCHAT
You actually don't want your artwork to look like another persons art, because then you don't have your own style right that person you love their artwork because they have their own voice.	CHITCHAT
You want your artwork to have its own voice, so don't get lost in Indian wanting your artwork to look like other peoples out right?	CHITCHAT
Because you want your art to look like your art.	CHITCHAT
I know that was like super long tangent rant thing, but.	CHITCHAT
That is what I have experienced.	CHITCHAT
And it can be really hard sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Getting into those moods, especially with social media, to the way that it is, you know, don't worry about the numbers if that is something that you're looking into as a beginner.	CHITCHAT
Is starting an Instagram for your art and stuff like that?	CHITCHAT
Don't worry about the numbers, it's irrelevant.	CHITCHAT
This focus on focus on your own artwork and the people will find you.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I didn't see your earlier message, Mia Mia says, I'm still in new with pencil paper an I'm trying to pass that into digital, but I find it really hard yet.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so um, I didn't find my personal style and I say that very loosely because I just say that as I just drew the first illustration that eventually became like the style that I have now.	CHITCHAT
But a lot has changed over those years, but the first time I drew in this style with like the dot eyes and stuff like that was about six months after I.	CHITCHAT
I graduated high school.	CHITCHAT
Um, so I was like 18.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I wasn't even painting in Photoshop.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I was using paint tool Sai.	CHITCHAT
Um and I look back on that.	CHITCHAT
And Oh my gosh I it's so bad you know I might be able to find it.	CHITCHAT
It was a Commission for.	CHITCHAT
A friends PlayStation podcast.	CHITCHAT
Ann I might Oh, there it is.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, this was the first.	CHITCHAT
This was the first ever omm emit.	CHITCHAT
I'll wait, no that's Facebook go away.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
This one, this one right here on the right.	CHITCHAT
This was the first ever illustration that I did in my style an it was of my two friends.	CHITCHAT
And it's so bad.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
His eyes are like up in his forehead.	CHITCHAT
They don't have noses.	CHITCHAT
Uh, this was in paint tool Sai.	CHITCHAT
The anatomy is horrible.	CHITCHAT
I have my watermark.	CHITCHAT
This is a really low resolution but I have like my deviant art watermark going up the side here.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, it's so bad but yeah, so that was, uh, let's see how long ago that was 2011.	CHITCHAT
So that was like almost 10 years ago.	CHITCHAT
That Hey Anna, how are you doing?	CHITCHAT
I haven't seen that one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah Oh my gosh, it's so bad and you can see how, um, how look at how, how much my my art has changed since then, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Why isn't there we go look at the difference in in the colours like Oh my gosh I.	CHITCHAT
Let me bring it back up again.	CHITCHAT
The colors that I was using back then like you can absolutely tell that.	CHITCHAT
I I my knowledge and color theory was.	CHITCHAT
Much more minimal because none of my colors in this illustration are cohesive.	CHITCHAT
They're all just like the actual like normal colour like.	CHITCHAT
None of them mesh together like my colors do now.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so it's just you know you kind of learn these things overtime and for me personally, like.	CHITCHAT
I will sometimes I'll try something over and over and over again and it will.	CHITCHAT
I will continue to fail and fail and fail until one day just suddenly I'll have this ahha moment.	CHITCHAT
I'll have this epiphany and it suddenly works and then I get it.	CHITCHAT
I'm like Oh my gosh I finally got it.	CHITCHAT
Whoa, Oh my gosh, there's a screenshot from my old stream.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT

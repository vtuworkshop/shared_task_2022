Oh, is that probably like 2015.	CHITCHAT
Wow, that's funny.	CHITCHAT
Else doing Disney Art again.	CHITCHAT
Wow we have come full circle my friends.	CHITCHAT
Doing Disney Artica.	CHITCHAT
That is funny.	CHITCHAT
He hadn't developed.	CHITCHAT
You're working pilot.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, exactly.	CHITCHAT
We were just talking about Mia was asking for big tips for beginners and I was just talking about.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like The journey of envying other peoples styles and learning color theory and all that.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how long you've been here, Anna, but yeah.	CHITCHAT
I love your stickers.	CHITCHAT
Anna, by the way, I keep seeing them on Instagram whenever I open it up.	CHITCHAT
It's like oh, here's an A sticker.	CHITCHAT
Really Cute.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and Mia was also saying that, um.	CHITCHAT
They, um.	CHITCHAT
There are currently doing artwork on pencil and paper.	CHITCHAT
I started out that way too that I meant I meant to say that earlier I started out that way to all I don't.	CHITCHAT
I doubt I can see any of my pens with my old pencil illustrations.	CHITCHAT
They're probably not on deviant art, but.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I started out that way too.	CHITCHAT
I did not start out digital up until a little bit before I started.	CHITCHAT
I did that one illustration of my friends that was probably around the time that I really started doing digital an I just got a tablet and I would say.	CHITCHAT
Um suggestion with working with the tablet is that some people find the hand.	CHITCHAT
I disconnect kind of difficult at 1st and some people can't really get over it, but I would suggest if you get like a cheaper wakeham tablet like this like or if you get this is an interest pro or if you get a cheaper one like the bamboo or I think it's the intuos one they call it now.	CHITCHAT
Because it doesn't have a screen you're drawing down here and you're looking up at your screen.	CHITCHAT
Personally, don't have an issue with it, but it did take me along time to get used to it.	CHITCHAT
It is very weird when you're not used to not being able to draw where you're looking up, but some, like I said, some artists can't get over that and they prefer to draw on a screen so they get the more expensive tablets called this antique but.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I would say give it at least a couple years just too.	CHITCHAT
I mean, of course it all depends on your budget but.	CHITCHAT
But give yourself some time with the intuos.	CHITCHAT
Give yourself a lot of practice time because you might get used to it and you might like it.	CHITCHAT
And I'm actually starting to go back to traditional a little bit here and there.	CHITCHAT
My main artwork is.	CHITCHAT
Still digital, because that's the most experience that I have, but at this point, but I would really love to learn to paint properly and I have been all open it up on I think.	CHITCHAT
I think I have some pain.	CHITCHAT
I've been trying to learn the paint with Gouache, um, wash paint, and watercolor.	CHITCHAT
Here's my here's my Behance.	CHITCHAT
I have a few little gouache illustrations that I've done in my notebook.	CHITCHAT
This, uh, this sketchbook I don't know if any of you guys are familiar with him, but um, jazz, a draw with Jazza.	CHITCHAT
He gave me the sketchbook as a gift.	CHITCHAT
He's a you tuber, he's a really fun guy.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Here's one little gouache painting that I did.	CHITCHAT
I'm I'm still quite a beginner at painting and also blending colors because blending paint is so much different than mixing colors digitally, so it's a much different process like I feel like my color theory, just like goes right out the window when I'm when I'm using regular paint, so it's like I'm completely different thing.

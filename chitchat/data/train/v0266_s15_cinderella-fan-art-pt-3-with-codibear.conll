Here's some watercolor carrots that I did I learned a lot on.	CHITCHAT
Hum for watercolor process and wash.	CHITCHAT
Actually I learned a lot on Skillshare.	CHITCHAT
I use, uh, uh, somebody is like free trial.	CHITCHAT
You bomb for like a month and man I packed in that time because I learned so much like some of their tutorials are really great and in depth so much better than than what's available on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
Uhm yeah.	CHITCHAT
Loves Skillshare.	CHITCHAT
It's really great.	CHITCHAT
Here's another little gouache painting that I did.	CHITCHAT
I just simple little bear drawings because I don't know how to do anything more complex than that right now.	CHITCHAT
And funny enough, you know.	CHITCHAT
Let me open up that that bear sketch again because I've noticed that because I am so used to drawing with a tablet.	CHITCHAT
Difficult for me to sketch and a sketch book because I'm so used to having the luxury of an undo button, so I'm much more successful doing my sketches digitally.	CHITCHAT
An I did this sketch digitally and then I put it up.	CHITCHAT
I held my painting book up to a window and I traced over this digital sketch and that made it a lot easier for me.	CHITCHAT
I didn't actually do my sketches in the book.	CHITCHAT
Traditionally I did them digitally.	CHITCHAT
It's hard for me to draw with a pencil these days.	CHITCHAT
And it says I found that one sided illustrations with my mouse.	CHITCHAT
For years I found that getting used to the pen on my intuos with so much easier.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, I'm sure going with the mouse is an.	CHITCHAT
So much different, more so much more difficult.	CHITCHAT
Girl how you draw with a mouse?	CHITCHAT
That's crazy.	CHITCHAT
I know like there are some some awesome illustrators out there like they're really rare.	CHITCHAT
Uh you and far between, but there are some pretty incredible illustrators that paint with a mouse.	CHITCHAT
Pretty insane.	CHITCHAT
When you get you a little white box, I know.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
That's definitely on my list of things to get.	CHITCHAT
I definitely would love a light box.	CHITCHAT
You're using GIMP.	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness, I've never actually used him before.	CHITCHAT
I've only ever in terms of uhm.	CHITCHAT
Painting programs I've only ever used.	CHITCHAT
Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Well, first I started.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I started off in paint tool Sai which is not a bad program at all.	CHITCHAT
It's like $60.00 one time payment.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it's not a bad program at all.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, and then after that I was using Photoshop 7.	CHITCHAT
It was the photo shop before.	CHITCHAT
CC or yeah, it was.	CHITCHAT
It was Oh my gosh, it was not see see, it was before CS.	CHITCHAT
It was Photoshop Seven which was really old.	CHITCHAT
UM.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I think.	CHITCHAT
I upgraded to CS6 after that, but then after that I started working for Adobe for the Twitch stream.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And that's when I switched to CC, and I've been using CC ever since.	CHITCHAT
Don't use it.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
You know guys, once we finish this that coloring the tiles is taking quite awhile, but it is also like 90% of the illustration.	CHITCHAT

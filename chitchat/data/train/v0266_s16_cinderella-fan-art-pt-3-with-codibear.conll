So once we get this done where actually mostly done with it, I feel like the thing that's going to take the longest after this to color is Cinderella.	O
Just because she has multiple colors but it shouldn't take too long.	O
After this.	O
I don't think will finish it this stream because I've also been talking a lot and stuff, but.	CHITCHAT
Probably next stream will finish it.	CHITCHAT
Will figure out what we will draw next.	CHITCHAT
You know guys I was.	CHITCHAT
I know this is like super far in advance but I was thinking about doing my own inktober list this year.	CHITCHAT
Last year I did Inktober.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I completely forgot to color in this.	O
Corner for the.	O
The edge there but yeah, last year I did Inktober all the way through all 30 days for the first time ever an I had so much fun I have.	O
I was able to also make a lot of pieces that I have in My Portfolio and I really love them so I wanted to do it again and I wanted to do last year I followed somebody elses list and I wanted to do my own list this year but.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I lost my train of thought, but my husband and I are moving mid September.	CHITCHAT
Um, and I'm feeling like, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
So I stream three times a week.	CHITCHAT
I would want you guys to see all of the illustrations rather than doing one illustration a day.	O
I'm feeling like I might.	CHITCHAT
Just do like a few a day on stream so you guys can watch all of them.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And in that case I will have to come up with my list.	CHITCHAT
Pretty soon I should probably start thinking of my list pretty soon, because, um, with being busy with packing and everything, I don't want to get too distracted and we were driving across country.	CHITCHAT
So as that's going to be like a week trip, so there's like a week gone right there at least.	CHITCHAT
And then we have to get all set up and stuff again once we get to our new place.	CHITCHAT
So going to start thinking about Inktober list if any of you guys want to be involved and do my list I would be happy to have you involved.	CHITCHAT
Or you guys can also give some suggestions for my list too?	CHITCHAT
Um, I'm probably gonna do.	CHITCHAT
Probably going to do fall theme things.	CHITCHAT
Um, some artists don't do fall themed things, but I feel like October is like my favorite month of the year and I can't miss out on doing.	CHITCHAT
Halloweenie fall things, especially since the majority of my art is like fall themed anyway.	CHITCHAT
Um, so gonna start figuring out what that list will be like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that'll be a lot of fun for a little community project.	CHITCHAT
If any of you guys want to do that.	CHITCHAT
Especially if you've never done inktober before.	CHITCHAT
And of course, no pressure on doing.	CHITCHAT
You know every single one.	CHITCHAT
Just do whichever ones you want.	CHITCHAT
Or you know how I did it last year too.	CHITCHAT
Is that I did follow along with the list of another artist I used.	CHITCHAT
Actually I'll link her stuff because her work is really awesome.	CHITCHAT
I used Rigoni's link on a list on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know, yeah.	CHITCHAT
I I met so many really awesome artists through her this last inktober Is really great.	CHITCHAT
Um and some of the.	CHITCHAT
I put the majority.	CHITCHAT
I followed her list, but for the ones that I felt like what the themes that I felt like weren't really driving with me or my style, I came up with my own.	CHITCHAT
My own prompt for that day, so there were a handful of ones that I did for my own for my own prompt.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, and those are actually some of my favorite ones like that came out of the October.	CHITCHAT

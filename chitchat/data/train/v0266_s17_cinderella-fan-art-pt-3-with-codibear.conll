If you want to see my inktober's from last year, if you go on my Instagram and just Scroll down a little bit and once you get to this, There's like a big chunk where there's like, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Just like black and white and orange illustrations, those are my inktober's from last year.	CHITCHAT
And I usually do like last year I did.	CHITCHAT
Like Inky Textures for the.	CHITCHAT
Photoshop brushes.	CHITCHAT
They are still digital.	CHITCHAT
I didn't do traditional because I've tried to in traditional in October.	CHITCHAT
In the past an because I don't have experience with it.	CHITCHAT
It was just too difficult for me to keep up with it.	CHITCHAT
So I was like, hey, you know, I'll just do it digitally and I really like how they turned out.	CHITCHAT
I used.	O
I used watercolor texture actually, just like black watercolor texture and some inky textures.	O
And yeah, it looks pretty good.	O
And I added some like hints of orange in there too.	O
OK, did I finish sweet sweet?	O
Let's fill in some of this white just a little bit more.	O
Want to have too much weight.	O
Sometimes if there's too much white surrounding another object, it kind of loses its silhouette, and it makes a little bit busy on the eyes.	O
So I just want to go back and kind of clean up those lines.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Think I need to make this line a little oops little thicker.	O
Go to the diamond tile layer and I'm just going to thicken up this edge of this line.	O
Um, same with this one here.	O
Looking good.	CHITCHAT
Right, I cannot this one a little bit.	CHITCHAT
And this.	CHITCHAT
And this one.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and I also need to go back and color this part.	O
I'm thinking I'm probably do.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'll probably do the walls in the pillars a little bit darker cream color than we have for the background right now.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's save I had not saved that entire time I was doing the tiles.	O
Oh my gosh, OK.	CHITCHAT
OK um.	CHITCHAT
Yes, so picking a cream color.	O
Or we can paint Cinderella.	O
Next I was going to.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about doing the background first, but uhm.	O
Might paint Cinderella next and you know what?	O
Maybe we should pick a darker background color, or maybe that.	O

Would help.	CHITCHAT
Oh no.	CHITCHAT
Erase Button race tool.	O
We failed you.	CHITCHAT
It's OK, it's OK, I figured it out.	CHITCHAT
We did not lose anything, no worries.	CHITCHAT
Quite yellow.	O
We moved it over to.	O
Kind of like that because it looks a little vintage.	O
Having that yellow overcast always makes things look really vintage.	O
Do background color white for a second.	O
I think I like that.	CHITCHAT
Specially since Cinderella such an old movie and it's got that vintage vibe.	O
Think.	CHITCHAT
Vintage Disney is my favorite.	CHITCHAT
I'm not a huge fan of like I say that I'm a big Disney fan, but that mostly I mostly mean I'm a pan of vintage Disney and I'm also a fan of Disney Parks and not a huge fan of modern Disney.	CHITCHAT
Although I did really like Moana and.	CHITCHAT
I loved Rapunzel.	CHITCHAT
I was.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry tangled.	CHITCHAT
I was obsessed with tangled when it came out.	CHITCHAT
Not a huge fan of frozen sorry.	CHITCHAT
Not I saw it once I saw the second one to know like it's alright and I can understand why little why little kids like it.	CHITCHAT
But it wasn't my favorite.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I do not like wreck it Ralph is Disney 2?	CHITCHAT
I do like wreck it Ralph.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's do the bubbles.	O
I think I'm going to do them in the background color and I'm just going to do a let's lower the opacity of these tiles here.	O
So I actually did not like them.	CHITCHAT
With the opacity lower.	O
We do it this color instead, or man.	O
Oh, you know what?	CHITCHAT
I like that color.	O
Heretic.	CHITCHAT
Blasphemy.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's turn, whoops, let's turn down this opacity.	O
Um, values are looking pretty good the the operands are still kind of getting lost in that blue colour.	O
Maybe we can make them a little darker, but.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Move them over to yellow a little bit maybe.	O
OK, but Rapunzel Moanna Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I mentioned those of that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I I really love tangled.	CHITCHAT
When I was, uh, when it came out, Moe Anna.	CHITCHAT
I did like the movie but I like there are a couple of things in that movie that I really love but I still felt like the soundtrack was kind of.	CHITCHAT
Kind of lackluster, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Sarah, thank you so much for the following.	CHITCHAT
Be hands.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Um, the second version was better than the first I would agree with that.	CHITCHAT
I didn't, they still weren't.	CHITCHAT
It's still not my favorite series, but I would agree that the second one is better than the first one.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's color if anyone else is following me on the hands.	O
By the way, thank you so much for the follows.	CHITCHAT
I can only ever see who's following me like on my notifications when I get them on my phone, so that's the first one that I've gotten.	CHITCHAT
But I've noticed that when I stream I only get like 2 notifications out of like maybe 10 sometimes.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, see, it's like a It's like a total little girl movie and I try to think about it from the perspective of a little kid.	CHITCHAT
Like if this movie came out.	CHITCHAT
When I was young, would I have liked it is?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I don't know, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to say.	CHITCHAT
I'm still kinda bummed but Disney got rid of their 2D animation studio like there's literally not going to be a single 2D animated movie anymore like they completely disintegrated the entire 2D Animation Department.	CHITCHAT
Rachel, welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
I think I missed how you managed to create the texture.	O
Is it your brush style?	O
Yeah it is.	O
Uhm I use a brush called Contact Fran.	O
I'm unclear mode, it's called contact cran, so it's actually got a cran texture.	O
This is brush made by Kyle T Webster, um.	O
If you have Photoshop CC you can actually download his brushes for free.	O
If you have your brush in hand and you right click and you go to the gear and you go to get more brushes.	O
It will open up your browser an you can download all of his.	O
These are all of his different packs of brushes and the content Korean is actually in the Mega Pack here this one.	O
Um, and also my sketch brushes in that Mega Pack as well.	O
The sketch brush that I use that emulates this pencil texture is called happy HB so can't ekran an happy HB then.	O
I also use his watercolor brushes a lot.	O
I really love his watercolor brushes.	O
Got a really nice structure.	O
Oh, your nieces are my age for some reason.	CHITCHAT
When you said nice because I know you're older than I am Steven, but for some reason when you said Nice, I just assumed you were talking about a little girl.	CHITCHAT
So your your nieces are your niece is a year younger than me?	CHITCHAT
Um, that's funny.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I I just personally didn't really like it that much, but so awesome thanks.	CHITCHAT

Not really feeling it.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it's a little bit too cool, toned, uh, let's that's funny.	O
It's really not that cool toned, but in comparison, it kind of feels a little cool tone.	O
Maybe it just needs to be a little bit more saturated.	O
There goes that relative color.	O
Again, we always talk about I'm on multiplies.	O
Let's talk about relative color on this stream alot.	O
Um, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Now it's really cool tone.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe maybe it just needs to be more saturated.	O
See what our values look like.	O
Um might need to, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's dark in it just a tad.	O
And same goes for this.	O
Saturated in darken it a little bit.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Not that much.	O

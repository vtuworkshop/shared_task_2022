I suggested she watch your streams on his office even.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, also, uh?	CHITCHAT
Uh, by the way, Pierre Yeah, welcome to be hands, um, if you're looking for anymore, be hands live streams, usually Adobe.	CHITCHAT
the Adobe employees actually do a daily all day long stream, but they are not streaming this week because they have the we cough for Independence Day in America.	CHITCHAT
So they're not on this week, but usually they are.	CHITCHAT
So if you're looking for like tutorials on any of the Adobe programs, they usually do tutorials.	O
But then you can also find are just like freelance artists like me just doing their own personal stream too.	O
And I usually go on three times a week.	CHITCHAT
Around this time I start at 8:00 AM DST.	CHITCHAT
Usually like Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Monday.	CHITCHAT
Tuesday, Wednesday I'll usually post on social media when I'm going live.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you know what I?	CHITCHAT
The front metric and of her dress look like because I think I.	O
Oh yeah, her a shirt underneath actually doesn't show on the neckline.	O
That's really interesting.	CHITCHAT
I never noticed when I was doing the sketch.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, so from the front you can only see this blue part on the sleeves.	O
So, uhm, I'm thinking about doing this color and just lightning it up quite a bit.	O
And then let's do.	O
Gives.	CHITCHAT
I'm back to Kantak ran.	CHITCHAT
I absolutely love.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Um, like powdered blue and Brown together.	O
I think that's such a great color combo.	CHITCHAT
This isn't necessarily powdered blue, it's more of like a Robins egg blue.	O
But it's similar.	O
Turn off the sketch for a second actually and see where we're at.	O
Yeah, that looks a lot better without the skin.	CHITCHAT
I like that, uhm.	CHITCHAT
But accidental whiteline kind of outlining her.	O
I think that looks really nice.	CHITCHAT
I might add that in along the dress here a little bit, because the	O
Yeah, and on her shoulder too.	O
I might add that in a little bit, just so is a little bit more contrast.	O
I'm really liking the vintage E vintage vibes were getting here.	CHITCHAT
So in comparison.	CHITCHAT
I like to.	CHITCHAT
I like to put my artwork on a white background.	CHITCHAT
A lot of the time, just like every once in awhile.	CHITCHAT
I don't like to work with a white background, uhm, but I will just kind of check It on a white background like this every once in a while, mainly because.	CHITCHAT
Uh, most social media has a white background.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, and sometimes my colors end up being too dark or too light an it just looks really weird on a white background because I'm used to the I'm used to seeing the contrast of a dark background on photo shop, so I really can see the yellow when compared to white as opposed to like when you have it against this dark background, your eyes start to get used to it and it almost just looks like white.	O
Because there's so much contrast, but if you compare it to white, like pure white instead, you can really see how yellow the colors are.	O

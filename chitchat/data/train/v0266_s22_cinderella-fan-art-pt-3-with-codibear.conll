OK.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's do some little line detailing I think on on her dress.	O
But the fact that I'm going to you know what?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I won't.	CHITCHAT
I don't think that I'm going to do her dress exactly as the background color I'm going to make it a little bit lighter.	O
Maybe let's do.	CHITCHAT
Say this needs to be the Slayer needs to be above the dress an below her sleeves.	O
This will be apron.	O
Yeah, I might do it just a slightly lighter than the background, because that way will still be able to have texture on her dress, otherwise it would just be a solid color.	O
Still not pure white.	O
And comparison.	O
This is pure white so you guys can see the difference on that.	O
So it's still quite yellow.	O
But it's just a little bit lighter, so we can see that background color underneath.	O
This is also probably the same exact color that I will do for the pillars in the back wall as well, because those are white in the scene.	O
So we're going to be working with the cream tone.	O
Now that looks good.	CHITCHAT
Very similar to the background, but there's still some texture.	O
Hey guys, welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
How have you been?	CHITCHAT
How was your weekend?	CHITCHAT
Oh, and I also can't forget that her shoe or a little shoe down here is black.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Here's a picture of her shoot here we go now.	CHITCHAT
She's got really dark black shoes, so I'm probably going to do her shoes the same color that we did the pawprints, because that's definitely the darkest color in the illustration so far.	O
It definitely looks black.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
We also can't forget to draw in all of the little bubbles around here.	O
But they're covered with the flooring layer right now, but there's a bunch of bubbles coming out of the.	O
Bucket OK, let's go back down here.	O
And let's draw in her little.	O
Apron Bo.	O
Make sure I get some nice crisp edges.	O
And a little ribbons.	O
A teen welcome to the stream.	O
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Let's go back.	O

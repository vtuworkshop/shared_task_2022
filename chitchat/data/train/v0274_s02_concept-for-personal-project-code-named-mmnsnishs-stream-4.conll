Dreadful.	CHITCHAT
Horrible intern.	CHITCHAT
And you can just go to her.	CHITCHAT
Her artstation check out some of her work.	CHITCHAT
And this particular one is a bit of a collaboration.	CHITCHAT
Going to be pretty sweet was going to shut her out on the story, but I forgot and I was going back to do that.	CHITCHAT
Then I just realized this taking way too long, so let's just get to it.	CHITCHAT
Last one here going to the discord on the hands.	CHITCHAT
2nd.	CHITCHAT
And Dunzo.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Soon.	CHITCHAT
Of your joining.	CHITCHAT
That have no history on this particular.	CHITCHAT
Maybe watching the replay or whatever and you don't know what this is about.	CHITCHAT
Project meniscus is is a personal project going to sound like a broken record, but you know this is.	CHITCHAT
After all, different people come in at different times so we don't know who's watching when they're watching.	CHITCHAT
That all of you joining.	CHITCHAT
Thank you again for being really, really appreciate you, uhm?	CHITCHAT
What's Manish misses his code name or something.	CHITCHAT
It will be revealed later.	CHITCHAT
In the mean time, we get to hold on to a little bit, little bit of prestige by not revealing what it is I know it gets people excited.	CHITCHAT
And it should.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
This is this is specifically to make.	CHITCHAT
An original product to to make 3D figures of my studies, and if you guys have seen any of my work before we followed me maybe on Instagram and then ended up over here.	CHITCHAT
You know what?	CHITCHAT
My studies are more than likely improve.	CHITCHAT
You can also check out my project here on Behance portfolio profile, part of it and you can see.	CHITCHAT
Some of that.	CHITCHAT
And so the the concept is very simple.	O
All it is is just, you know this.	O
Neo Samurai Future Post Apocalyptic.	O
Cyber Punk.	O
Thing that a lot of people are doing.	CHITCHAT
Uh, and.	CHITCHAT
I'm just making studies of that and the.	CHITCHAT
The main gimmick for for the figures in this case is that they all have a different mask.	O
Something middle eat this I know makes me sad too.	CHITCHAT
There it goes.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
The gimmick is that they're wearing a mask, and it's usually or not.	O
Usually it is a mask that is specific to a culture.	O
The first wave that I'm doing is all.	O
Japanese inspired.	O
Just as far as the aesthetic, this is an only that you see in the background.	O
This is the first one I did, so he's he's the roughest.	O
Is when I'm going to come back to eventually.	O
Once we go full circle too.	O
Make him look a little more refined.	O
But Yeah, so I guess there are gang members.	O
And they're fighting each other, maybe, or there fighting the man.	O
Who knows?	CHITCHAT
Maybe a robotic oppressor.	O
Maybe the robot uprising has already happened.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
The story isn't quite that fleshed out, you know, so.	CHITCHAT
It might be that, oh, you know what it should have been on its own layer.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Better.	CHITCHAT
And dumb.	CHITCHAT
So my terrible intern is trying to build a portfolio for herself.	CHITCHAT
Again, you can check out her art station on the.	CHITCHAT
Description.	CHITCHAT
She's already designed the character.	CHITCHAT
I don't think she posted it on her on her heart station, but.	CHITCHAT
But she she.	CHITCHAT
She sent it to, you know we were collaborating via text.	CHITCHAT

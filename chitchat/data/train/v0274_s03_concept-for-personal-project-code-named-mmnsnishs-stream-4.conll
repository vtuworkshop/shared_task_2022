And.	CHITCHAT
Since she loves cats and I despise cats, I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I really don't like him anyway.	CHITCHAT
She decided that she wanted to make the.	CHITCHAT
The Neko won the cat one.	CHITCHAT
Is very excited to do it and.	CHITCHAT
Again, I keep repeating myself.	CHITCHAT
She did a great job.	CHITCHAT
I really like what you did with it.	CHITCHAT
And she made him into a.	CHITCHAT
Like a merchant.	CHITCHAT
Some sort.	CHITCHAT
And it's a weighted cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking at it right now.	CHITCHAT
He's got like these.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's called he's like little discs.	CHITCHAT
Some kind of sash coming off of it?	CHITCHAT
And then my God drape.	CHITCHAT
With a really cool hood.	CHITCHAT
Now the only problem is that the hood has the ears on it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I like that personally, but maybe that's not necessarily bad.	CHITCHAT
And the other thing that I don't.	CHITCHAT
Like as much as that he's got robotic legs and hands.	CHITCHAT
And I feel like it's a little too much now since it is supposed to be like a post apocalyptic thing, right?	CHITCHAT
You know, it's.	CHITCHAT
Not exactly.	CHITCHAT
Unrealistic in the genre for them to have, like cybernetic pieces?	CHITCHAT
I do know that originally I wanted to kind of keep.	CHITCHAT
The first wave, without including any of the cybernetic stuff, but maybe I'll maybe I'll just.	CHITCHAT
Go with it, you know.	CHITCHAT
Let's go with it anyway.	CHITCHAT
Sketch this in Black 'cause I like the text jet it leaves if I draw over it in Gray.	O
And just with that, we have enough there to.	O
Have a nice little, uh?	CHITCHAT
Base we're going to merge that.	O
And we are going to carry on.	O
He's got like a big old belt, let's see.	O
Everybody has her in pants in the future.	CHITCHAT
Erin pants with strap ease.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, don't limit the universe.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I know I just.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I originally I just really wanted it all to be since in my head I was kind of just designing.	CHITCHAT
The heroes of the story, not that they're necessarily heroes, but just the hero of the story.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I kind of wanted them all to be human.	CHITCHAT
The part I don't.	CHITCHAT
I think visually she did a great job on this piece.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I just the part that I don't like is just.	CHITCHAT
It's too much cybernetics like I just feel like it's a little bit too much.	CHITCHAT
And it takes away from from.	CHITCHAT
From like the study, look in away.	CHITCHAT
Once everything is robots like is it all robot I don't know.	CHITCHAT
But Again.	CHITCHAT
It's OK, she she gave it this wicked.	CHITCHAT
Like Tiger looking mask, it's not a.	CHITCHAT
Not so much of a cat.	CHITCHAT
It was more of a more of a big cat, more of a Tiger cat then it is.	CHITCHAT
Would you call it?	CHITCHAT
Then it is an actual cat and it's a Golden mask.	CHITCHAT
She already called it and everything in.	CHITCHAT
And it's all pretty sweet, so there's just a couple of little things that I'm going to switch around.	CHITCHAT
To be closer to like what the static.	CHITCHAT
That I've been establishing so far.	CHITCHAT
As she worked off of like 2 sketches.	CHITCHAT
So she did great.	CHITCHAT

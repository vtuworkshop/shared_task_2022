So we're just going to go above all of it right here.	O
Girl trustee pencil that we've been using.	O
Start kind of cleaning things up here.	O
Oh, that is not cleaning up.	CHITCHAT
So the The The one thing that uhm.	CHITCHAT
It's weird optical illusion that isn't quite right.	O
So I gotta consider that that some of these faces might be peaking through the mask that way because I don't know that they're all going to be solid like this one.	O
These eyes would be hollow.	O
In the mask you know.	CHITCHAT
And since they are these hollow, and they're so close to the face underneath and underneath that face is going to be just the.	CHITCHAT

I know I just feel like.	CHITCHAT
To me, part of the charm for these.	CHITCHAT
I felt it was nice that the one thing they had that was like traditional was like the mask, you know.	CHITCHAT
'cause that's kind of the whole point.	CHITCHAT
It's that juxtaposition like.	CHITCHAT
Post modern.	CHITCHAT

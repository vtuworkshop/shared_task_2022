I like to think.	CHITCHAT
I'm better now.	CHITCHAT
I did have more experience.	CHITCHAT
I'm a little things up, a little bit better.	CHITCHAT
Jamie, if you want to show some progress on what you're doing, I'd love to see it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to foreshorten feeling this right here is very angular, very like flat.	O
I'm actually going to.	CHITCHAT
Or shorten death.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And then movement downward.	O
So you can tell.	O
Thank God.	CHITCHAT
Remember the character too.	O
Oh, this was a tire.	CHITCHAT
What the heck?	CHITCHAT
Now remember.	CHITCHAT
If you remember, but I don't remember how long.	CHITCHAT
As sort of a relaxed mode.	O
And I have been like this.	CHITCHAT
Little Bend.	O
Move the hand down.	O
A lot of that.	CHITCHAT
Have a question?	CHITCHAT
Current guidelines?	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it is too many circle like circles and already focus on actual character.	O
Any advice?	CHITCHAT
OK so.	CHITCHAT
As you can see, what I'm doing right now and I'm very sketchy, I'm extremely sketchy right?	O
And you have to kind of.	CHITCHAT
Can I have to use like the circles and lines as guidelines?	O
These aren't the lines that you're actually going to use for your final.	O
Product right?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Like how I like use my sketch is that you know I put a layer over it.	O
Like after I do my schedule per layer over and then I refine it and then sometimes I'll do that a couple more times.	O
There is this misconception where.	O
You have to get it right the first time, and that's not always the case.	O
This is this right now this is me figuring out this process.	CHITCHAT
This part of it is me figuring out what the hell I'm doing 'cause I don't even know what the hell.	CHITCHAT
The idea is there, but how we actually looks can be very, very different.	CHITCHAT
And be messy.	CHITCHAT
Don't be.	CHITCHAT
Don't be afraid to be messy.	O
Don't be afraid to have all those lines because like the wonderful thing about you know, especially if you're doing, did all the wonderful thing about using digital is that like I could stack play on the right hand side, I could stack so many layers, right, Anne?	O
The only thing that really matters is like the end product.	CHITCHAT
All of the stuff in between like This Is.	CHITCHAT
This is your figuring out of phase.	CHITCHAT
This is your like.	CHITCHAT
I'm just trying to.	CHITCHAT
Get whatever is in my head on here.	CHITCHAT
And it might not be 100%, but.	CHITCHAT
You know, I believe they might guy June 2 a direction where it's like.	CHITCHAT

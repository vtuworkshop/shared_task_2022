Oh wow, I didn't think it was going to be like that.	CHITCHAT
If you tend to do a lot circles, does Fresno not not right now?	CHITCHAT
At the moment there are no guide circles.	O
There is a cool ruler tool like this.	O
On the lower right hand side.	O
Make nice straight lines, that's nice.	O
I don't tend to use it 'cause even when I to traditional work, I liked her free, handsome.	O
Or freehand it.	O
An my proportions and my stuff is all over the place, so make.	CHITCHAT
All over the place.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
Camden I hope I hope I answered your question.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it's it is also bad that I don't really think about what to draw when drawing.	CHITCHAT
I just kind of go for hey I'm too it's in, that's intuitive, intuitive creation and that's valid.	CHITCHAT
That's a valid thing.	CHITCHAT
We get psyched out.	CHITCHAT
At least I do.	CHITCHAT
I've met, I've met.	CHITCHAT
In my coat and Kurt career, I've met professional artists.	CHITCHAT
An some of them will admit like they don't know what the hell they're doing.	CHITCHAT
They're just drawn things, doing revisions, you know, changing things all the freaking time.	CHITCHAT
Then that's fine.	CHITCHAT
I kind of think of it like if you worked at a company like if you're making a video game and let's let's take a popular video game like Mario or Sonic the Hedgehog there were before founding the Hedgehog was Sonic the Hedgehog.	CHITCHAT
That was like probably 100 drawings from the art Department going like.	CHITCHAT
How do we make a hedgehog look cool?	CHITCHAT
They did not get it the first time.	CHITCHAT
I can tell you that I can guarantee they did not get it the first time, there just figuring it out and then they had drawn, drawn, drawn drawn figure it out, figure it out until someone day everyone's like a holy crap that's that's exactly like what we thought about.	CHITCHAT
I'm exactly I think that's going to work guys.	CHITCHAT
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
And then everyone high fived each other.	CHITCHAT
Then Sonic the Hedgehog was born.	CHITCHAT
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
Right now I don't know what the hell I'm just making.	CHITCHAT
I'm I'm tapping into what I usually do.	CHITCHAT
Or what my cumpas experiences things I've seen before.	CHITCHAT
I just like being what works or what's going to work.	CHITCHAT
I just dropped people.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should think of a narrative, or you don't.	CHITCHAT
And you can like that complex awesome too.	CHITCHAT
Thinking of the story when you're drawing something fun back story.	CHITCHAT
You know, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
At the same time, you know it also offer cold to draw in weird stuff.	CHITCHAT
Find hardware and craft.	CHITCHAT
Is there a story to those now?	CHITCHAT
Not really.	CHITCHAT
It's it's like Mad Max beyond Thunderdome.	CHITCHAT
Sort of what everything looks like.	CHITCHAT
Hey, looks cool.	CHITCHAT
I don't like how did I, I'll change it.	CHITCHAT
Right, that's fine.	CHITCHAT
The people say like Arts Arts a great way to kind of relax and let your brain kind of go free.	CHITCHAT
I think Instagram has conditioned us a lot of artists, especially the younger's, to think like what we make has to be amazing.	CHITCHAT
Like Max and doesn't right?	CHITCHAT
Sometimes amazing, sometimes like the messy stuff, can inspire your next work and you know you Draw Something and it's like, oh, that's a weird like Marshmallow Dragon looking thing.	CHITCHAT
You don't really think anything of it sick since made later you look at it again.	CHITCHAT
It's like all the crap I'm going to make something of this.	CHITCHAT
And then you just made the next Harry Potter.	CHITCHAT
It can be fun, are going to be fun.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't have to be.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't have to be a.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to be the next Kim Genji or the next Jim Lee or the next like.	CHITCHAT
Flu ish or the next?	CHITCHAT
You know whatever you just be like, hey, I just want to make I just make it all I want to make a 9 tailed octopus like that's what you want to do and that's cool too right?	CHITCHAT
Nothing is wrong with that.	CHITCHAT

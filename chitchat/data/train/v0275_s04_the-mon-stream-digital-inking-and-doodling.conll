I turned to math with this moving and flow of the pencil.	O
Do you have any specific settings or do you go out default?	O
I usually do default, I'm very basic, I know a lot of people to customize their their feel the more I can stick to default them better I'll change things sometimes.	O
Like if I'm thinking if I'm thinking I will go to the smoothing.	O
Right here and then I'll adjust it a lot of times, like if I'm sketching.	O
I don't know why this is so high when I'm sketching.	CHITCHAT
I put it as low act, have a little bit of drag.	O
I can't hang around there.	CHITCHAT
That works.	CHITCHAT
That's cool, that's cool by me.	CHITCHAT
As you can tell by the music in my demeanor, I'm very chill.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't necessarily need a whole bunch of fancy stuff.	O
It's the Gen X are in Maine.	CHITCHAT
I'm just like whatever.	CHITCHAT
I don't wanna have a good time, you know survived hang out.	CHITCHAT
The default pencil, though, is actually really, really nice.	O
I like this compared to a lot of other iPad apps.	O
Pencil's.	O
They just it seems more the grit I believe of it.	CHITCHAT
It could be my iPad though, because I think like that even at a slight angle it kind of initiates it and I draw on.	O
45 degrees.	O
So I have to like draw like this, so I'm going to put in.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put into tech support like hey, can we get?	CHITCHAT
We tighten that up a little man.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Tighten it up and taking it out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like for well this like my iPad is first generation though it's old, it's like 5 years old, but if you ain't if you angle your pencil you get that.	O
Here you angle it like that, but if you think about like this when you get the line and it changes various degrees.	O
But me I like cross hatching.	CHITCHAT
This is fine if I'm doing concept work, but if I'm actually like doing stuff I like to see the I see that.	CHITCHAT
'cause I grew up like drawing like this with mechanical pencils.	CHITCHAT
That's how I do stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm assuming all of y'all are artists.	CHITCHAT
Are all heard of those when I'm streaming?	CHITCHAT
I am very much like very much open for people to show their work off.	CHITCHAT
If they're willing to.	CHITCHAT
I like looking at people's work.	CHITCHAT
I encourage people to do that.	CHITCHAT
Show off their work.	CHITCHAT
Kind of get.	CHITCHAT
Can I get there?	CHITCHAT
Get their feet wet.	CHITCHAT
When it comes to like.	CHITCHAT
Critique and Shyness and what not.	CHITCHAT

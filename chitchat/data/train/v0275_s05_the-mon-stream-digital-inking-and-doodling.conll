I don't think you're really thinking you're just kind of doing.	CHITCHAT
You're putting your putting on the flat tones and trying to get a feeling rather than being precise.	O
See this like I think you're just trying to be, well, animation.	O

You gotta think about your line work like that.	O
You have to be looser.	O

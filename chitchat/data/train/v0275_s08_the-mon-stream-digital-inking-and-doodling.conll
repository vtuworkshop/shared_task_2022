Is a lie.	CHITCHAT
It's it's a flat piece of paper, or it's a flat I computer screen, right?	CHITCHAT
You're supposed to let you are incense, incense.	CHITCHAT
Making The illusion of three dimensional 3 dimensions.	CHITCHAT
So how do you do that with, you know?	CHITCHAT
Value with color with you know, shapes.	CHITCHAT
That's how you do it.	CHITCHAT
OK so.	CHITCHAT
'cause we aren't made of lines.	CHITCHAT
That is what it is and This is why my art teacher taught me.	CHITCHAT
We're not made of lines.	O
We aren't OK.	CHITCHAT
So the less dependent you are on the lines, the more like kind of real things are.	O
Yeah, of course we're going to have comics anatomy and stuff that is just one way of doing it, so if you're getting stuck on the line part, maybe like throw away.	CHITCHAT
That way of thinking.	CHITCHAT
For now and then try to learn more about shapes when trying to learn more about value highlights, you know things like that composition.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Instead of trying to.	O
You know, get so stuck on the line.	O
Right, that's one way of thinking of it.	CHITCHAT
Who and why isn't this?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, so that that's Why.	CHITCHAT
Then I can cut into this right here.	O
We've seen a lot I'm going to.	O
I'm going to merge this kind of right now.	O
Great sound.	CHITCHAT
Merge to down.	CHITCHAT
Even I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Yes baby, I'm kind of cutting into it now, making the precise.	CHITCHAT
A basic Rule of thumb.	O
Is when you're starting something.	O
OK, here how you're drawing and what you're doing should always be loose in the beginning.	O
And then as you're drawing it, it could be ski.	O
Tighten it up so.	O
Another thing my art teacher that Tommy Luce to tighten.	CHITCHAT
I'm beginning, you're very, very free.	CHITCHAT
You're just making shapes or just doing whatever, right?	CHITCHAT
And then tighten it up.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know why this is red.	O
After I added color later on.	O
Right now I'm just adding things to make things at this interesting like this looks like night or, like you know, something like that was like dude just add shapes.	O
Maybe the clockwork might think that I'm adding things to it.	O
I'm going to make this piece of armor.	O
My God.	CHITCHAT
That's all I have offsets.	O
The other side is I got this big shape on the on the left hand side, like right here I got that shape.	O
And I want a big shape on it right here to kind of balance it.	O
See this like that right here.	O
Like I like that and I like that little shadow drop shadow right there.	O
I like how I did that.	CHITCHAT
My own crap, my add some.	CHITCHAT
Oh, now that's vector.	O
I might add some.	O
Green and this somewhere I don't know.	O
Or not I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm not very good with color.	O
I'm kind of like boosie bad with color hugs.	O
Mom still learning do.	CHITCHAT
Because I have a stream on be hands, does amino more professional you know me?	CHITCHAT
I'm just like you guys, I'm normal.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I don't have a resume at DreamWorks.	CHITCHAT

So I don't put milk in it, I just eat it.	CHITCHAT
I say it from the box.	CHITCHAT
No Shama don't care.	CHITCHAT
Did you use a website to make portfolio or did you send folder over?	CHITCHAT
The days are sending folders over is over here.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I should say the days of sending soldiers over over.	CHITCHAT
When you apply to a job or you know we tried to get work or what not having an online portfolio really really helps, but even then I've heard talk that if you have a very strong art station or a very strong like LinkedIn or something where you post your work, your current work like that works just as well.	CHITCHAT
You don't have to have like a Christy sanderson.com, which I'm pretty sure she does have.	CHITCHAT
It's be cute.	CHITCHAT
Well, like.	CHITCHAT
I've heard some people say that they would rather have an artstation because it's easier to navigate rather than some fancy.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Flash.	CHITCHAT
HTML, whatever thingy and they have to click on this and click on this to get to your portfolio.	CHITCHAT
It's like oh here username.	CHITCHAT
There's your portfolio.	CHITCHAT
OK, there you go.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna Reno.	CHITCHAT
I looked at your stuff I will consider you 'cause remember there not judging you on how nice your website looks or judging you by your heart.	CHITCHAT
After matters.	CHITCHAT
Also, it's more reputable, at least then what I think more reputable if you do it on a social media site, 'cause the likelihood of you.	CHITCHAT
You know, forging your work is a little bit less because there's some sort of accountability to it.	CHITCHAT
I made a website in this kind of question about what you mean, questionable, like, shady.	CHITCHAT
Questionable.	CHITCHAT
Sketchy.	CHITCHAT
Is your website front for Bitcoin?	CHITCHAT
Electronic currency is already talking about that what you mean.	CHITCHAT
Are you doing illegal day trading on your website?	CHITCHAT
Shame on you.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kidding.	CHITCHAT
That's a joke.	CHITCHAT
Like the design is bad.	CHITCHAT
Simple is better.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to make a fancy looking.	CHITCHAT
They don't care if.	CHITCHAT
Click on your name on your site and then it has a big Ol Explosion Veni an like you know.	CHITCHAT
But that doesn't matter if it's if it's clean and legible, as long as it doesn't look like you know.	CHITCHAT
Something from the 1990 years I.	CHITCHAT
Even professional is better than flashy and like full of notes of stones.	CHITCHAT
That's what I.	CHITCHAT
That's that's how I believe that's what I believe.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna turn this off.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
No he not too bad.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, don't worry about.	CHITCHAT
I just find out not playing.	CHITCHAT
There's a Facebook video playing.	CHITCHAT
I'm wondering if you can hear it or not.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know that right now, like it doesn't pay for choir.	CHITCHAT
If it's too unique that it's confusing for the person as a visiting, that could be a turn off.	CHITCHAT

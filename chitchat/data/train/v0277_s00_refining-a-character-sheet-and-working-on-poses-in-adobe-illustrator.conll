Alright, just getting set up will start in the moments.	CHITCHAT
Couple messages to send out.	CHITCHAT
Illustrator organized.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
And for ready to go.	CHITCHAT
So welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
Happy Monday in whatever time zone you happen to find yourself in.	CHITCHAT
I'm continuing my work on this Chicken Yellow character.	O
If you joined me on Saturday, we worked on a character turnarounds.	O
And so a turn around is a basically a layout that takes your character and looks at it from the front beside three quarter view and a rearview.	O
From there, once we had that turn around, we worked on some character expressions.	O
And and then wrapped up our day.	O
So tonight what I want to do is show you a little bit of the work that I've done in in the mean time to get prepped for today.	O
Just cleaning up this turn around a little bit and what I want to do today is block out this character an work on some poses later this week into the weekend will actually get into Adobe after effects and start to do some rigging and then eventually properly animate this character instead of just sketching it.	O
But tonight will also add that color back in.	O
Make sure we have a nice color palette defined for the character and go from there.	O
So if you're joining in the chat, please say hello love to know who's out there and where you are and what you're up to.	O
If you have questions, please feel free to ask.	O
Drop him in the chat and I would be happy to answer if you have work that you want to share.	O
Would love to check it out.	CHITCHAT
We can share it on the stream if you like as well.	CHITCHAT
But I think I think that's it.	CHITCHAT
So hey necklace.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for joining.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's mix stuff.	O
So since since we were last here, I decided to add one more view to my character turn around, which is a three quarter rear view.	O
So now you kind of have that full rotation starting with the front view slowly turning to the side and then turning to the back, and so again the idea behind the character shape is to give you or an animator.	O
You're working with.	O
Their other artists are reference so that they know what your character looks like in all of these different.	O
Situations, the more you can add to this, the more notes you can add.	O
The more useful this is a tool not just for you, but again for people that you might be working with so you know some of the things that I might do here would be to label some of these expressions that we created as well as just that.	O
A little bit of detail about the character we added a little bit of info including his name, last time.	O
So for those of you who work here, this character is chicken yellow.	O
Chicken yellow came from the idea rather came from her friends who let me go outside the color version here.	O
This is the original version of chicken yellow, so the idea for this character came from a friend who, when they first came to the United States and was learning English in their language, they didn't have a word for yolk and so to him the center of an egg.	O
He just referred to as chicken yellow and I love that was just awesome.	O
I thought it be really fun to make a character based on that and so chicken yellow is basically an egg yolk, but with bird parts.	O
So we've got beacon eyes and you know, he.	O
My thought is that chicken yellow broke out of a hard boiled egg and came to life and liberated himself and so that is what we're working with tonight.	O

In our last stream, we got the original turnaround created and some fun expressions with the help of the chat.	CHITCHAT
And tonight we're going to add a little more detail and start working on some poses.	O
So not just facial expressions, but getting a little bit more dynamic will start by blocking out blocking out this character.	O
The other thing I just wanted to share is that I did do a little bit of work on just cleaning up a color palette for.	O
For chicken yellow, I will probably end up turning this into Swatch is or library in.	O
In illustrator so that I can then use that in other tools to wherever I'm working on.	O
This character always had these colors easily defined.	O
So we've got one thing to do.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Quick quick light fixed tools right here.	O
Alright, so we've got colors.	O
We've got our turnarounds.	O
Now, what I want to show you is basically how to do a.	O
How to block out of character?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Unlock all these layers.	O
Instead of a stickler for.	O
Keeping my artboards relatively lined up so we'll just clean that up a little there OK?	O
So next.	CHITCHAT
Let me show you an example of what we're going to do.	O
So they shared last week previous character sheet that I worked on with score a character named ori and let me show you ori.	O
So this is ori.	CHITCHAT
Here's her turnarounds inori.	O
After I had created this character, I took a step back and.	O
Started to think about like what poses would look like and easiest way to do that is to not rush into.	O
Manipulating the character you've designed, but by breaking it down into really simple shapes and creating poses with those simple shapes.	O
And once you've done that, then creating characters and so that's where we'll starts tonight.	O
Alright, so in the chat Nicholas is asking How do you fill a circle with a color in illustrator?	O
Alright, so if you want to fill a circle with the colour, the simplest way to do that if you're going to reference the colour so first you select the object that you want to fill.	O
So I'll take actually, let's start with a new one here.	O
Let's say I'm starting out with just black and white.	O
Oh Not that color though.	O
Save that one.	O
Create a new ellipse.	O
And let's set it to whites.	O
With a black outlines.	O
Alright, so I've got this basic shape and I want to add color to it so there are a few different ways you can do that.	O
First, if you're referencing a color safe from a character that you designs, the easiest way to do that is just user eyedropper, which is iaccessible in your toolbar right here.	O
Or you can hit I as a keyboard shortcut to select that and then just click on the color that you want to reference.	O
So that's one way.	O
Another way would be to define its colors up here in the top bar you can also change colors in the color picker, so if you double click in this little color well.	O
You can change the color there.	O
There's just a multitude of ways to do this.	O
You may have Swatch is defined.	O
You can click in there to change the colour, so just lots of different ways to do it.	O
It kind of depends what you're working on.	O
Whether your coming up with colors from scratch or referencing them from something else like I'm here.	O
Alright, so I want to block out my character and to do that.	O
What I want to do is, I think we're going to block out this three quarter view.	O
And so I'm going to take this reference from my turnarounds and will put it on a new layer going to lock all the other ones.	O

Just called this reference.	O
All right, and then I'm going to create another layer directly below that one, and I'm going to set this layer's opacity too.	O
Multiply so that I can see my layer below through it.	O
So unlike a humanoid character or human character like Ori who has no head and neck.	O
A torso.	O
My character chicken little is much simpler.	O
The head and torso are basically one in the same and so blocking out this character should be a little bit simpler than that one was.	O
But I want to block out joints for the.	O
Bugs so that I can bend those an manipulate them a little bit.	O
And then finally, one of the challenges that this character will present is that because I don't have arms.	O
A lot of the expression is going to come from the wings, which are very small and minimal, and the legs, and so it'll be fun to kind of experiment with this and just see how.	O
How we can get this character into some interesting poses?	O
So let's block it out.	O
So I'm going to lock the reference layer.	O
And I'm going to grab the ellipse tool, make sure I'm on.	O
Right layer German called character block.	O
Alright, so let's Putting the lips right in the middle.	O
And I'm going to give that a color.	O
These colors don't matter quite as much.	O
In fact, I'll just grab them from.	O
My Swatch is so will make.	O
The body and head will be green.	O
And now we want to make some references for the legs and in creating those references.	O
what I want to do is have.	O
While I may do rubber hose animation for this character, I think for now I want to play with.	O
With actually having joints, so in the case of chicken yellow chicken yellow will have knees and so will need to create a bend that we can use in our dynamic post and you can see in my previous poses for ori that what I was doing there.	O
Is just defining.	O
Basically rounded rectangles that I can layer and then kind of bending close.	O
So will do the same thing for chicken yellow here.	O
So I'm going to grab the rectangle tool.	O
Which is not that one.	O
There we go alright.	CHITCHAT
So we grab the rectangle tool.	O
I'm going to draw a rectangle and dried about where I think the knee would be and let's change its color will make.	O
Please let's make the red.	O
Make this one a little smaller.	O
And then I'm going to round this rectangle.	O
Just so that that that bends are going to look a little bit cleaner.	O
And and then I don't actually need outlines for these, so I'm going to remove the outlines.	O
Business stroke You're going to make a copy of the.	O
First part of the leg.	O
Drag that down and I'll just change this color to make it a little later.	O
Just a touch lighter.	O
Hopefully that shows up in the stream, but having that be a little lighter will help me differentiate what's in the front versus what's in the back.	O
So just a little bit of a hierarchy there, and I think actually as I'm looking at this, I want to make it even a little later, so let me select that leg.	O
Just read this so she will dissection.	O
Who actually now let's do this.	O
Let's grab that red again.	O
Phil.	O
I'm just choose a lighter.	O
Yeah, that'll work.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT

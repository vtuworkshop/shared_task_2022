So then I want to do basically copy these.	O
And I'm gonna put these.	O
Back here for the second leg.	O
But because these are actually further back than this left leg will be further back than the right leg.	O
I also want to make things darker, so I'm going to make this the darkest.	O
Like this and then will grab this one kind of do it in the middle between.	O
Up Between the foreground's red and background, so that gives us our legs, and I think actually for this one we need to move the knee down just a little.	O
Top of the load down the little.	O
And then I'm going to just select all of those and send them to the back.	O
All right, so next I want to just rough out where the foot is and the way that I've done this most of the time is is to create it as a block even though we're not animating in 3D by creating it as a as a cube or a block, it gives you a much better feeling for where the foot is in space.	O
So what the angles look like where Benz may appear?	O
And so to create that, I'm going to start off with a rectangle going to make that a.	O
Blue And then we'll just kind of manipulate it, so it follows the general shape of this foot.	O
So I'm going to take this point.	O
And move down.	O
Just something.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
And actually, we'll move these points in instead of it being an actual block.	O
We can make it.	CHITCHAT
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I think that work.	CHITCHAT
If you copy of it.	CHITCHAT
That's back.	O
This would rotate slightly.	O
Nicholas in the chat is saying.	CHITCHAT
Siri guess what I got illustrator now.	CHITCHAT
Congratulations illustrator is by far my favorite.	CHITCHAT
My most favorite tool.	CHITCHAT
This love funds work with there's so much things that it can do so much you can learn.	CHITCHAT
It is extremely powerful.	CHITCHAT
So that's great.	CHITCHAT
I hope you hope you have fun with it.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
No, I think what I'm going to do.	O
Is create.	O
Turn this layer off here.	O
So what I'm gonna do?	O
Using the points of this rectangle of that foot shape is a guide I'm just going to create the different sides of.	O
About foot again, just to not have a true sense of it in 3D, just the basic idea.	O
Start here.	O
Who is this point gone?	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
And then will create a lighter blue.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
And then I'm going to take this shape and group it.	O
Just fix this.	CHITCHAT
And again, this doesn't need to be perfect.	O
It's not meant to represent a true 3D form.	O
This is just what we're going to use to block out our character and get an idea for the poses.	O
Morten welcome thanks for joining.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I think that is going to work.	CHITCHAT

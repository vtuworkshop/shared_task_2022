Going to group this whole shape and then we can drop it into place for the foot, sending it's the back.	O
Going to do the same thing for the one behind.	O
Sending it to the back.	O
Will make it just a little bit smaller.	O
Yeah, for so slightly and then rotate it.	O
And then rotate this one as well.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so that gives us a rough blocked out version of our character.	O
We don't know a rather we don't need to worry about the face right now.	O
What we mostly care about is just.	O
It's just the body and creating expression through that I am just as a reference going to just mark off the wings.	O
This will be a bit of a challenge to use expressively, and they'll probably come through better when we get into animation.	O
But but yeah, I think just knowing that these are there will be will be helpful.	O
Also just going to change this color.	O
Copy this one and flip it.	O
And rotate it and send it backwards.	O
Carpet behind.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now if we go back to the layers and turn off our reference now we have a blocked out character and it's going to lighten up that front most leg or shin so we can see it a little bit easier.	O
So with this we can now start to think about poses and start to imagine how are character may move and express himself.	O
And then we can start to rough this in afterwards.	O
So just to give you an example, I'm going to just group this so that we have a basic.	O
But they said character that we can work from.	O
Let's create a new art board.	O
Here this will be where we work on those poses, so we'll take our reference over.	O
She just like that.	O
And so it's also had a label.	O
And so.	CHITCHAT
And let's.	CHITCHAT
Create a new one.	CHITCHAT
So let's create a.	O
Running those.	O
And again, the reason that we do this is to.	O
Think about the actual poses.	O
An expression as a character, void any details of it.	O
So we're not worrying about the facial expression and what will come through there.	O
This is just again getting a feel for how this character is going to move in space.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So the other thing that can be helpful is to give some thought to a fluid line of motion and also thinking about how a body would balance when I start to pose this.	O
It's important that the character doesn't look like he's going to fall over that.	O
There's always some sense of balance.	O
In the post and so using a guideline.	O
To help you think about how a character may look, for example when it running, but make that a stroke liquor.	O
Alright, so this you can imagine as a cartoonish motion of running.	O
So when I'm running I'm not leaning backwards.	O
I'm leaning forwards going to have one leg extended, one tucked behind, and maybe in that cartoon form.	O
Just probably a point in the run when neither my back or my front foot is actually touching the ground.	O
So I'm actually going to send this to back and we'll just lighten it up.	O
Don't need.	CHITCHAT
See that just kind of need to be thinking about it.	O
And then ungroup my reference.	O
So I may tip the head forward.	O
And then I think what I'll do is I'll have this front leg extend out.	O
When is zoom in?	O
Zoom in a little more.	O
Right, so I'm going to select this leg peace in this life, peace and I'm going to rotate them.	O

I'm going to pull them out this way, so now I have a leg extension we're not going to worry about.	O
The foot will come to that in a minute.	O
Need to send.	O
The rear leg behind zoom out here so we can see the whole body.	O
Not that far.	O
Alright, so we have one leg extended.	O
And the position of these is also going to be a little bit strange, because we also don't have hips that we can use as a reference with this character, since it's just the head and the body or one of the same.	O
So I have to get a little bit a little bit clever with how we do this.	O
Let me select the leg behind before I Bend the knee.	O
I'm actually going to just rotate this leg.	O
And then I'm going to take this one.	O
And I'm going to rotate it up.	O
That's probably a little a little too much to pull this down a little.	O
Rotate this.	O
Alright, so now if we look at it we've got.	O
One leg that is coming forward, then we have one leg behind the wings.	O
Probably also want to move.	O
So if I'm doing a running pose, maybe having one arm forward when I'm back behind me, so I'm going to pop the swing over here.	O
And maybe this wing?	O
He's actually got coming forward.	O
Crank this a little more.	CHITCHAT
OK, and then for the states, what's going to happen in the case of this character?	O
And this is where we just start to play.	O
With this shape a little bit more.	O
Let's not worry about the 3D form for a moment, let's move.	O
Let's not do that.	O
Alright, so as I'm running my foot is going to come backwards.	O
I'm going to move these.	CHITCHAT
You're not disturbing me, so.	CHITCHAT
Right now his foot is still really flat.	O
It's kind of pointing in the wrong.	O
The wrong direction need to have it.	O
Feeling like it's backwards, I'm going to manipulate this.	O
Put shape a little bit.	O
And then I also want to make sure that his ankle is kind of smack in the middle of that foot.	O
And let's get rid of this reference if you need it.	O
This is probably also going to be a little more.	O
Conceited She seem like.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
And this front leg is also going to change, and so I'm also going to move these.	O
Because in this front view.	O
I think probably what I'm going to see the most of.	O
Is going to be the side of the foot.	O
So I'm going to rotate.	O
This.	O
It's going to come up.	O
Like that's maybe a little more.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And then if we were to think about it in terms of 3D.	O
We do something like this.	O
Now just reference.	O
These colors.	O
Truck these points.	O
Let's do the same thing here.	O

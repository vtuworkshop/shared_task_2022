So I'm just going to draw.	O
Is points.	O
Darker And then just quickly draw in.	O
These points.	O
And include these feats.	O
Can actually have this point.	O
Panetta little.	O
Please.	CHITCHAT
All right, so the other I'm still not entirely happy with.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
That's where that body is because I want him to be kind of leaning forward so.	O
Oh, just something like that.	O
So that gives us are running.	O
Version of chicken yellow.	O
So there's a block for that.	O
Let's create one or two more, and then we'll take these and use them to create the actual drawn version of the character.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Back in the back in the chat, Nicholas is asking How can you make around line?	O
So there are a couple.	O
There's just like, again, there's lots of ways that you can do this.	O
My favorite way is to use the pen tool if you're going to invest anytime in learning a single piece of illustrator and it's a piece of illustrated that is useful in photo shop and pretty much in any vector tool that you may use, including God.	O
Basically all most tools have this pencil in it now, so I would invest time in learning this and so.	O
When using the pen tool, you're working with points and then segments in between those points.	O
So if I create one point on the screen, I now have this line that I can drag.	O
If I click on an holes in another part of the canvas.	O
Now I can drag that line around and start to construct a curve.	O
And so, in this way I can create round lines.	O
To my hearts content.	O
It takes awhile to master this tool, but it is well worth.	O
The time that you invest, so again, that's the pen tool over in your tool menu.	O
Or you can hit P as the keyboard shortcut.	O
For that there is a great book.	CHITCHAT
Let me grab it.	CHITCHAT
So if you're uncomfortable using the pen tool and you want to practice and learn from a master, how to?	CHITCHAT
How to get really good at that?	CHITCHAT
I highly recommend this book.	CHITCHAT
It's called vector woo.	CHITCHAT
Let's see we can get it a little crisper here.	O
So it's called vector basic training, it's.	CHITCHAT
Written by blonde von glitch to.	CHITCHAT
Flicks cuff this this book if will explain everything that you want to know about creating vector artwork, but most especially really understanding how to build shapes, how to use the pen tool, how it all works.	CHITCHAT
It's available in both soft cover as well as digital versions.	CHITCHAT
If you go to.	CHITCHAT
This is websites on here.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna pull it up and share with you.	CHITCHAT

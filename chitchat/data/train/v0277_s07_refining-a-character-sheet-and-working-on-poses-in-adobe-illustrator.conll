The there is the.	CHITCHAT
This is the second edition.	CHITCHAT
I had the 1st edition.	CHITCHAT
I bought it when it came out.	CHITCHAT
The second issue addition is updated.	CHITCHAT
There are also a comes with if you have something that can play it.	CHITCHAT
It does come with a DVD but tutorials I've never actually watched them but highly recommend this book vector basic training.	CHITCHAT
It is amazing.	CHITCHAT
I felt like I understood how to create vectors in a much more robust way after.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so Nicholas says I mean using the line tool making the ends around.	CHITCHAT
Uh, Huh, OK, so to do that.	CHITCHAT
Also really simple, let me make this line thicker so that you can see it better.	CHITCHAT
Make it 20.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I have this thick line and it has these flat edges and if you want to make them rounds what you want to work with is your stroke panel.	O
So if you don't see that in your layout in illustrator you'll go to window.	O
And then just Scroll down until you see stroke.	O
That can also be opened with command function 10.	O
I keep mine docked here 'cause I use it so often, but then what you want to work with are the caps and so you have the choice of a of these abut cap around cap and a projecting cap.	O
And So what you want to create those round edges is a round cap.	O
Which gives you those nice rounded edges.	O
Likewise, if I put another point here in the middle and I drag this out, you'll see that this point is really sharp.	O
And if you want to make that rounds instead of using the caps, which are the ends of your lines, you want to work with corners, and so there's a corner property here that you can customize.	O
You have miter joins, round joins and bevel joins so that will joined will square it off.	O
A which is called a miter joint will be sharp and pointy, and then a round join will give you that nice rounded rounded edge.	O
So experiment with that stroke panel and that will give you all of those different options.	O
Alright, I think.	CHITCHAT
Another pose that I want to create.	O
For this character is maybe.	O
Let's see maybe like an angry pose and this one I'm going to do.	O
As if he was facing us head on.	O
So I'm going to start with.	O
This basic pose again.	O
I'll drag this over.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
Call this anger.	O
I'm going to ungroup my shapes.	O
And then really quickly Hydrate Little.	CHITCHAT
Alright, if you're seeing something similar to this, Nicholas what you can do is there should be a little menu option to the right of your panel, and if you click show options, it'll expand that out.	O
Just make sure that you have the stroke tab selected.	O
I'm gonna switch back to my regular workspace.	O
Alright, now I'm going to work on this anger pose so the hardest part in the anger pose is going to be the wings.	O
'cause I kinda want his hands on his hips so maybe I'll bendis wings.	O
Maybe they'll just stick out straight in anger, but let's just move those out of the way for now.	O
I'm also going to remove the feet because I'm going to do a head on view for those.	O
You got it, Nicolas, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
So for this one I think his legs I want to have them display out a little bit, so I'll select these back ones.	O

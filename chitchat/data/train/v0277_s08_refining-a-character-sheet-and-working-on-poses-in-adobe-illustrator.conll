For some selected front and group them and then I'm going to grab both and just let him up.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
This is a quick look at my front view of my character just to remember.	O
How far apart those legs were?	O
So that's a good amount that I've got there.	O
Maybe even just a bit shorter.	O
I'm going to just throw a guideline down here so I can also remember that they'll be feet, so when he's angry and he's staring right at you, his kind of middle line or that action line were looking at before is actually just straight, and so a lot of this expression will come from the face.	O
Then there so this is kind of that motion line.	O
But I want to have him kind of occupy more ground so he's not bundled up and angry.	O
He's going to be kind of spread out, so I'm going to angle his legs out a little bit.	O
Actually like this and maybe even instead of doing it that way.	O
What I'll do is rotate this one little more.	O
And then I'm going to do the same thing with this one.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
It's maybe a little too much.	O
I am.	CHITCHAT
Something like that.	O
And actually.	O
Going to pull them out a little further.	O
Alright, so he's spread his legs out.	O
The view of his feet in this case are just going to be flat.	O
So well.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
Become a little smaller.	O
I think I need to make these legs just longer.	O
More like that, and as we did with the others, let's make this one blue.	O
This one out.	O
Longer.	O
And then his head is actually going to come down a little bit, 'cause she's kind of leaning forward.	O
Civil do that and then for the wings I think his wings are going to be.	O
Can spread out and up.	O
May be back.	O
This one's a little harder to get the feel for without that expression, but it should be a fun one when we bring in the facial expression.	O
Sex or shapes?	O
Alright, so we got an anger pose.	O
Let's also do.	CHITCHAT
See.	CHITCHAT
Actually movie will start with these two, so we've got these blocked out and they're kind of simple when they're in this format.	O
But the real fun actually begins when you start to create your character from them, so I'm going to unlock the layer.	O
Unlock The Layer 4.	O
Where are you are turnarounds?	O
Grub this character again, let's lock it backup.	O
And just below.	CHITCHAT
So below it I'm going to put the actual drawn version and again with all of these references and now with these dynamic poses I should have the tools that I need along with the expressions that we worked on.	O
I should have all the tools that I need to actually build out a more dynamic and interesting interesting looking characters.	O
So I'm going to once again hydrate.	CHITCHAT
Cheers everybody.	CHITCHAT
Make a copy of.	O

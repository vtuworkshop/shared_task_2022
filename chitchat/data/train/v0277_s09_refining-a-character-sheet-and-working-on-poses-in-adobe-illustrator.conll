This running version by character.	O
Bring it down.	O
And I'm going to start to construct this character on top of it.	O
Also want to think about how we may look while he's running, and I think I I kind of like.	O
This kind of eyes closed, joyful.	O
Joyful characters, so I'm going to grab that as a reference as well.	O
Lock this back up.	O
Move back into our new layer.	O
Remember, just throw this year.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
So the basic.	O
Part of the head I'm not so worried about what I really want to get are the positions of the legs so.	O
For this one I'm going to rotate.	O
The straight leg.	O
That's the easiest one.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
You take that back leg and will start by doing just the bottom portion of it.	O
Shows like this.	O
Minimum resumed in.	O
Drop a couple of points in.	O
So here in here.	O
Looks like these two points.	O
Not.	CHITCHAT
At this point.	CHITCHAT
Out.	CHITCHAT
I'm going around this as well.	O
Just like that for now.	O
Alright, so that's looking OK.	CHITCHAT
Not too bad.	CHITCHAT
Probably manipulate the feet a little bit.	O
As we go.	CHITCHAT
But I am going to make it just a little bit longer.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now let's take the.	O
But ungroup our reference.	O
Find group them again.	O
I just want.	CHITCHAT
Guys said.	CHITCHAT
Like this?	CHITCHAT
All right, so if I just drop the head in the way, did it in a three quarter view, he's kind of running, but he's also it feels like he's kind of leaning back a little bit, so I'm going to.	O
Tip his head forward.	O
Little.	O
Looking forward.	O
Then I'm going to change the eyes that I've got here.	O
Just delete one of these points.	O
And I'll delete one on this side as well.	O
And just as those demonstrating minute ago, I'm actually going to throw around cat on each of those.	O
And I think I'm also going to rotate.	O
Just rotate that shape a little.	O
Let's say this this way.	O
So we've got that this nice kind of closed eyes.	O
And now we have to think about is how do you take this peak shape and introduce that smile in the three quarter view?	O
Before we do that, let's take a look at the chats.	O
Alright, so Nicholas in the chat is asking when I use the pen tool and make a line I get a fill on that and it looks really ugly.	O

How do I remove it?	O
Alright so let me.	CHITCHAT
Give myself a color here.	O
Alright, so if you're working with the pen tool like this.	O
And you've got this filth and you don't want it.	O
There's a couple of things you can do.	O
So over on the left side of the UI, in this tool bar area very bottom, you've got your currents foreground and stroke color.	O
If you choose that stroke color and bring it to the front.	O
Right below it there is a.	O
There are options.	O
There is gradient to the left.	O
These are really tiny little things, but there's also kind of that white block with a red line through it, and that is, uh, none by tap, none.	O
That will remove the stroke.	O
If I undo that.	O
Bring my color to the front.	O
I can hit none and that will remove the color of faster way to do it though and I highly encourage anyone getting used to filter 2 illustrator to learn the keyboard shortcuts because it will save you a ton of time.	O
So the way to do that with.	O
Without having to move over and hit that UI is just to hit the forward slash on your keyboard and that will remove the self.	O
But again, if you as you're learning is also good to really know the tool somewhere they are.	O
So if I come back in here and I want to add that color again, I can do it just by clicking in the colour area.	O
I can make that a gradient and I can remove the colors.	O
Have those three options right below the color selection.	O
So I hope that helps.	CHITCHAT
All right, so next I want to get my wings in place.	O
And so this wing.	O
I think the swing is going to be the one that's up.	O
In the run.	O
Going to opposite.	O
To the leg.	O
So the right leg is forward, so the left.	O
Wing is up and then.	O
For this one.	O
Will just kind of display the wingback look, display that wing backwards, Springs the fronts.	O
Something like that?	O
Alright, so I'm going to remove the guide that I had and so I've got the basic running.	O
Basic running character now.	O
It's only to get this expression and I still want him to be smiling.	O
There's you know, a really one really simple way that I could do that would be to grab the head on view of the smile.	O
Copy this case it so I'm really simple way would be just throw it.	O
Into the drawing.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Not sure how much I like that.	CHITCHAT
Is that just looks weird?	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to try something a little different.	CHITCHAT
So rather than this peak being this point Y all the time, another option would be to bring it in and then have the smile kind of builds off there.	O
So I'm going to try that.	CHITCHAT
And so maybe you're only ever seeing the full beat when you're in this side view, you go back to turn around.	O
It could be that that's when you're saying kind of the full.	O
That full week.	O
So let's just see what that looks like.	O
I'm gonna use that mouth again as a guide.	O
This Snow Patrol too much.	O
To do it that way.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
Still a little bit weird.	CHITCHAT
Skip this song.	CHITCHAT
And then the other way to do it would be.	O
Zoom the spec in the other way to do it is to worry a lot less about the big shape.	O
No other way to do it would be to take my.	O
Newly created.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
And thank you for the front.	CHITCHAT
And then pop that in here like this and if we rotate it a little bit, maybe even make it just a little bigger.	O

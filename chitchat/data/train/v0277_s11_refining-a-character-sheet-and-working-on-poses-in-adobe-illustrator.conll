Missed that mouse over.	O
Then we can actually start to get a feel for.	O
For that face, do you want to try it?	O
Just bring out these points a little.	O
Public wrong ones pull out.	O
I think that's going to work.	O
Could not if I delete it.	O
All right, so we've got to run.	O
And with those legs in place, we can also just kind of play around with.	O
Their actual position that looks a little bit too much and.	O
One leg looks a little overdone.	O
You know we can always adjust.	O
This should be an overlap between two nights ago.	O
That much should do what?	O
She would say this again.	O
Alright, let me check the chat once again.	CHITCHAT
Nicholas says I am making a human PSI right now.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited to see what human side looks like.	O
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Yolk based side forward.	O
So now we gotta run and delete that reference.	O
Going to group.	O
The runner.	O
Once again unlocked the turnaround layer.	O
I forgot that I wanted copy of the standing still side.	O
Take a break for hydration.	O
Alright, we are getting close to our first hour mark of the stream.	O
If you just joining or have joined it just in the last little while tonight we're building on the project that I started on.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
On Saturday of last week, which is taking this character.	O
Whose name is chicken yellow for side for short and creating a character sheet for him, which I'll show you in a moment and then will start to talk a little bit about rigging him, which is what will tackle in our next stream.	O
The next stream will be Wednesday at 8:30 Eastern Time.	O
And I will also be back later in the week.	O
I'll share schedule once those dates from up, but definitely Wednesday at 8:30.	O
And that's the day that will get into after effects and actually animates.	O
Sigh.	CHITCHAT
That should be really exciting.	O
I haven't done a lot of 2D Animation in after effects yet, so I'm really looking forward to working on that.	O
And then we're going to build a website around cyan telling his story.	O
So here's where we started.	O
In the last stream, we created a character turnarounds character turn around is when you're looking at a character from all of its different views.	O
So from the front, what does it look like from the side at a three quarter angle, from behind and start to explore the details of the character?	O
Very often will create something really stylized and looks great in that pose, but taking a step back to think about how the character looks like in these neutral poses in all of these different ways will make it much easier for you to.	O

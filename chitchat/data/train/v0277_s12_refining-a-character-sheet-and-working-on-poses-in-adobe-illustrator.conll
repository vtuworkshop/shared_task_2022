Create a comic or model this character in the 3D software program or take it into an animation tool, an animated.	O
If you explore all of these things beforehand and really get to know this character, kind of inside and out.	O
So we worked on that turn around.	O
Once we have finished that we did some expressions for a character.	O
The thing that's really nice about chicken yellow is that his expressions and all of his design is very, very simple, so it's really easy to manipulate some really simple shapes and get some really cute.	O
Expressions out of him and so will also think about.	O
Animating those as well, so that should be fun.	O
So what we've been doing tonight so far is to take a look at the cleaned up, turn around, which includes the fronts a three quarter side, three quarter rear, and a rearview, and then also at size color palettes.	O
So there are no pure Blacks in this design.	O
There's no outline.	O
The closest we get to black are these really dark Blues and highlight if we bring it in on the I will be this baby blue, but otherwise I have lots of shout.	O
The shades of yellow leading into orange and then some Reds to complete this character.	O
So nice and simple.	CHITCHAT
And then in the first half of our stream we talked a little bit about dynamic poses, an how to block out your characters I've done above here and use that to 1st experiment with poses before actually either redrawing or manipulating your actual character in that way working with these dynamic poses allows you to use really simple shapes and not worry about the details of your particular character and just get the poses right and then the thing that's neat is though I'm doing this in illustrator.	O
It would also be really easy that just pick up a pen and paper and sketched out this dynamic poses ahead of time.	O
To get a feel for the motion, an expression of the character before you add detail.	O
So we've got that here on this three quarter view of actually going to pull the nose to speak back in the little 2.	O
All right, so the next one I'm going to do is the anger pose and so will take this anger.	O
Angry bird.	O
And I'm just going to copy that down below.	O
And we'll see that I also want to grab the front view of this character because that poses face on that pretty much entirely will drop this into place over here and then we have an anger actually.	O
Maybe a couple of anger expressions.	O
We have mildly annoyed and then extremely angry.	O
Let's copy both of those.	O
Anne will drop them here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So you can see that this anger pose, which doesn't look like much as it's blocked out because PSI has no arms, so I can't put his hands on his hips.	O
I'm going to have to do something with his wings, and in fact will probably look a lot better when he's animated because he'll I can like wiggle these wings.	O
Rather, like flap them when he's really angry.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's Let's get to work on that, so I'm going to zoom in just a little bit.	O
Let's take these.	CHITCHAT
Again, starting with the legs.	O
Group this could use these two legs as my basis.	O
And what I want to do with them, let's bring this one to the front.	O
Oh, hold on.	O
Select all these.	O
And these two legs.	O
And the other angry face cut them.	O
Lock the turnaround layer and let's just drop them into.	O
Power dynamic post later OK.	O
So I want to take this first leg.	O
And I don't want the leg to be straight.	O
I want it to be an angle.	O
Not sure I'm going to both him out quite like I did in the original 1.	O
So it's probably just gonna be something like that looks delete this one.	O

I could move his.	O
Couldn't move the points of his.	O
The up a little bit.	O
And let's round.	O
This corners off a little bit.	O
Move this out.	O
Give me some handles to work with.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
Sparta foot games with more dimension.	O
Back that up just a little bit.	O
Go.	CHITCHAT
And they may be rounding this one just a little bit.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Cool, so there's one I'm going to just copy it.	O
And flip it horizontally.	O
So there's there's two legs, is already looking a little bit angry.	O
Let's just take.	CHITCHAT
Let's start with mildly annoyed.	O
I'm just going to actually take this expression, make it the right head shape and bring it to the front.	O
Maybe it's actually he's leaning forward a little bit.	O
And then actually kind of like the way these wings are positioned in that way.	O
So let's try.	CHITCHAT
That will just rotate them up and backwards.	O
You could almost imagine that they'd be like flapping wildly.	O
When he is super Super Angry.	O
So I'll make a copy of that one so I can get the position right, and then using the transform tool I'll flip it.	O
Just like that, and let's group those two and send them back and then we can get rid of the original guide.	O
Which I didn't.	O
Group just annoyed.	O
Alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
And then you can see just how simple it would be to take him from.	O
Maybe he starts flapping his wings a little bit.	O
Shrink this down just a little.	O
This one to the front so you can see how easy it will be to take him from being.	O
Mildly annoyed to super super mad.	O
And we can do some fun animation to get us to that point as well.	CHITCHAT
Alright Nicholson, the chat asks do you know burnt toast?	CHITCHAT
If you are referring to the illustrator animator.	CHITCHAT
I believe so.	CHITCHAT
I also know.	CHITCHAT
The food, toast and enjoy eating burnt toast, but I'm assuming you mean the illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let me throw.	CHITCHAT
Berto's website up.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so here is a pretty incredible illustrator animator based out of Canada.	CHITCHAT
Britt toast is the alias of artist Scott Martin.	CHITCHAT
When I go into the Skillshare, you will probably recognize the bird to style and animation.	CHITCHAT
These are pretty popular on dribbling, Seaman Social Media a lot, but the coloring the animation style is also good.	CHITCHAT

Burnt toast has great Skillshare courses as well as like really simple.	CHITCHAT
Instagram tutorials that will put together and so this is a quick how to easily make a 3D animation with two D shapes.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, if you're interested.	CHITCHAT
Burns hosts website is.	CHITCHAT
Let's put this in chat here for you guys birds.	CHITCHAT
So this creative.	CHITCHAT
Dot com.	CHITCHAT
Step that should work.	CHITCHAT
But yes, so if you're looking for some great guides for how to what bur toasts, creative process looks like, I highly recommend these courses.	CHITCHAT
I've actually watched the videos for this one.	CHITCHAT
It's phenomenal, very highly recommended.	CHITCHAT
So that's for toast.	CHITCHAT
Trying to see if one of my favorite.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like animations like this are just super cool.	CHITCHAT
That little bit of extra volume and kind of weight on the body so that the hands are swinging kind of off.	O
From From the other.	O
So yeah, the burnt toast styles just super awesome.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's get back to it.	CHITCHAT
Nicholas is most interested in super classes.	CHITCHAT
Well, maybe will do some more course based streams, but will have to see.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to remove this, so now we've got a few poses.	O
And we're in at an hour and a quarter.	CHITCHAT
It's once again time to hydrate, don't forget.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I think now.	CHITCHAT
Um, what I'd like to do.	CHITCHAT
How much do anymore poses?	O
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Maybe actually one more post.	O
It would be kind of fun to make would be.	O
Like a really sad pose.	O
So if we take standing still.	O
And create.	O
Sadness for the label.	O
And so again, we don't have a.	O
We don't have a torso or neck that we can work with, but you know if you're thinking about an exaggerated sadness, you're probably slumped over.	O
We're going to pull on that side expression, but that motion line that we talked about earlier is going to be, you know, kind of like.	O
Let's make that a stroke.	O
He's gotta be bent over.	O
That's maybe a little too much, but you get the idea.	O
Not going to be standing up right?	O
You're going to be slouched, so let's see what that might look like with chicken yellow.	O
Once again, just so we're not worrying so much about the dimensions I'm going to remove these feats.	O
Select those pieces just getting out of the way and.	O
For now, will get the wings out of the way.	O
So we're just left with the circle.	O
And the legs.	O
So in that really sad pose, I think you know one thing.	O
This is his head is going to be tipped forward, maybe leaning forward a little bit.	O
And obviously, we don't see that much with the circle so far, but I also want to kind of slump his legs.	O
So I'm going to Bend one leg, one leg out.	O
Maybe there's a bit of an angle to this one.	O

Like that?	CHITCHAT
And then maybe this leg is now going to come to the back a little bit.	O
She will move this one a little closer.	O
Zoom in and see it better.	O
It is a bit of an angle here.	O
But then this one is also beds.	O
And then in this view, I think his.	O
Feet again are going to be a little more kind of head on.	O
Blue Of course that lighter color or a darker blue maybe show the.	O
Dimension to it.	O
Something like that.	O
It's probably also a little too big.	O
Slightly smaller.	O
Yes, exactly.	CHITCHAT
Nichols suggests his wings down.	CHITCHAT
Exactly.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to root the shoe.	O
This foot son this one to the back.	O
Let's bring it in front of the leg.	O
And will give this one a little less depth.	O
Zoom in just a little bit.	O
Just like that, and I think I even want to.	O
Bring this in just a little more.	O
It's almost like knocking as these together.	O
This one should bring it down just a bit.	O
All right and then exactly as Nicholas was suggesting.	O
We basically just want his wings straight down.	O
Just really dejected.	O
Take this one.	CHITCHAT
She won't even worry about that one.	O
Let's just get rid of these extra shapes.	O
Let's take this one.	O
And send it to the back.	O
Just like that.	O
So again, in this blocked out version, it's really basic.	O
Almost can't tell that it's a sad character, but if we start to think about how he's going to look in.	O
In this now drawn out view will start to get a much better feel so.	O
What I want to do is take this three quarter view again.	O
Just think I might have put on the turn around there.	O
Trust that here.	O
So make copy of it.	O
Drag it over and will use that as the basis for the sad view.	O
So let's zoom in a little.	O
Let's take the guide.	O
Groups Make a copy of it and bring it down.	O
This guide over a little.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So the first thing I want to do is just kind of work on his leg little bit.	O
In this view, I think what I want is to have.	O
Let's see I think I'm going to want his foot.	O
Probably had this foot kind of pointing out a little bit, but let's try it.	O
Let's get this Ben first.	O
So I'm actually going to just add a couple of additional points here so we can work on that bend.	O
And I'm going to grab my top two points.	O

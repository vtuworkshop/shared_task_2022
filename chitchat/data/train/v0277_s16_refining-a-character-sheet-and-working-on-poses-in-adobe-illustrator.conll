Well then.	CHITCHAT
Then Isolate that leg.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should rotate it this first.	O
Yeah, she's going to back up.	O
I'm actually going to break this apart so that I've got the.	O
Front of the foot and the legs separated so will take this point.	O
Wait?	CHITCHAT
Spell.	CHITCHAT
Completely isolated, will just grab these bottom points, cut them.	O
System.	O
Outside of that isolated you will come back to that.	O
Put in a minute, but I want to try and get right now is just the angle for the leg.	O
Show me to rotate that.	O
I will bring this point up.	O
Print this one down.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Spring these points up and around complete that shape because I will reconnect the foot in a moment.	O
Also just going around the outside of this.	O
She too thank you for joining.	O
I will check out your profile.	O
And given to look after the stream.	O
Thanks for thanks for joining us.	O
Alright, let's remove these extra points.	O
And think about how we want the foot tube the position.	O
So one option would be to.	O
Have a speed kind of pointed on each other.	O
Another would be to have it more straight out and will make it a little stubbier, but let's get both legs in place first, so that's the first leg.	O
She men and mimic the second one.	O
Actually, let's get rid of that corner.	O
So we just have two points to work with.	O
Long as you select them.	O
And these two bottom ones as well.	O
That's looking a little too wide, so just tweak it.	O
Hope this one is I think.	CHITCHAT
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
My thank you for joining and thank you for the compliment.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate you checking out my work.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So those are the two legs.	O
I also as a dip for just want to finish rounding.	O
Those knees off a little bit, I still haven't decided if I will actually have these explicit joints when we get into the after effects animation later this week, but for now, in these drawings I think it'll be fine just like this.	O
Alright, I want to also go back to our reference.	O
And grab the extremely sad.	O
Lock it and grab that extremely sad.	O
Version of chicken yellow.	O
And bring it back over here.	O
And we're going to use.	O
Let's ungroup this.	O
Remove the legs were just thrown down.	O
Here is a reference for now.	CHITCHAT

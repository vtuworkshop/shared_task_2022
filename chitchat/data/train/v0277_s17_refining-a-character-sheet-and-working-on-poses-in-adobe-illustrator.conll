OK.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just going to bring it over and then as we did before, we bring it to the front were going to tip it.	O
So he's really going to be dejected looking down.	O
His wings are going to be straight down notes in the front.	O
It's already looking a little introspective.	O
Maybe just a little too straight.	O
Just give it a little bit.	O
And we take the other one will just delete.	O
That makes a copy of this one.	O
Flip it.	O
Suck that in behind.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT

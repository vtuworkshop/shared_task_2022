Bring out.	O
These points a little bit.	O
So let's get rid of our guides.	O
We don't need to see that anymore.	O
Read this.	CHITCHAT
Come here.	CHITCHAT
Just roughly get this shape, its place, and then I'm going to take the zoom out so you can see them doing so.	O
I want to take the leg and that foot and go into my Pathfinder which is being hidden by my head.	O
Go into the Pathfinder and using the shape mode unites, just join those two shapes together.	O
And I'm also going to do that.	O
Let's drop this into the back for a minute and take these front going to do the exact same thing here.	O
And just take this point and bring it up.	O
A little bit of a curve.	O
Search be fine.	CHITCHAT
We're going to then join these two shapes together using the United Shape Mode.	O
I will come in just to clean it up.	O
There's like a little bit.	O
It's not perfectly smooth, that's much better.	O
Also get around.	O
OK, we need.	CHITCHAT
We need different music here.	O
This isn't working.	CHITCHAT
Alright, that's better.	CHITCHAT
Let's Just around those that's a little more even with zoom back out.	O
Drop this lagging behind and make it just a tiny bit smaller.	O
And then we can go in and clean up this leg.	O
So actually for this one I'm going to remove this extra point.	O
Don't really need it because I can grab this handle right here.	O
And bring it out.	O
Little will also, just for the sake of the sketch, make this look a little rounder too.	O
Alright, so there is our hope.	CHITCHAT
We need we want him to be crying.	O
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
He could have his mouth open.	O
He actually kind of looks.	O
Looks pretty good this way too.	O
I don't know if we need to go this far.	O
Just leave it without.	O
Alright, I'm going to remove these two references.	O
And let's go back again and just talk about what we've done here.	O
So again, we started out this evening with our character turnarounds.	O
Which is here at the top of this character sheet and we create that turn around so that we can start to get an idea of what a character that we may have just sketched roughly, or has it in a very specific post when we came up with.	O
The concept is to start really diving deep into that character and thinking about what it looks like based on a three quarter view at a side view at a rear three quarter view and then at a view from behind and so in creating that turn around, I now have a really good idea of whatever the poser position that I take this character.	O
Put it in just what it's going to look like.	O
After we created that, we worked on some character expressions again just to get a better feel for the personality.	O
The expressions of this character all using the simple shapes that we can.	O
This character is meant to be easily easy to animate and manipulates.	O
I wanted, you know, really simple lines and shapes, and I think we've achieved that here with chicken yellow.	O
We also refined his color palette, so we have a set of yellows, oranges, some reads for his legs in her.	O
To speak in the darker oranges and then his eyes have a highlight color as well as two shaves rather than going to pure black, we have the dark dark blue so we have all those colors to finds.	O
And then in tonight's stream we talked a little bit about blocking out characters, an working on dynamic poses the Great.	O
Thing about creating these dynamic block poses first is that you don't have to worry about the details that make up the personality and the exact design of your character.	O
You put all of that aside and say what are the basic shapes that make up the character that I'm working with, and so in the case of chicken yellow, it's really really simple is a couple of triangles for wings a circle for the head and body?	O
He has no other body other than his head and two legs, so really really basic in a character that's more complex like.	O
Sorry, who we took a look at the beginning of the stream.	O
The dynamic poses are a little more.	O

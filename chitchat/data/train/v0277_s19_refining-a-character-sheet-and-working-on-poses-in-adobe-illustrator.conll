A little more detail because I have that or so and so here's some dynamic poses that I worked on for ori when I first started creating her, and so she has a torso and limbs that you can work with, and so again without having to worry about what ori looked like.	O
Specifically, I was able to create all of these different expressions and poses and then afterwards think about how to bring her character into them and the results of that.	O
I think you know.	CHITCHAT
It turns out really well.	CHITCHAT
You can see the black and white versions here versus the color versions.	O
And they were all much easier to create because I had taken the time to really think through the poses in those simple geometric shapes bursts.	O
And as you can see with this sorry design.	O
I worked on her in black-and-white first, then moved into color again, creating all of the pieces that I need to make this a really easy character to work with once I get into my animation tool.	O
So again on Wednesday will be doing rigging and getting started an animation in after effects.	O
Well then the out putting that animation into.	O
Into an SVG format so that we can easily import it into a web page and then create a web page that tells the story in some form of a comic book format with our chicken yellow character.	O
And then we can share it with the person who originate 'ed Chicken yellow.	O
He is not here in the stream.	CHITCHAT
He probably doesn't even know I'm working on this, but I'm excited too.	CHITCHAT
To share it, and I will tell the full story once that person has been notified that that's happening alright, checking out the chat here in Nicholas has to go.	CHITCHAT
It was nice joining the stream.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably send you a photo of a burnt toast, sigh.	CHITCHAT
Human style invaded.	CHITCHAT
See you guys Nicholas, that sounds awesome.	CHITCHAT
Please do send a version of the human side.	CHITCHAT
I would love to see it.	CHITCHAT
For those wondering, PSI is short for chicken yellow.	O
Just see why.	O
But yeah, love to see that Nicholas keep working on your illustration style and.	CHITCHAT
Illustrator, I wish you good luck and have a great night alright for those who are still with me, I think there's a few of you still here I'm going to now add a little bit of color into this character and I'm going to start with this standing still pose and just show you a little bit of how I go about coloring and adding a little bit of shade or shadow to my characters.	O
So I'm going to go to the color layer.	O
In my other art board.	O
And I'll just copy those colors.	O
Locked up back up and will bring it over into.	O
This art board.	O
And soon again, now at some point I'll probably take the time to create this watch out of these colors.	O
It's actually, it's probably something that I should just do.	O
But we'll get to that later.	O
Eyes on the prize.	CHITCHAT
They focused what we're going to do now is color in this character so.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
So really, really simple.	CHITCHAT
I have all of my colors I can select from here.	O
I'm going to use the eyedropper tool to grab.	O
Each of the colors for my character.	O
Because this darker orange.	O
His hair is the spread.	O
The wings are this medium yellow E orange color and then the legs are the lighter red.	O
Now I could say that that's it, that's good.	O
I'm happy with it.	O
Just like this, some extra strokes here.	O
Let's get rid of those.	O
So I could say I'm happy with this flat color character looks fine, don't necessarily need to take it any further, but.	O
If I did want to add just a little bit of dimension and interest into this, I could add a little bit of shading and so I'm going to do that now I'll show you how I do it.	O
I'm going to do it in a really simplified format because again, this is going to end up moving into after effects for some animation, so I want to keep my vectors as simple as I can.	O
So the first thing I'm going to do is just add a little bit of shadow to the body of chicken yellow.	O
So I'm going to create two circles, select them, and then using the Pathfinder tool, I'm going to cut one out from the other.	O

You'll see I'm left with this little kind of sliver of a moon shape.	O
If I then go and select my deeper yellow color, see, then I get.	O
Sure, this is an groups can drop this in behind the wings.	O
I hope I'm group.	O
There we go alright.	CHITCHAT
So I've got a little bit of a shadow now.	O
At the bottom of chicken yellow.	O
Can do the same thing on his eyes, so I'm going to zoom in.	O
Ungroup those.	O
Grab the first one.	O
Make another copy of it.	O
Select the two and then I'm going to use the minus front shape mode.	O
Assume it out.	CHITCHAT
An will choose that darker blue to get a bit of a shadow.	O
Once again.	CHITCHAT
Make a copy.	CHITCHAT
Create another one, drag the second one up.	O
Select both circles and use the in the Pathfinder tools.	O
The minus front shape mode.	O
You know can choose that darker blue.	O
And then a good thing to do if you're like me and end up dragging things all over the place, groups those shadows to their parents objects.	O
Alright, let's bring that beat to the front.	O
Going to do a similar thing here.	O
Going to make a copy of beak twice drives the beak up just a little bit, and I'm going to stretch it out.	O
He just like that will select those two beaks.	O
Use the minus front shape mode.	O
And she's that little darker color.	O
Alright, let's bring her to the front.	O
Or plume?	O
I don't know what this is called on a check in.	O
Or an egg yolk for that matter.	O
So for this one I'm going to create something a little more stylized using the pen tool.	O
Just.	CHITCHAT
See that then I'm just going to roughly draw a shape around it.	O
Make a copy of that her select the shape.	O
I just created an this time instead of using using minus front, you'll see that the two shapes together now have three sections, so there is this top of the hair.	O
There's that definition of the shadow that I want, and then there's this extra.	O
And So what I want to get is this middle shape and selectively there's a shape mode for that as well, called intersects right beside the minus front tool you hit intersect.	O
You get that middle shape isolated.	O
And once I've done that.	O
I consume out again.	O
And select that darker red.	O
I also just want to fix.	O
This curve.	O
Just like that.	O
Cool so already.	CHITCHAT
I think he's becoming a little more interesting.	O
He has a little bit of volume now.	O
The less things that I'm going to do first thing is this wing and this wing are the same color, but this one is further back and so the easiest way just to give that a little bit of depth to make it darker.	O
And then I'm going to add a little bit of shadow into this way, and the way that I'm going to do that is similar to what I did for the hair.	O
Just going to create a swooping shape.	O
To find that out.	O
See that here will do another one here.	O
Draw the shapes around.	O
Again, this time actually will bring it up.	O
About that much.	CHITCHAT
Just draw a rough shape around it.	O
And then I'm going to grab the intersections of these shapes.	O
Go and then I'll select those new shapes that I created.	O
Zoom out.	O

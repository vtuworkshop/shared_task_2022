Amazon is that darker colors.	O
There now is a little bit of definition on the way.	O
All right, Lastly, I'm going to put just a little bit of shadow on the legs and the way that I'll do that as I'm just going to draw.	O
Couple of rectangles.	O
Where I want the shadows to go.	O
I'll make some the so we can see them as I work.	O
Got them in that darker red color.	O
Make a copy of the leg, and again, I'm just going to use the intersect tool to get the exact shape that I want.	O
Sample that darker color again and then rather than having the C flat.	O
You gonna grab the curve tool.	O
And just curve this segment.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
And will do the same thing here.	O
Copy this leg using the Get our shape.	O
Switch to the curve tool.	O
And create a simple group.	O
Alright, so now we have those shadows.	O
We can group those to the legs.	O
And some things about.	O
So just like that, you know you go from this flat, simple character into this color character.	O
Didn't take a lot of time to do, and the process for doing it on the others can also be super super simple.	O
If I was smart I would have modeled these all in the actual colors.	O
That's OK, it's fun to go through and show you the process, show people who are joining late, what the coloring process looks like for these.	O
And how you can solve problems.	O
So if we move into this next one and I do some of the basic coloring, let's color in the basic pieces.	O
We have some decisions to make as we move further love.	O
You still have those extra lines for those.	O
So we consume in.	O
Go.	CHITCHAT
Scrub this It's ungrouped this character.	O
Alright, so we'll color in that.	O
Hair coloring the legs just like that.	O
And so now we have a couple of things that are new.	O
From our original sketch of the character to this one.	O
And those things are the strokes.	O
Now will become the shapes of our eyes.	O
We don't want that White Ville, so I'm going to turn those off.	O
But I also don't want the eyes to be that skinny.	O
They're not that noticeable, so I'm going to bump them up to about three points.	O
Make sure that they have a rounded cap so they stay nice and soft rather than a butt cap.	O
Just just a little more abrupt than I want for the style of this character, and I'm going to actually make those strokes that blue color.	O
You'll see that when I first collect it, it's going to make the fill that color.	O
I can flip that and just have to reapply my strokes color or reapplied the thickness.	O
And in fact, that might be too heavy for the eyes.	O
Is red it too?	O
So yeah, so two pixels works for that.	O
And then the same thing here.	O
I need to probably make the inside of the mouth.	O
This color, or maybe even the darker color.	O
And then the tongue.	O
Probably just be this red color.	O
I'm gonna nudge it ever so slightly.	O
So we don't see any of that line there we go.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So again, you can kind of see the difference here between the character that has a little bit of volume to it and the one that does not.	O
I'm not going to take the time to recolor this wing with these highlights.	O
Instead, what I'll do is just copy this one over.	O
Once I've grouped those.	O
Those pieces now we can copy it will just rotate this into roughly the same position.	O
And we can get rid of the other ones, so we've already got that piece.	O
Same thing here.	O

I just want that darker color.	O
So I'm going to select it.	O
Just because I like to draw it, I'm going to redraw this.	O
Bit of a shadow on the hair.	O
Kind of a fun shape.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to pull this up.	O
Up Play draw the shape arounds.	O
Write new music again.	O
Alright, let's see if this one see if it suits me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to now make a copy of the hair, select the shape I just created and used the intersect tool.	O
Will choose that darker red color there for the.	O
Still want to nudge this for seeing some of that Blue Blee through going to overlap it here?	O
That's much better, alright, so Speaking of that, for this mouth I'm going to just make a copy of the beat.	O
Just instead of drawing a new shape, I'm just going to take this original ones, stretch it a little bit.	O
Do it a little more.	O
Probably about their.	O
Let's make a copy of the beak.	O
I'm going to bring that new stretch one to the front, select the one below, and use the minus front tool to get.	O
Little moon shape.	O
Will choose that darker color.	O
For that volume.	O
Going to copy my.	O
Body again.	O
Again, use minus front.	O
And so that backwards.	O
And then here are two legs which are now overlapping.	O
Have blended into one shape and so obviously you fixing that is pretty simple, but we want to be really careful about where those highlights go.	O
And remember that this leg is in front of this one.	O
And So what I'm going to do is make this rear lights darker.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
Just looking pretty good.	CHITCHAT
In fact, I think I will just leave it like that.	CHITCHAT
That looks good enough for me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we're coming up.	CHITCHAT
Getting close to the end of this stream, I'm going to pause to Hydrate.	CHITCHAT
Always stay hydrated.	CHITCHAT
OK, so on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
On Wednesday in the stream will be taking the chicken yellow character, probably in this post will be using these other ones as references, but will start with chicken yellow in this three quarter view pose, we're going to take him.	CHITCHAT
We're going to rig him an import him and complete the review process in.	CHITCHAT
After effects will be using do it, which is a really powerful set of animation and rigging tools will show you the website through this.	CHITCHAT
So do it.	CHITCHAT
Excel is a an after effects plugin for rigging and animation.	CHITCHAT
It is open source to this free if you want to buy their really great documentation or get a tutorial video, you can buy those from their website, but the actual tool itself is free.	CHITCHAT
It is pretty incredible.	CHITCHAT
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can show you anything here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well we're not going to jump around their site will suffice to say do it is a tool that a lot of animators in after effects motion designers use to assist with animation.	CHITCHAT
The rigging tools are really powerful and will make it so simple for us to wire up this character so he's easy to animate.	CHITCHAT
Will get a walk cycle going well.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully do all of that in that one stream on Wednesday that will be at 8:30 Eastern Daylight Time.	CHITCHAT
Wednesday, July 1st, Canada day.	CHITCHAT
I'll be wearing red and white for Canada, maybe inject some Canadian royalty free music if we can find it.	CHITCHAT

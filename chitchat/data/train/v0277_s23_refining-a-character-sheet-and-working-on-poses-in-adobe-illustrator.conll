But we'll celebrate Canada on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
While we are creating this animation, but will finish that rigging the rigging process from illustrator is also pretty simple because we've taken the time to really think about the structure of this character.	CHITCHAT
With our turnarounds, the rigging for this again without arms will just want to make sure that we've really thought through how these legs are going to bend, how the feet are going to move, and will make a couple of modifications to this.	CHITCHAT
Illustrator file to prepare for that.	CHITCHAT
Actually this this character right here.	O
And especially all that is going to be is defining on this character where let me create a layer and show you where the Benz are.	O
So for example, I probably want to figure out where the knee is going to be on this character and define it.	O
And we can do that really simply by just adding a circle.	O
It's making a different entirely different color.	O
Let's go with this note.	CHITCHAT
Silly here.	CHITCHAT
We got Green Green.	O
OK, so just figuring out where the knees are going to be.	O
And then I will split my leg up.	O
Into like the top part or the side and then the bottom part of the leg.	O
Import those into illustrator in pieces.	O
Along with these little circles to denote where the joints are going to be.	O
Also want to think about where the legs meet up with the body, so like where, where theoretically would his hips be there probably.	O
Probably about here.	O
Might want to move this ones down and so that will help us.	O
Why are up with the hipc to these, to the legs, and then again?	O
Make a copy of these.	O
Pull this down and think about where the ankles are and on this character again, they'll come down pretty low.	O
Be about here.	O
And here.	CHITCHAT
The points for the wings I don't need to worry about as much in the rigging.	O
These are going to be a part of that.	O
The only other piece that I will be defining which we don't need to do here will be the top of the head.	O
Which will be somewhere up here.	O
We don't have to worry about the body or a neck because character doesn't have one, and so the rigging process for this should actually go relatively smoothly and be pretty simple and so just with these guys will have a much easier time hooking it up with the duik plugin in after effects and getting this little guy animated.	O
Move let's go ahead and color in one more character, a kind of love this angry guys.	O
So I want to give him some color.	O
So what through this one more time?	O
Or we say goodnight.	CHITCHAT
If you joined the stream late tonight, we've been working on some character poses for this little character, whose name is chicken yellow.	O
Will be back on Wednesday to do that rigging and importing into after effects to complete rigging and then it begins some animation.	CHITCHAT
So if you've never done that, if you're interested in that, definitely join me on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
If you want to keep up to date with when the streams are, I will be posting schedules to be, hence Twitter and Instagram.	CHITCHAT
You can see the links for those profiles below this video and also if you follow me here on Behance, you'll get notifications whenever I go live so you never have to miss a stream but never fear if you do all of the videos, all the streams can be watched on demand.	CHITCHAT
Just go to the video tab in my deepest profile.	CHITCHAT
Of course, as always, please feel free to send me a message on Behance, Twitter, Instagram.	CHITCHAT
Wherever you can find me on social you have questions, ideas, things that you want to see me work on on the stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm always really happy to get your feedback and ideas.	CHITCHAT
It makes this work more fun, so let me have it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's do some quick shading here.	O
Ungroup the angry chicken yellow.	O
Refuse to.	CHITCHAT

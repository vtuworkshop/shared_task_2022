Yeah, well last time least minus front.	O
Shadow For this one I want to use this blue color.	O
I said this 2 two pixels.	O
And actually the same thing for these shapes.	O
The eyebrows in the little wrinkles below.	O
I'm just going to sample those.	O
Looking pretty good.	CHITCHAT
And then I want to create a little bit of shadow on the beach.	O
The same thing.	O
They did before.	CHITCHAT
OK you music again.	CHITCHAT
You don't need to.	CHITCHAT
You don't need to be that epic, it's getting late.	CHITCHAT
Awesome, thank you for joining.	CHITCHAT
Thanks again and hide the Ben.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate you turning in.	CHITCHAT
That's very sweet of you.	CHITCHAT
I hope you have a wonderful vacation.	CHITCHAT
And do not worry, we're holding down the Fort in your absence, everything is fine.	CHITCHAT
Particular, then I'll talk to you soon.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to finish up coloring this character and then.	O
Maybe will do all of 'em.	O
They don't take very long and then we'll call it a night.	O
I'm going to zoom in here.	O
So probably just duplicate these.	O
So I'm going to copy this leg.	O
And we'll take an intersection.	O
There, and I want this deeper red color.	O
Will also just do men.	O
And grab the.	O
Grab that segment tool there and just round it out a little bit.	O
And because of this copy is just for this left leg is a copy of this language is going to copy this?	O
Will transform it, flip it horizontally and bring it into place of delete this leg or do that.	O
Over a little bit.	O
And we'll see you back.	O
Make a copy of the swing.	O
Let's zoom in.	O
Will get rid of.	O
These two.	O
And I will just flip this one horizontally.	O
And drop that into place group it.	O
And I think last thing I want to do on this one is maybe make these.	O
Not quite so big snake, these just a one pixel.	O
Much better.	CHITCHAT
It's also.	O
Add a little bit to the hair.	O
Once you copy again.	O
Listen to the front.	O
Minus friend.	O
Grub that dark color.	O
Good to go, alright?	CHITCHAT
Let's group this one.	O
Let's do that one last sad character.	O
So we can call this complete, so I'm gonna make a copy of my black and white.	O
Zoom in here.	O
In colors back over.	O
All right?	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Not that sure is a little hard to see.	O
So we may make it.	O
Something bright or maybe even a white.	O

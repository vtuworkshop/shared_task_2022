This one and this one, and we're going to take their style from this one.	O
Alright, one last thing, let's create that.	O
That is shading on the hair.	O
And we don't have to worry too much about these thickness of this line.	O
It's going to disappear in a minute.	O
Popular.	CHITCHAT
There we go OK.	CHITCHAT
Now make a copy of the hair.	O
He said he will grab that intersection, choose the darker red.	O
And then group those two together.	O
OK, so there is our sad chicken yellow going to remove our color reference.	O
Let's censor this so we can take a look at what we got.	O
And let's do a wrap up.	O
So we finished coloring the four poses that we created for the chicken yellow character.	O
Each of them now have some shading.	O
They've got some great personality coming before that we had just created the black and white versions and these all were derived from these dynamic poses that we created above simply by deconstructing the character and recreating it out of the simplest set of geometric shapes we could and so in the case of chicken yellow.	O
That's simply a circle.	O
With some cylinders coming out for legs, some rectangular sort of shapes for the feet and some triangles for the wings really, really basic.	O
By doing that, we created these little building blocks that we can use to experiment with poses for the character, and then this way rather than sketching them out in these black-and-white forms right away, we can really get the poses right before we worry about the details in the character, so we worked on all of that tonight.	O
We refined our color palettes.	O
Of in the chicken yellow characters so that they are ready to use in other projects and reviewed what we did in our first stream, which was to create a turn around of our character to really get to know outside of the original sketch, just what this character looks like from each of the different views.	O
So from the front from a three quarter view from the side from the three quarter rear view and then the rear view, as well as experimenting with expressions, which is really fun.	O
Getting expressions right?	CHITCHAT
Or this character?	CHITCHAT
I can actually even as I look at this now, like I can kind of imagine turning these into a set of Emojis.	O
It's a lot of fun things that we could do, but our most immediate project is going to be taking chicken yellow and animating him.	O
So here he is.	CHITCHAT
This is what we've been working on for the last couple of days.	O
This is chicken yellow.	O
He is an egg yolk who came to life.	O
On Wednesday's stream, if you join us, the stream will start at 8:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time in that stream will be taking the character that we've been preparing for rigging over here.	O
Will be taking this this character the three quarter view of chicken yellow doing some finishing touches to get him ready for rigging in.	O
After effects will then import this illustrator file into after effects and using the duik plugin which is an animation and rigging tool, will rig up this character and hopefully get a walk cycle done on Wednesday.	O
So please join me Wednesday at 8:30 PM Eastern Daylight Time Canada day.	CHITCHAT
For those of you who are in the know come.	CHITCHAT

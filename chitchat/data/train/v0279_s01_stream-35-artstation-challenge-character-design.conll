Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so, uh, we were working on trying to remember what we're working on this stream specifically.	CHITCHAT
Last time.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'll show you guys where we're at so we did a little bit of the leader character.	O
We painted her up.	O
We worked her up a bit.	O
I'm kind of leaving her.	O
As is for now.	O
And dumb.	O
Whoops Just gotta get a chat where I can see it.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
All right, so this is what we're doing.	CHITCHAT
Or this is what we did previously?	O
This is Missy.	O
Another one of the characters will be working on today.	O
This is the one I'm going to be doing for this stream.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
This is that the state of that specific character, so very, very loose right now.	O
We're going to be basing that concept off of these designs.	O
And this character.	O
So we're working on.	O
Previously, these are her designs that we did up, so we were doing all these kind of rough costumes initially and now we're going to be going through and actually.	O
Doing each character doing their finished painting.	O
Sorry if suppose ignoring you.	O
Here there poses.	O
This is the initial idea I had for their poses, and now we just gotta kind of drum up and finish him so.	O
Still a lot to do, but we've designed all the costumes, or at least roughly at least.	O
Got some ideas going there, not necessarily clean, presentable, like concept sheets yet, but we got a sheet for each character no matter or, you know, regardless of how rough.	O
And I think that's enough.	CHITCHAT
We're trying to work with a time limit here.	O
This is really artstation challenge.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I didn't specify that, but it's called box of mystery.	O
It's designing 6 characters.	O
They all have a specific trait that they're supposed to be based off of.	O
This character is serious.	O
He's like a historian and scholar.	O
That's his costume leader is another one.	O
She's the leader of the group.	O
And then there's from left to right, serious, brave, joyful, Miss Chievous Wild, an leader OM.	O
And I'm just going to go through, I think left to right and just try to try to get him going.	O
So this is what we did yesterday.	O
I don't know if we worked on this one on stream.	O
I was doing the line work initially.	O
Maybe I did that here on stream and I kind of painted up outside of that.	O
So that was the line work for the character.	O
Kind of what the characters looking like now and she's alright.	O
You know she's worked up enough for now.	O
I was thinking about doing a levels adjustment or something just to boost the brightness.	O
She's pretty dark right now.	O
Her or lights need to be pushed quite a bit.	O
Going to duplicating is why not control L?	O
Actually, let's get our little extension up first so we can record all these functions that I'm doing in photo shop.	O
So control Li could just make an adjustment layer, but I don't care about working destructively right now, so.	O
Yeah, it's fine for now, just a little boost.	O
Alright, we'll save that.	O
And we're going to work on this guy now.	O
I'm kind of liking the top middle costume so far so.	O
Probably what will be working with.	O
1 second, I just gotta check on my Kitty here.	CHITCHAT
Make sure he's not getting into trouble.	CHITCHAT
Eminem for though.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm just trying to keep the windows open so I can get a little breeze through here.	CHITCHAT

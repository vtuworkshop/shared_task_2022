This room heats up so much, but then the kitties get near the window and there's a big hole in the screen.	CHITCHAT
Stresses me out.	CHITCHAT
Home every damn come on man is it going to take my.	CHITCHAT
Light over.	CHITCHAT
Zoo I close the door you guys make so much trouble.	CHITCHAT
So I could.	CHITCHAT
Probably Eminem bro.	CHITCHAT
Come on.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have to kick these guys out.	CHITCHAT
It's not there, I just want a cool room, but then they room heats up so much when I shut the door.	CHITCHAT
So I may do a little painting layer first.	O
Just kind of.	O
The Heck Why is my?	O
Brush tilted.	O
I was strange.	CHITCHAT
Like a strange tilt to it anyway, it's gone.	O
As well.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to take the colors we have.	O
Paint in.	O
A little confused by.	O
Why is this painting over his sketch?	O
There's no reason that makes any sense.	O
Is this photoshopped glitching?	O
This layer is showing underneath it.	O
Is that why was it just like the same exact color?	O
I think it's just like the same exact color was totally throwing me off.	O
I had a glitch sometime ago that was similar to that, so it wasn't actually sure.	O
Alright, will put both of those line layers.	O
I'm going to put them in their own Group Control G.	O
Will put both of those two line layers into a group called lines so I don't accidentally mess with it.	O
'cause I have a tendency of doing that.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So I tend to jump back and forth between drawing and painting.	O
It's kind of a combination of like.	O
Sometimes I think a little bit better in shape.	O
Sometimes I think a little bit better.	O
In line, but I like to kind of see them together.	O
I used to do like strict line layers and strict painting layers.	O
Now I cannot jump between him a little bit more like right now.	O
I kind of want to see the shape and the color palette on the character.	O
So the Super rough masquerade here.	O
As you can see.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Then I'm going to lock those transparencies so I can pretty much just.	O
Do what I want with the.	O
Colours actually.	O
One thing I know I was talking about.	O
Before was doing flag colors and I don't usually do those.	O
But feeling like flag colors may be a good idea for how I've been working.	O
Essentially just.	O
Painting in color sections.	O
Maybe that's what we'll do first.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Going to feel like this will just give me a good base to draw on top of.	O

Maybe like that.	CHITCHAT
Trying to think how we could be holding it here.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately, can't screencap that.	O
This is the most get away I'm doing things ever.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Going to see what happened to my.	O
My webcam there alright so.	O
Super ghetto but.	O
Let's go to, uh?	CHITCHAT
Let's go to the stream, try to screen cap it.	CHITCHAT
Go to.	CHITCHAT
Oh alright.	CHITCHAT
Alright, Here we go.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Whatever, whatever works.	CHITCHAT
So there's that, but the angle of the hand that's like more tucked in my side.	O
His is more creating a triangle, so I wanted to get something that works with that.	O
The green screen is.	O
All sorts of messed up.	CHITCHAT
That it.	CHITCHAT
Trying to figure out what to do with my thumbs.	O
But you try that.	O
We can certainly try that.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
When you save it.	O
Kind of like the positioning of his arms, so I'm going to try to adapt the book.	O
To the hands, this is what I typically do.	O
I'll sketch out my ideas first.	O
And then get reference after the fact that like matches what I already drew.	O
Sometimes I like what I already drew.	O
Sometimes the references just looks more natural and looks better, and in that case it doesn't matter what I drew, will just redo it, but.	O
In this instance.	O
And most of 'em I kind of think I like what I got with the initial sketch pose.	O
So we'll see.	O
This will draw like the place where the hands would be neat.	O
Trying to get like a nice graphic shape here.	O
That is a big and heavy looking book.	O
Yeah is actually may be too big.	O
I don't think I'm going to make his that big.	O
I was just like what's the biggest book I got 'cause he's holding a pretty hefty one.	O
They don't have a lot of massive books.	O
So hands can be really tricky.	O
And what I was just doing, which is.	O
I think a habit that I found myself doing even now, even though I know I shouldn't, is like trying to get the shape.	O
This is what I want to do.	O
What I'm about to say is getting the big shape I was getting into details and just trying to copy too early.	O

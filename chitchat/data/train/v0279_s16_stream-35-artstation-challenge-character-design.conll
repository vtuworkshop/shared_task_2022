But like I want to, I want to center that shaped like where is, where is the mass of the hands lying?	O
It's right about there so.	O
And then this hand kind of goes in.	O
See the thumb of it.	O
Tips of the fingers.	O
Just trying to separate the two hand shapes.	O
'cause again like you can draw out into each individual finger and everything but like.	O
You want to see what the shape is that it creates 'cause he can drop their hands like super detailed.	O
Get all the fingers in all the joints and then when you're done with it, you'll be like that looks awful.	O
I try to get the big shapes.	O
So I can determine from the get go like is this.	O
Is this whole pose in the hands of the shapes it creates it working at all?	O
And one thing I'm noticing is his sleeves probably need to be moved in.	O
There's all this arm here.	O
But this leaves are kind of far back which could still work like I could put like a.	O
I don't know, but like another layer club.	O
Excuse me, but at this point actually this doesn't make sense because the elbow would be about here.	O
So we have to figure that out.	O
There's a couple things that I can do.	O
God duplicate this later 'cause I'm about to make some drastic changes.	O
I'm going to move the whole mass of the hands.	O
To this side.	O
Now perspectively, not the word right perspectively in terms of perspective that may not look too good because.	O
In my reference, my hands are.	O
Going out from the center of my body so they're like further out here.	O
So let's move his.	O
Sleeves and arms.	O
In towards the center of his body, a little bit more.	O

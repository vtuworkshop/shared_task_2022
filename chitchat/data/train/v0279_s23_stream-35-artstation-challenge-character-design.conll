Always been really attracted to good line art.	O
Yeah, are you talking about like pieces with Line Art in the finished product?	O
Or you just talking in general about like good sketches and good drawings?	O
The thing is like I find it a little harder to justify spending too long on the line art.	O
When it doesn't show.	O
In the past I've cleaned up my line art and all this and.	O
Feels like a bit of a waste when when it's like extra time spent that I don't really need to be spending.	O
But you know the drawing being good like the construction.	O
The perspective, all that that's what's important.	O
And obviously usually if you spend longer the line drawing you going to be spending longer on the construction.	O
Like I said, admittedly something I probably.	O
Could be working on more.	O
But in the last five minutes of the stream.	O
5 minutes or so, let's get back into the painting.	O
I think we've change things quite a bit, so it's probably going to look pretty pretty off.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like the gesture of this is quite different.	O
The silhouette is quite different, so there's the silhouette we had.	O
Thanks, I can maybe the shapes now.	O
I'll go with the blue for now.	O
I'm going to duplicate it.	O
I'll be curious if like this better.	O
So it's frustrating if I'm like you know what I don't actually like that better.	O
Merge the head drawing with this.	O
Do lines.	O
Lock that.	O
All right now will edit this to fit.	O
There's no real point to warping it, it's all wrong anyway, so let's just say forget it.	O
Get out are Hardy racer are round brush and just go for it.	O
I don't know if these lines are on multipliers.	O
I'm going to do that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that really is better.	CHITCHAT
So we'll do this for a bit until I gotta jump off and then we'll kind of maybe it.	O
Let's see how far we can get.	O
And as you can see, I'm just going to be really, really sure that.	O
Again, it's just about a graphic read, so if the shapes are kind of close, all least be able to get it.	O
Get a good idea even on the right path.	O
I really hope this is going to be an improvement shape wise.	O
I finish this and then I ate be the shapes and it's a worse.	O
Would be like Alright?	CHITCHAT
I don't even know where to go from there.	O
But I don't think that will be the case.	O

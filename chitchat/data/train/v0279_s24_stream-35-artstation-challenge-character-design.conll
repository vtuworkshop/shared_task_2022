It will save.	O
Yeah, get you if you're not gonna show it in the end.	O
Makes sense to give it more loose yet like Karl Kopinski stuff.	O
Actually I think I have a.	CHITCHAT
I literally have a collage reference.	CHITCHAT
I make a lot of these lines collage.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Flies.	CHITCHAT
To mess with Maine.	CHITCHAT
Windows, don't you mess with me?	CHITCHAT
I know you know what file?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, here we go.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, make a lot of these collage references to kind of like find a look of whatever it is.	CHITCHAT
There's so many things like maybe it's texture that I'm into at the moment, or lighting or blind work or whatever and I try to find like collages of like the bar like I'm trying to hit or the look or feel.	O
I'm trying to go for just to keep like the goal in mind.	O
Because it's it's nice to have these inspiration images, but.	O
That's weird.	CHITCHAT
Very odd, just getting glitches all day, windows and otherwise.	O
This is a few different artists.	O
That's Karl Kopinski at the top, so stuff like this I think would be fine.	O
For painting you can be like is loose the messy as you want.	O
And like all those descriptor lines are helpful in the painting process for Maine and they don't really get in the way when I'm painting over him.	O
This one on the left.	O
I like how loose it is.	CHITCHAT
All the shapes are definitely there like details, even like the straps.	O
These little bands on the dagger you can see those like to indicate it doesn't need to be perfect and clean, but it's enough to know like how to paint it.	O
And the structure is all there, of course.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I think this is Evan Mellow Munson on the left here.	O
A creepy picture.	O
And we gotta, what's his name?	O
Sanchez Sketch sent Sanchez something like that.	O
Block Sanchez Yeah, I think Block Sanchez.	O
That's that's super cool.	CHITCHAT
Spylo else Sanchez, Sanchez.	O
I really say it.	CHITCHAT
Grant Griffin, I think this is Grant Griffins in the middle.	O
I think those are like the only three artists on here, but anyway, that kind of loose sketching I think is really cool.	O
Depending on like how detailed you actually want to go.	O
Alright, I think that's where we're going to call this one for today.	CHITCHAT

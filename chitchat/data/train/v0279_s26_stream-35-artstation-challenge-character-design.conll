That does that look good, 'cause that changes it completely.	CHITCHAT
Now it looks like there's a big collar on him with a gold trim which is.	O
Cool, maybe not the field that I want, but cool.	CHITCHAT
So just things like that quick little changes just to see graphically.	CHITCHAT
It makes the design better.	CHITCHAT
That's why I like working in shape sometimes.	CHITCHAT
And In conclusion, I guess so I think I'm going to call it there we will be back on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
With another design or another stream working on these character designs, if you guys did not see the previous one we were working on, it was this character the leader character?	CHITCHAT
She's the leader, as you would imagine by that title he is the serious character and in this little narrative I came up with this little crew that they're all apart of.	CHITCHAT
He's the historian and scholar of the group, who is the most knowledge of the box of mystery, the covenant of the box of mystery, the history around the origin of the group, everything that's happened to him throughout the 100 years, hundreds of years, I should say.	CHITCHAT
There's six characters total.	CHITCHAT
Still gotta work on.	CHITCHAT
On all of them quite a bit to do.	CHITCHAT
Originally we did the sketch for all the poses of the characters, and then I did these costume designs or we went through and tried to just brainstorm some ideas for the costumes.	CHITCHAT
And dumb.	CHITCHAT
Now it's actually taking this characters, putting the costumes on him and painting him up, so this character on the right will work on him again.	CHITCHAT
I'm basically going to do the same thing I did on the character directly to the left of him, which is just painted up a little bit.	CHITCHAT
This is not finished, it clearly, but just get the basic.	CHITCHAT
Values and ideas down pretty simply so.	CHITCHAT
I don't know where will be when we come back on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be streaming on Twitch tomorrow so I will be working on this character on Twitch Stream a little bit earlier in the morning about 11:30 Pacific Time on Twitch, so I'll definitely get some work done on this, but I don't know where we will be back on Wednesday 'cause I'll be streaming.	CHITCHAT
Actually this on Twitch Tuesday and Wednesday, Wednesday on my behalf stream we may be on a different character actually, because I'm really trying to use this week to use a little extra time that I have to hit these characters hard 'cause the deadline is coming up.	CHITCHAT
July 13th so.	CHITCHAT
Still a lot to do in like less than two weeks.	CHITCHAT
Or just just about two weeks I think.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Plus we seen shapes anyway.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, for sure that's like the big impression that you see.	CHITCHAT
Are those shapes so making sure they read well even just flat colors, I think is really beneficial.	CHITCHAT
With that said.	CHITCHAT
Think I'm gonna head out.	CHITCHAT
I'll see you guys again on Wednesday if you want to stop by my twitch streams.	CHITCHAT
I'll be streaming tomorrow as well as Wednesday before might be and stream.	CHITCHAT
So because we wanted to watch more of this character, that's probably the best way to see it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure which one will be doing next.	CHITCHAT
Probably the brave character.	CHITCHAT
The little guy.	CHITCHAT
If you guys saw him.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, I gotta run.	CHITCHAT
I'm out.	CHITCHAT

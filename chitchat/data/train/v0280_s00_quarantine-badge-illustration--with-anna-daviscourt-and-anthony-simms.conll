Hello and welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
Nice to see you again.	CHITCHAT
I am Anna Davis Court this is Anthony Sims over there haha and we are here today to have another little fun draw along.	CHITCHAT
We were going to do something a little bit different today so one of my fellow streamers on be hands Ryan Selby if you guys haven't followed him please do.	CHITCHAT
He does amazing work.	CHITCHAT
His name is Ryan like you would normally Ryan and then SELY.	CHITCHAT
Is the last part of his name, so please go follow him and he put up a a proposition to us streamers saying that we could do weekly challenges together and that would be really fun.	CHITCHAT
So I am super down with that.	CHITCHAT
Love the idea.	CHITCHAT
So his theme for the first week is Quarantine.	CHITCHAT
What was it called Florentine?	CHITCHAT
Sorry 1 second I'm going to find the exact wording Correntina Wars Wu so this is the idea is like we're awarding people something like a trophy or a badge or something like that to kind of set.	O
Liberate the little wins that we've had while in Quarantine, so I have a few ideas of what we can do today, and so I hope you guys just follow along.	O
Maybe make something yourself and just tag it weekly challenge and we will make stuff around to look at and gush over.	O
Thank you Anthony for posting it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Anthony, would you like to say anything to the people welcome.	CHITCHAT
I hope we all get to earn badges.	O
I was just telling you now that I don't get the badge of showered today, but maybe tomorrow.	O
Yeah, tomorrow is always another day.	CHITCHAT
You know you get a chance for another batch so it's all good.	O
So I'm just starting with a totally blank canvas here and I wanted to sketch along with you guys 'cause we don't always get to do that like just from beginning to end offering the layers over here I would I always forget to turn on.	O
There's an extension that we have called tool timeline and I believe it's just when watching this back.	O
But basically it captures all of the tools that I'm using so that you guys can see exactly like what I'm doing on the computer side of things.	O
But if you ever have any questions, let me know.	CHITCHAT
Until in the chat saying hello hello, yes I'm excited.	CHITCHAT
It fits in with my badge idea I was making for my book club stream Oh my gosh, amazing Kendall.	O
We're all on the same wavelength.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
So first I'm just trying out the general shapes that I'm thinking for the badges and lovely to see you.	O
By the way, Kendall I forgot to say Hi Hi.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being here and Anthony.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for being here is well, we always enjoy you.	CHITCHAT
Did you see all the like the love and the missing you from last week?	CHITCHAT
Do you not times in the chat?	CHITCHAT
Yes, but did you see other people they were like, Oh Anthony, he could have helped so much when she's just stumbling over her words.	CHITCHAT
True, so true.	CHITCHAT
OK, so my idea for this one is to have somebody wearing a mask and.	O
Somebody I don't know what they look like, but then have the badge read like around them and embroidered letters I save lives.	O
Because wearing a mask right now is one of the easiest ways to save lives.	CHITCHAT
It's crazy how much of an effect it has if you guys haven't seen the Petri dishes that people like saying or sneeze or talk over and it's with or without a mask, it's insane.	CHITCHAT
The amount of just little water particles that carried the germs are on the ones without a mask in are not on the ones with the mask, so please wear a mask is very, very important, and it's literally the least you can do.	CHITCHAT

It's so easy and.	CHITCHAT
Not at all.	CHITCHAT
The problem that people are making out to be so suck it up.	CHITCHAT
Wear the mask.	CHITCHAT
So I think with this one that that idea works with the circle.	CHITCHAT
And I just want to try it with the Diamond 'cause I think diamonds are really cool shapes, but we'll see what works best.	CHITCHAT
Maybe their hair is kind of triangular?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
This is an opportunity as well to do a little bit of like character design.	CHITCHAT
So that will be fun.	CHITCHAT
Characters lines always good, by the way.	CHITCHAT
My character design classes classes dropping very soon on SBS they just posted yesterday about it, so I'm super excited about that.	CHITCHAT
and I gotta, I gotta re tweet and all that stuff shared about.	CHITCHAT
Where do they post it?	CHITCHAT
Instagram and Twitter on the SBS cage.	CHITCHAT
So far, as much as I've seen, I really think I might delete my Facebook.	CHITCHAT
I'm not very active on there and it just feels like a burden sometimes so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
We've got Kendall my chat saying I made myself a new mask and I'm happy 'cause it's from a vintage curtain.	CHITCHAT
My grandmother made back when my dad was a child, reused up cycle into lifesaving fun.	CHITCHAT
Also a chance to get my sewing skills in order.	CHITCHAT
And then we've gotta Shake Green in the chat saying, I'm glad I'm able to catch these streams every so often.	CHITCHAT
It's always great to see you both.	CHITCHAT
See you Jake takes a good friend.	CHITCHAT
I could sing you and then we've got Kindle in the chat greeting him saying Hello Chick Green.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to stream, absolutely.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it is so nice to see everybody pop in from time to time is like oh this thing what?	CHITCHAT
What's SBS?	CHITCHAT
Jake says you haven't been here for my many, many tangents.	CHITCHAT
Uh, so we get the affiliate links out again.	CHITCHAT
Do you have those?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I've got the one year long one.	CHITCHAT
You said you also have a monthly one, but you get started here.	CHITCHAT
I think it like you said, it was a better deal for a year long one.	CHITCHAT
Money up front so I always wonder, but there is a deal going on at SPS right now.	CHITCHAT
Which is Jacob is an online school for illustration and it is amazing.	CHITCHAT
It's founded by Will Terry, Jake Parker both amazing in their own right.	CHITCHAT
So then the third one is my personal mentor Lee white.	CHITCHAT
And also he was a teacher of ours at school.	CHITCHAT
Uh, Anthony had him as well, right?	CHITCHAT
You guys are taking classes with leaving right with white?	CHITCHAT
Yes, not tape at home.	CHITCHAT
Regret in your life because I took a class from David home on SVS and he was an amazing instructor.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, it is one of my regrets from not taking a class from him at AI.	CHITCHAT
When I had the opportunity, but I'm glad that there is another form factor where it still available.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely he is a wonderful teacher and he only worked together a lot in Portland when Lee lived here, so I feel like they're kind of I don't know, like brother, teachers.	CHITCHAT
But David Cone is now teaching at PNC A in Portland, which is our local art college anyways.	CHITCHAT
What are the things he also teaches on SBS?	CHITCHAT
So if you ever want to take David home class, there is a open studio with Pascal Campion.	CHITCHAT
There's a, uh, oh gosh, I'm forgetting names that I know these people very well.	CHITCHAT
Vesper Vesper Stamper, right, is that her name.	CHITCHAT
She's amazing illustrator.	CHITCHAT
She also has a class on there along with weak goodwill Terry Jake Parker at me and many many other amazing artists.	CHITCHAT
So there are plenty of people catch there and it is actually going on right now that they have a deal for a free month.	CHITCHAT
So you get to just try it out.	CHITCHAT
See what you like and you can fit a lot into a month.	CHITCHAT
So if you have the time to just like hunker down and learn, you could just.	CHITCHAT
Really, rings are worth out of that and get all the classes under your belt.	CHITCHAT
There's everything from.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Oh you found this for Stanford game.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, so there are there art classes for skill building.	CHITCHAT
There's art classes for like a specific things.	CHITCHAT
They actually do portfolio reviews, so if you have like a weakness, they can work with you.	CHITCHAT
1 on one kind of I think, and then the business side of it as well covered as well.	CHITCHAT
So there are a lot of different things to learn.	CHITCHAT
Everybody has their own spin on it, the the community forums are really really active, so everybody who goes to school there which are also amazing artists like there.	CHITCHAT
Their students have made names for themselves already, so it's It's like a tried and true method.	CHITCHAT

He goes through the SBS courses and you come out in illustrator so those students are also in the forums, constantly helping each other create work and come up with ideas and talk about the podcasts and all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
The podcast is free, is called 3 point perspective and you could also find it on the website sbslearn.com.	CHITCHAT
So there's a tab for that and it's totally free and full of such such great information.	CHITCHAT
So at the very least, listen to the podcast.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that podcast is also available on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
Yes, they have the film version, which is so goofy 'cause I just I love watching them.	CHITCHAT
It's funny 'cause I think the first few times that they filmed it they forgot that they were filming.	CHITCHAT
Kind of and especially with the podcast you kind of get into the mindset of like my words or what's important.	CHITCHAT
Not what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
So you'll catch Lee like playing with stuff on camera and like breaking things.	CHITCHAT
And you know.	CHITCHAT
So we've got shake green in the chat saying, OK, I've definitely heard of and seen their courses.	CHITCHAT
I didn't put the acronym together of SBS.	CHITCHAT
Then Kendall says movies sound like fun and then Jake Green saying Dang those are amazing offerings.	CHITCHAT
An artists and Kendall saying I'll have to check out these in more detail now that I know there's a free trial option.	CHITCHAT
Kendall goes on to say I'm taking illustration for motions so it will be good to supplement with my course and then Shakespearean saying thank you so much for all the info and links.	CHITCHAT
Please please a check it out for yourself, but also know that if you are paying for those classes, it's not going to some great Big Corporation.	CHITCHAT
It's literally like they put the money forward for more classes to be made so that you can also feel good supporting them and know that their Endeavour is basically just to make better online assets for people, especially now they were ahead of the curve.	CHITCHAT
But I mean all three of them have taught at University level and they know they all knew coming out of the University level.	CHITCHAT
Teaching positions that they wanted to make things more readily accessible to more people because it's crazy how expensive art colleges are now, so knowing that that is not something that has to be that way, they decided we're going to fix it.	CHITCHAT
And they, I think, just recently update from like 03 week, two or three months or something like that.	CHITCHAT
So you're coming in at a good time.	CHITCHAT
So what do we like him, diamond or circle?	O
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
We could also try other shapes.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
There's like the shield shape.	O
Anthony Jackson, saying sounds so cool.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for the info and then Kindles say Kindle saying I feel like School of motion and SPS need to team up for those who are in motion design illustration had yet.	CHITCHAT
I think there are always up for things like that, so if you ever go into the forums and are just like hey, by the way, there's another really great online school.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that'll take you up, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Uh, OK, we're going to have to start doing like votes or something in the chat for what this character is going to be.	CHITCHAT
Weather gonna look like what attributes do we want to give to them and letting are you feeling anything strongly?	CHITCHAT
Of the circle shielder diamond shape the shapes and also the character.	O
Like who do you envision this being?	O
Yeah, I think if you could draw someone, that's my zinc as that seems to be a common complaint with people wearing masks is you lose the facial expression.	O
So smizing definitely needs to come across so that.	O
People are.	CHITCHAT
One thing to wear a mask and don't feel like it's going to like cover off an essential part of their expression.	CHITCHAT
Well, there's also the option of making a smile on the the mask, so yeah.	CHITCHAT
Goodbye.	CHITCHAT
Just like Sharpie it.	CHITCHAT
But then I don't want to breathe in Sharpie.	CHITCHAT
So that's true.	CHITCHAT
You could do some.	CHITCHAT
What is it called?	CHITCHAT
Where you like.	CHITCHAT
Is that called embroidery?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK, yeah, embroidering.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking cross stitch for some reason, but I don't know if that's right when everything cross stitch I always think well cross stitch La Cross stitch.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I do cross stitch's kid.	CHITCHAT

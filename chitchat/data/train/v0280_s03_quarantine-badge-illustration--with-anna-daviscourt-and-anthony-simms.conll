A need for new mass.	CHITCHAT
There are some really awesome ones being sold by Lily Williams who is an amazing children's book illustrator.	CHITCHAT
She did a series of books about endangered species, so like what would the world look like if sharks or polar bears no longer existed?	CHITCHAT
All that kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
They are amazing and she is also just session amazing person sell starter an also talking about really important issues without fear like she's amazing.	CHITCHAT
So she made a series of masks on her society six page.	CHITCHAT
That says, think the first like round of them are just different colors of morons.	CHITCHAT
Don't wear these across.	CHITCHAT
This is so great.	CHITCHAT
And then there was another one.	CHITCHAT
I think that was black lives matter I think.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but she's just pumping him out at this point.	CHITCHAT
Like just making designs for people to wear their thoughts on their faces.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's an opportunity like why have a blank mask when you could say something with it.	CHITCHAT
That's true especially with all the pattering patterning that unique.	CHITCHAT
You could put corgis on there, or those bumble bees.	CHITCHAT
I only just saw her making these masks in like Society 6 mixmax.	CHITCHAT
I should totally put everything on there 'cause that would be so fun like not to make profit.	CHITCHAT
But just like to make masks so I could buy them.	CHITCHAT
I have my own.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I I would love to test the quality of everything they're making as well.	CHITCHAT
So we've got Kindle in the chat saying I also got approval to stream my homework when I start classes so soon.	CHITCHAT
Of it, and then Kendall goes on to ask what about a profile perspective in one of the batches?	CHITCHAT
And then she says yes, embroidery and then Jake Green says, OMG Smizing That's a new one for me.	CHITCHAT
Makes sense?	CHITCHAT
Do you wanna explain where that came from?	CHITCHAT
Anthony?	CHITCHAT
Well I was never as much of an avid watcher as you were, but it's from America's Next Top Model for Tyra Banks says that you have to smile with your eyes and then just made the contraction of Smizing	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's an empty smile.	CHITCHAT
I'm drying :) I know you can't see it right now, but once you squished those cheeks up just slightly, it's like it's like I don't know intensifying your eyes.	CHITCHAT
The muscles around them type.	CHITCHAT
Blue steel.	CHITCHAT
Your mouth does nothing for guys to everything.	CHITCHAT
Are you smiling hard?	CHITCHAT
Come on, we gotta do it together 123.	CHITCHAT
It just looks like it's trying to.	CHITCHAT
OK baby.	CHITCHAT
I hope everyone at home is smiling 'cause you better you better be.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, but that is actually a thing in a drawing.	CHITCHAT
Faces and art like making it feel like the smile reaches the eyes so that you don't just have like blanks to rise.	CHITCHAT
And then the smile.	CHITCHAT
That's creepy.	CHITCHAT
You gotta kind of squish the cheeks up a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Have a little bit less of the eyes showing.	CHITCHAT
It just makes it look friendlier like it's really genuine.	CHITCHAT
Candles definitely smiling.	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
And I was saying in the chat earlier my sister made my mother's mask embroidered and that my fave mask masks that look like someone else is face.	CHITCHAT
What, so you're wearing?	CHITCHAT
Somebody else is based on your face, yeah?	CHITCHAT
Like their nose and mouth Porsche.	CHITCHAT
That's a little scary, but I mean, I guess it's the same idea as having the smile on here is just more photo realistic in my mind that I wanted to be.	CHITCHAT
I hope it to be like a cute little cartoon mouse instead of like I have Anthony's mouth smiling at you.	CHITCHAT
Remember on the DSI that facial melding thing where it's like my eyes and your hair?	CHITCHAT
I was really weird.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, they just cut out your face and kind of like blended at the edges on my head.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it was not good.	CHITCHAT
Somewhere on this computer is here.	CHITCHAT
Disturbing.	CHITCHAT
Jake Green says very good demonstrations.	CHITCHAT
Yes, very important.	CHITCHAT
And then Kendall says no stewardess smiles here.	CHITCHAT
Anime mouth masks would be hilarious.	CHITCHAT
Anime about Oh my gosh, yes, I am very in favor of like the really cool like you are an anime character mask where they just design it to look and I love them.	CHITCHAT
I'm almost convinced to buy like a really robust ask where like it's built out and it's not a soft one.	CHITCHAT

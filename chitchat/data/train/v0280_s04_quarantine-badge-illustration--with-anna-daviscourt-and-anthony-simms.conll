It's more hard.	CHITCHAT
So that it's not hitting your face and it's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not like you have to adjust it to make it comfortable.	CHITCHAT
It just is every single time.	CHITCHAT
And if there's like a really cool design, why not I want to be like an anime character.	CHITCHAT
Wear my pink wig around so.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know where to get them yet.	CHITCHAT
I just want to fashion to really run with the whole mask idea and come up with entire head garbs where it keeps people at least six feet away 'cause it's so big and it's also filtering all of the air that comes into your vicinity.	CHITCHAT
Got it.	CHITCHAT
But I was selling James like after this is.	CHITCHAT
After we have a vaccine after something changes and we feel like we're going back to life with people, I'm definitely going to keep up on wearing masks whenever I feel a little bit sick and just normalize that.	CHITCHAT
That idea of like what they have in Japan, people wear masks all the time because they just don't want to get other people sick.	CHITCHAT
That seems normal.	CHITCHAT
Let's do that.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says same fashion masks needed.	CHITCHAT
I need more so they could match my T-shirts, agreed?	CHITCHAT
Got a match?	CHITCHAT
Oh Anthony Zahar degree.	CHITCHAT
He loves matching.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, do you remember like all of high school you would like color block all your outfits if your shoes were red, there was some other read part of your outfit, you know.	CHITCHAT
And then the white.	CHITCHAT
And it's just like two colors always together and I'd always color coordinate my underwear too.	CHITCHAT
Even though nobody would see it for me.	CHITCHAT
Will you have to at that point?	CHITCHAT
By the way, what are you guys feeling front facing or profile facing?	CHITCHAT
Male or female?	CHITCHAT
Kind of characteristics?	CHITCHAT
What do we feel in?	CHITCHAT
Should we just do Tyra Banks?	CHITCHAT
Kindle in the chat saying it's normalized in a lot of Asian countries.	CHITCHAT
My original mask was actually one that I hoarded from my trip to Vietnam back in 2012.	CHITCHAT
As it should be.	CHITCHAT
And then I think she is agreeing.	CHITCHAT
Yes that we should do Tyra Banks, OK?	CHITCHAT
Tyrone Tire show is a wild ride.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
Anthony Jackson in the chat saying I feel the front facing is more effective.	CHITCHAT
Meet you.	CHITCHAT
The pressures on baby this is a badge that you're wearing on your like Girl Scout.	CHITCHAT
What do you call it like sash that they have?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Gotta be an effective kind of.	CHITCHAT
Look like you look at it for a second and you understand what's going on.	CHITCHAT
And then Kendall, and that's right, saying yes to everything.	CHITCHAT
I think the one in the top right hand corner where it's in profile would be a nice one for if you did decide to do like.	CHITCHAT
Of showered today.	CHITCHAT
Masking it with just feel like shower hitting the person said.	CHITCHAT
Making a note.	CHITCHAT
Valley showers are weird.	CHITCHAT
And then Kindle in the chat saying you could do three quarter perspective.	CHITCHAT
That might be a little easier to see if you want the profile and then Jake Green saying I think front facing can offer more opportunity for the character personality, but the profile does have the stronger silhouette icon ography like on a coin.	CHITCHAT
And then Jake goes on to say Eiffel, I vote front.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for an official vote Kendall.	CHITCHAT
Do you have an official vote and do you guys cancel each other out?	CHITCHAT
Anthony?	CHITCHAT
Well, Kendall had said yes to everything.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, yes.	CHITCHAT
Everything so that means everything is fine, right?	CHITCHAT
But then Kendall also said maybe a three quarter perspective.	CHITCHAT
I mean 3/4, that's just.	CHITCHAT
Talk.	CHITCHAT
Jake Green says that's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
I'm assuming about this shower badge.	O
You'll see in about 20 seconds how I see it.	CHITCHAT
It's coming along.	CHITCHAT
Something about the mouth, an like heavy snoot almost makes it look animalistic.	O
Not quite human, but I like it.	O

It's good.	CHITCHAT
It reminds me of.	CHITCHAT
Imagine.	CHITCHAT
Berenstein bears or something totally yeah, I can still see that anyone.	CHITCHAT
Um, Kendall says official official vote for all of the options.	CHITCHAT
Speaking of voting, I voted yesterday that could be a badge voted.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, yes.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, the most important bad driver.	CHITCHAT
Check Queen says I love these.	CHITCHAT
Sure.	CHITCHAT
Showered, that's weird word.	CHITCHAT
Don't laugh at me.	CHITCHAT
I'm laughing at the word showered 'cause, it's weird.	CHITCHAT
Showered.	CHITCHAT
But the shower has not.	CHITCHAT
Oh Golly, you need a separate like a badge for that one.	CHITCHAT
The shower head.	CHITCHAT
Hum shower head.	CHITCHAT
Power down.	CHITCHAT
I don't know it works out.	CHITCHAT
You get it, you get it.	CHITCHAT
I get it, I get it.	CHITCHAT
How do I change this shape around it to make it work better, but the idea OK and then the one for I voted I think is very important.	CHITCHAT
If you guys didn't see the latest or not the latest, it was a few John Oliver's ago.	CHITCHAT
The videos of last week tonight on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
There was one about voting by Mail.	CHITCHAT
I believe it was, and at the end he had stickers that you can print out for.	CHITCHAT
I voted by Mail and it was if they are hilarious and wonderful.	CHITCHAT
I printed them out.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately our printer without of colors that there black and white and on regular paper.	CHITCHAT
But you know, there's still fun and I like them.	CHITCHAT
So I I voted their 5 million ways of showing.	CHITCHAT
I voted that have been done already.	CHITCHAT
So what should we do?	CHITCHAT
We could just do like lettering and like a banner or something.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We can condemn the chat saying you could rent out the bottom and there could be a drop of water badge.	CHITCHAT
Round out the bottom.	CHITCHAT
Maybe for the shower one on like a teardrop shape for live shows.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's a good one.	CHITCHAT
I think that that could work.	CHITCHAT
The only problem is the shower head.	CHITCHAT
Still like if I cut off more of the top then, but we'll see.	CHITCHAT
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
I'll try it out in a second.	CHITCHAT
I just want to finish my phone on here.	CHITCHAT
We've got dumb in the chat saying, although Nico Hello, welcome, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Interesting.	CHITCHAT
Anything?	CHITCHAT
Kindle OJ Queen saying Hi Donna Ann in Kendall saying, I'm sad I didn't get a sticker 'cause they dropped my knock in the box and then Kindle saying high drama with welcome to the chat and then Thomas saying.	CHITCHAT
I hate you guys so much.	CHITCHAT
Last time you make me cry.	CHITCHAT
It's not not crying, it's not about that.	CHITCHAT
With the crying, laughing 'cause I felt that very deeply.	CHITCHAT
But I know today we are making badges, so I don't think will make you cry.	O
Maybe probably not, hopefully not.	CHITCHAT
But we're making batches for people in quarantine, so kind of celebrating the little wins.	O
And so my idea was to do maskan saying I'm saving lives.	O
'cause That's something that's super important that people need to do.	O
Please do.	CHITCHAT
And maybe if we celebrate it, maybe somebody will do it like Oh, a kid doesn't want to wear mask in these parents like but this badge.	O
You know you don't get it until you wear your mask.	CHITCHAT
Amen.	CHITCHAT
Uh, the other ones that we've come up with, so so far, like I showered.	CHITCHAT
I voted.	CHITCHAT
So if you have any ideas for badges, feel free to shout them out.	CHITCHAT
I think we'll take one forward to color soon.	CHITCHAT
Will get there.	CHITCHAT
In the limit chat saying lol.	CHITCHAT
I love that we leave messages randomly when people leave suddenly.	CHITCHAT
We leave messages randomly when people leave suddenly.	CHITCHAT
What does that mean?	CHITCHAT
Like last week, when Tom had to leave 'cause children were calling, I think we left a message for the replay and that one time user had to leave and we left a message.	CHITCHAT
I mean, you gotta say goodbye properly.	CHITCHAT
Come on, if they put in the time to type out, I'm going to watch the replay then I'm gonna take the time to say like something nice either.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I'm in the chat saying I re watched the replay around 10:00 PM in my husband saw me crying and he said what happened and I was like Anna Chan is cheering me up.	CHITCHAT

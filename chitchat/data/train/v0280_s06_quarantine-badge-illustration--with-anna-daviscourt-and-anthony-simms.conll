Oh my gosh Dama.	CHITCHAT
That's really sweet.	CHITCHAT
I love that I didn't know it.	CHITCHAT
Like literally major cry, 'cause of hopefully good feelings.	CHITCHAT
But you know, we're just trying to make happy times here, so don't cry and less.	CHITCHAT
It's like a positive stress relief.	CHITCHAT
That's good.	CHITCHAT
Which reminds me, I watched grave of the Fireflies Last Night.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, why?	CHITCHAT
Why would you ever do that in the year 2020?	CHITCHAT
Why it has been years since I watched it and I just remembered it being sad, but when I sat down to watch it again, I went in with like full intent of I want to feel an emotion of like sad.	CHITCHAT
OK Massicus How was it?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, well, I mean the same reason people watch scary movies right?	CHITCHAT
They want to feel like that visceral other feeling of being scared.	CHITCHAT
and I would rather be sad and scared I guess.	CHITCHAT
I'd rather be sad that scare.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I you don't have to be either.	CHITCHAT
You really don't know, Yeah, but sometimes you just get in a mood for it.	CHITCHAT
Or sometimes I do rather.	CHITCHAT
It works for you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that one was probably too sad.	CHITCHAT
I forgot how sad it was.	CHITCHAT
It's just sad and then it gets more sad and then the saddest ever.	CHITCHAT
There's no hope during any of it Saturday.	CHITCHAT
Just literally no.	CHITCHAT
Hope, it's just all downhill the entire time.	CHITCHAT
It's thoroughly depressed, so I think I'll watch it.	CHITCHAT
Different type of set movie next.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there are plenty of bad movies that have a happy ending and that isn't that how they define tragedy is like whether the ending is happy or sad.	CHITCHAT
So it could be that all the way through, but if the ending is happy is not a true tragedy, that's kind of the idea, right?	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Other people Kendall probably knows the exact definition of tragedy and comedy.	CHITCHAT
And then it's The Comedy Mask in the tragedy.	CHITCHAT
Mask, isn't that like?	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
But if?	CHITCHAT
Uh Oh no, I just left something bad if I made two batches and one was like the happy mask and then there was a sad mask and it was like I wore my message.	CHITCHAT
I save lives and then it went like it did for my mask and I killed people.	CHITCHAT
Oh, pretty tired and we're not going to go in her grave of the fireflies or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
So everybody's alive, everybody's happy.	CHITCHAT
Even though you never had 500,000 globally.	CHITCHAT
But, uh, we're not going to think about that at the moment.	CHITCHAT
We're going to think about fun designs and happy times, yeah, so we've got Kindle in the chat saying it's like the quality stamp that Charlie is so cool.	CHITCHAT
Like used to motivate him to make videos.	CHITCHAT
Huh, Charlie is so cool.	CHITCHAT
Charlie is so cool, is that the?	CHITCHAT
Where is that quality?	CHITCHAT
Used to motivate him to make videos.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea, but Kendall in lightness, what's the quality stamp and what is Charlie is so cool.	CHITCHAT
We've got time in the chat saying in the live stream he was like relax.	CHITCHAT
I really had a bad day that day and sometimes I watch the stream to relax and it seems the message really made my night.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
And then Kindle.	CHITCHAT
I'll go ahead.	CHITCHAT
Yes, and then Kindle saying I get you Anthony, I do that but I watch sad Buffy the vampire moments over and over like why do I do this to myself?	CHITCHAT
I feel something.	CHITCHAT
Wow uh, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Sorry guys.	CHITCHAT
Can't relate.	CHITCHAT
Don't ever sign up for a sad thing except for music.	CHITCHAT
I guess every once while I'm in the mood for like I'm sad.	CHITCHAT
I want to listen to some like really most us, but that's not not the same as like signing up for two hours of it.	CHITCHAT
It's like 2 minutes of it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Team that I actively avoid because they're two sides, whereas like that's quality thing.	CHITCHAT
Never again great for the final flag is excellent movie overall.	CHITCHAT
It's just so sad and depressing and lacks any type of hope for the characters that you're invested with.	CHITCHAT
We've got time in the chat saying, but it was funny that my husband thought I was fighting in life stream in Twitch.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes they get emotional in the comments when people are mean.	CHITCHAT
That's really nice, though.	CHITCHAT
You're like fighting 'cause they're being off their measure of Anthony on Overwatch.	CHITCHAT
If anybody's ever toxic in the chat, you're like the first to be like.	CHITCHAT
How about?	CHITCHAT
Not like, yeah, you better uncalled for.	CHITCHAT
No one wants to play that game with you were just here to play Overwatch.	CHITCHAT

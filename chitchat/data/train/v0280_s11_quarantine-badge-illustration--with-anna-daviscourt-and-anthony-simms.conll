We also have a book club that's happening soon ish.	CHITCHAT
Is the book thing.	CHITCHAT
Let's check out the current work from last week.	CHITCHAT
Uh, this is the bee pattern that DOMA was talking about that we did last week.	CHITCHAT
That was really fun to make.	CHITCHAT
That was mine.	CHITCHAT
This is Kendall's work in progress.	CHITCHAT
All the plant scandal.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, it's gonna be beautiful.	CHITCHAT
I mean it's already beautiful.	CHITCHAT
I love all the colors and tones going on.	CHITCHAT
Just wanted all.	CHITCHAT
Want it all and now with this little elf that reminds me of both Mario and the Keebler elf all at once, but now set.	CHITCHAT
Reminded them of Jeff sessions.	CHITCHAT
Like way cuter than Jeff Sessions.	CHITCHAT
And then we've got the official flag of be him thanks to our own Anthony Jackson.	CHITCHAT
So this is the flag that we all fall under now.	CHITCHAT
I hope you guys appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
A little peek at the discord going on right now.	CHITCHAT
Please be a part of it.	CHITCHAT
It's so fun.	CHITCHAT
And I lost it, yet they are.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to start throwing color on this 'cause I just feel like a little stagnant on the design and that's totally fine.	O
I just want to move forward with it.	O
What colors do you imagine for this?	O
I'm kind of thinking Earthtone, but that's just me.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I guess badges like if you had a set of badges, you would want them all to have a really unique color palette so that they kind of stand out from each other, or at least like a unique predominant colour within each of them.	O
Move in the shower one or green and the green for water sometimes.	O
One of my favorite combinations of colors of all time.	O
It's a good one.	CHITCHAT
A soft gasp emits from the boy.	O
Oh well, that did that come out out loud?	O
But we all sales.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
What are your thoughts?	CHITCHAT
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
I need to know.	CHITCHAT
I was trying to look up more pronunciation.	CHITCHAT
So you can not.	CHITCHAT
I'm just confused because they posted you pronounce the E correct, but the H is not necessary.	CHITCHAT
But when I see each together, it looks like F.	CHITCHAT
But if there was no age, then it would just be easy.	CHITCHAT
I'm confused.	CHITCHAT
OK, well imagine it's like what do you do like what or do you do what?	CHITCHAT
I say what?	CHITCHAT
Play WUT?	CHITCHAT
Written.	CHITCHAT
That's it.	CHITCHAT
You cracked my Riddle.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's a kind of delay from what we say.	CHITCHAT
So I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it was my settled gas that sounded plus.	CHITCHAT
I said we've got.	CHITCHAT
OK, let me catch up on chat 'cause it's.	CHITCHAT
You're obsessed.	CHITCHAT
I just really want to pronounce it for.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says this is taking me back to attempting to learn Esperanto days.	CHITCHAT
But I say that right?	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says Lol.	CHITCHAT
I'm using the symmetry tool in that.	O
Oh nice symmetry tool.	O
Show us how it's done when it works for you.	O
Jealous and then Thomas says that the discord link is not loving me.	CHITCHAT
It says it's expired.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what goes on with that.	CHITCHAT
'cause I have made a discord for the group that I'm art directing right now, an I feel like, well, one of them was having a hard time and they said it was expired and they just kept on clicking it and then eventually it worked.	CHITCHAT
Hello, brute force.	CHITCHAT
Kendall says just keep trying.	CHITCHAT
I think Anna forgot to select that never expire link option.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's a good one.	CHITCHAT
I can fix that after.	CHITCHAT
To have it now.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
How do I do it?	CHITCHAT

Let me know if that works 'cause I wanted to work.	CHITCHAT
OK, and we're back in high and then we've got Kindles.	CHITCHAT

Thank you so much for letting us know that it was giving you guff and.	CHITCHAT
Hi McKenna, I wanted to say hi.	CHITCHAT
Haven't said hi to you yet.	CHITCHAT
OK, so it's like green saying that E sound from FF.	CHITCHAT
So just.	CHITCHAT
And then you stop.	CHITCHAT
Is it just a quicker way of saying, yeah, it's like not?	CHITCHAT

Have to really take care.	CHITCHAT
No continue.	CHITCHAT

So says Esperanto was an attempt to make a universal language that wasn't English.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Now bees finally joining the shadow power into 10 into that now was genuinely sad about missing the other stream.	CHITCHAT
and I don't feel bad.	CHITCHAT
OK, if you Mrs Dream, do not feel bad.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, Anthony, you're you're the problem.	CHITCHAT
How dare you?	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the street.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, thank you for being here now.	CHITCHAT
You're amazing and never feel bad.	CHITCHAT
Anthony's just guilt tripping 'cause he's a horrible person, just horrible.	CHITCHAT
Why did I bring you on?	CHITCHAT
What is this?	CHITCHAT
Windows says it was supposed to be a really easy to learn.	CHITCHAT
Oh, really see that would be great.	CHITCHAT
It makes a lot of sense to make a universal language, so it's extremely easy to learn 'cause every single language seems to be a different varying level of hardness.	CHITCHAT
And then of course, English is like one of the most widely spread languages and it's got so much confusing stuff about it like.	CHITCHAT
So many exceptions, I'm very glad that we learned it as a first language, 'cause I don't know if I have the energy.	CHITCHAT
So learn it as a second language, but some people don't have the choice of like what they have to learn when they move somewhere or whatever.	CHITCHAT
So um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, very grateful to have learned English already, but I want to learn more languages.	CHITCHAT
We've talked about this before, but it's like bucket list item for sure.	CHITCHAT
And I'm in the chat saying see it works.	CHITCHAT
I'm assuming towards the discord link.	CHITCHAT
Glad discord.	CHITCHAT
And we've got McGinn in the chat, saying I was busy all week so I couldn't join the streams.	CHITCHAT
Now his guilt tripping.	CHITCHAT
Just said oh McKenna, while shaking my head disappointingly, it's fine.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, we're always gonna be here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be doing different things.	CHITCHAT
And also there are always replays on my page Anthony recommends listening to them at two times speeds and that you can hear my left in very high pitch and is a little bit faster so you don't have to worry about.	CHITCHAT
You know when we spend an hour trying to figure out how to pronounce somebody's name.	CHITCHAT
To be continued.	CHITCHAT
You don't like negative 5 speed and be like is that I don't know if that's an option.	CHITCHAT
I don't think that's real.	CHITCHAT
I wish it was.	CHITCHAT
Leave it to be slower, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how to do it without it being slower.	CHITCHAT
But look at this bad Ono, you can know you can play it slower, yeah?	CHITCHAT
Fun.	CHITCHAT
Then So we've got um Kindle in the chat saying, it's reminding me also of how to pronounce Sharon.	CHITCHAT

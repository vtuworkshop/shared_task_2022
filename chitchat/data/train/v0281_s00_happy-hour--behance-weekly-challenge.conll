There is a a weekly challenge started by one and only Ryan Salvi here in the chat.	CHITCHAT
So everyone say hi to Ryan.	CHITCHAT
He's proposed an idea for the streamers to do a weekly challenge.	CHITCHAT

I think Ryan actually kind of inspired Maine.	CHITCHAT
I know like the Quarantine Award I guess would be awarded to the person in quarantine, but.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking after seeing you post a picture of you with the fresh cake mask looking good, you've got like a lion's mane going on top your head.	O
So I think we're gonna do a doodle of a character with some crazy out-of-control long super wild hair.	O

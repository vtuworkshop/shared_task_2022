We're kind of going back to like the old way of the old illustrations.	O

So if you've been following my work, you know that there's been a progression overtime where I started out drawing just basically portraits like just funny goofy cartoon heads are very like 90s inspired, and that's advanced into like full body characters.	O
Now we're doing more scenes, doing wider images that were to go back to the basics.	O
A square with like a lot of hair and ahead.	O
So that's what we're doing tonight.	O
Here I'm telling you man, seriously, you have a line main like and your hair is kind of like more of like a you know.	O

If you got a few out there few feelers and there's a few, there's a few hopefuls for some stuff so maybe you'll see something on a can.	O

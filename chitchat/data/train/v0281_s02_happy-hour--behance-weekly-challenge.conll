Alright, well.	CHITCHAT
Fresh KK has not.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just listen to my smooth voice as I eat this.	CHITCHAT
I don't know as I drink this beer.	CHITCHAT
I'll just as I eat this potato but I didn't have like something around that look like a potato like baby.	CHITCHAT
Anyone here watch Brooklyn 99.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
If so, there's an episode where Andy Samberg.	CHITCHAT
To go undercover pretends he's ASM are video like star and he doesn't talk past this.	CHITCHAT
Really funny, I love that show she was great.	CHITCHAT
Anthony must be lag time beer.	CHITCHAT

It's having an effect of my mission now is definitely my stream.	CHITCHAT
You're fine, keep drinking.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so again, weekly challenges.	CHITCHAT

Andy Quarantine Award that he gets is.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Best haircut.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
As far as the soothing sounds of sipping cider?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's just Maine.	CHITCHAT
Like here, this is what you get.	CHITCHAT
It went down the wrong way, sorry.	CHITCHAT
Josh.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
I want to compensate the work over, but I think that would not be a funny joke, so I might do that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's give this guy some crazy hairdo.	O
Seems like things are kind of caught up and working now.	O
Uh-huh That slurping, not something.	CHITCHAT
Oh I'm sorry old.	CHITCHAT
Are they right?	CHITCHAT
Something like I wish I had a screw like.	CHITCHAT
That's the thing.	CHITCHAT
I take it Anthony is yours.	CHITCHAT
That's a.	CHITCHAT
This could be one of those moments that, like oddly comes back to like going to find another stream or somewhere that's going to have that like clip.	CHITCHAT
Will get you right.	CHITCHAT
We find that elsewhere watch fresh cage said beer.	CHITCHAT
Right so.	CHITCHAT
Now I was going to get this person like crazy long hair, but I feel like we have been quarantined enough to have your hair grow out to the point where it's like down to your butt so.	O
This person is just going to have like crazy.	O
I don't know like fluffy hair.	O
And you know what?	CHITCHAT
Maybe will give him a beer?	O
Why not like?	CHITCHAT
How's everybody doing with like Corentin stuff right now?	CHITCHAT
I know there's some places that are starting to open up.	CHITCHAT
Some places are going back on hold.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I used to ask quite a bit how everyone's doing with everyone is holding up, but I kinda stop doing that 'cause I feel like people don't want to be reminded that there're stuck inside all the time.	CHITCHAT
But now I would remind you so, why not?	CHITCHAT
Oh, you haven't seen some of the people in New Hampshire?	CHITCHAT
I think I have Heather, my mom's from New Hampshire, and she has a beard so you know.	CHITCHAT
And I want to move out that way.	CHITCHAT
Automotive Vermont.	CHITCHAT
That's why I want to move to.	CHITCHAT
Think I should run the mouth and 1st.	O
Sideburns, yeah yeah, they have nothing to fix eyebrows going.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so again this is happy hour.	CHITCHAT
It is a 60 minute stream where I draw for 60 minutes, but I'm getting a little bit of the pot 'cause I always do that every time, so why not?	CHITCHAT
But this time is probably going to be more like our 15 just because I took some time to like.	CHITCHAT
Stop down and try to figure out what's going on my computer, but it seems like I don't see, although like crazy lag and stuff right now my side, so I hope you're doing better.	CHITCHAT
Slowly opening up in Colorado, the santero Dan.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry I don't have more mass for you man.	CHITCHAT
You were asking about that in the discord, and if you are new to the stream and you want to know what I'm talking about, check out the links below down in the description talks about the tools I'm using.	CHITCHAT

Late night with fresh cakes where I do a more aggressive illustration usually.	CHITCHAT
Jump on my iPad, do a more aggressive illustration usually, and it's a lot of fun, right?	CHITCHAT
So I want to get rid of this lip.	O
And the reason being is because we're going to do a couple of different things.	O
Here we go into that dot.	O
I don't need to be there.	O
Oh what's up, Jack?	CHITCHAT
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Miss most live stream today?	CHITCHAT
Oops, that's alright, don't worry about it.	CHITCHAT
So when you eat a lot of food on camera, basically that's what nothing is.	CHITCHAT
OK, they say that right?	CHITCHAT
Feel like this has really suggestive.	CHITCHAT
You could, yeah.	CHITCHAT
I mean now it's art right?	CHITCHAT
Like if you eat a lot of food.	CHITCHAT
Like when you say a lot of food like what's a lot?	CHITCHAT
'cause like.	CHITCHAT
Like like a whole pint of Ben and Jerry's kind of a lot or like.	CHITCHAT
Thanksgiving dinner a lot.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so here's one I want to clean up a few things.	O
Going to merge these layers down and I'm going to grab him real quick and I want to bring this mouth up a little higher 'cause it's looking kind of not right.	O
So we're going to grab our selection tool.	O
We're just going to select the mouth and going to grab transform.	O
Or to bump it up kind of rotate it.	O
Deselect, we're going to go back to our head layer loops and grab two of 'em.	O
Grab our brush or just going to get rid of some stuff.	O
We're going to do some lines.	O
Come back on a rough sketch just so we can see so so we can see we're going alright.	O
Start off pressure, velocity, dynamics and let's turn our brush size up and we're just going on this one extra layer.	O
We're just going to kind of draw.	O
Let's turn that way up.	O
Nope, gotta go to like.	CHITCHAT
15 maybe.	O
Yeah, there we go.	CHITCHAT
That's a good thickness alright.	O
Start dropping these guys in.	O
No, like Thanksgiving dinner.	O
Usually for some of them.	O
OK, that's.	CHITCHAT
Move on, I said that way wrong move bombing that sounds way forward, OK?	O
Is it like a?	CHITCHAT
Can I get a region of origin or whatever it is where they ask for in the spelling bee all the time?	O
Alright, let's let's merge much stuff together and then we're going to add in our detail for the scruff.	O
Maybe will give an actual stash that could be kind of cool.	O
There were certain colors and some other details and Polish this character up.	O
About 20 minutes left little more pull over.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's what that corn Tina Ward is.	CHITCHAT
Sorry Heather, um seems like they're trying to figure out what that is.	CHITCHAT
Yes, there is a new stream thing started called.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be a weekly challenge.	CHITCHAT
Today's is the Quarantine Award, so we're going to draw all the character that one.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Best haircut during quarantine and it's just going to be a whole lot of not, you know, I don't know.	O
A whole lot of her basically just ungroomed.	O
That's what we're going for, what we're doing right now, and ungroomed character.	O
Which is like most of my character so.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT

Now everyone's like thoroughly convinced.	CHITCHAT
Now go into your stream sharing and do like who's your beard, where to go.	O
You need to buy one of those like those hats that have the beard now.	O
And just like where it on your next dream, be hilarious.	O
Or is the liar that's cool too?	CHITCHAT
Just digitally removed.	CHITCHAT
Like Superman's mustache.	O
Now Super Randallstown mustache.	O
He's a good guy and everyone knows villains have facial hair.	O
Why facial hair?	O
I wanna be building.	CHITCHAT
That's a real, so that's like a real thing.	CHITCHAT
I watched a really cool little interview with like Stanley back when he was around and.	CHITCHAT
And Jim Lee.	CHITCHAT
And they were talking about.	CHITCHAT
Character creation and stuff like that in the Marvel universe and generally made the comment that villains have facial hair and heroes do not.	CHITCHAT
Because it's easier to make someone like look evil with a goatee than it is to make someone look good.	CHITCHAT
Although Doctor Strange somehow rocks, a very nice goatee, so you know.	CHITCHAT
That theory is out the window right out of the gate.	CHITCHAT
We got left on time.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we got about 10 minutes left so I'm going to finish up some detail, add some color.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to get into shading on this one, but that's all good.	CHITCHAT
Well, you know the Harris took a little longer than expected.	CHITCHAT
Well, I do have a couple extra minutes 'cause I spent some time in the beginning trying to mess around my settings so that the stream wasn't all laggy and stupid.	CHITCHAT
So maybe will.	CHITCHAT
This cool to see how far we get will go to an hour 15.	CHITCHAT
IG filter I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Dude, you should man Nate.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
Has anyone played around with that stuff yet?	CHITCHAT
Like any other designers that are in the chat with anyone?	CHITCHAT
Explored like what was it called was Facebook thing.	CHITCHAT
Spark or something?	CHITCHAT
I don't know what it's called.	CHITCHAT
Or is that that's?	CHITCHAT
That's adobes Like Social?	CHITCHAT
Thing.	CHITCHAT
Let's give this guy some stash hairs, but again, they're not going to be.	O
It's not gonna have a good stash.	O
I don't know if it was like stash years, they just like detail.	O
Maybe give mustache?	O
Will that look like?	CHITCHAT
This is the Super rough stash, just to see if it works.	O
Now it just looks like he's nodding everywhere.	O
Let's put some blemishes.	O
Why not right?	CHITCHAT
Every time I do something that moves, that's weird.	CHITCHAT
Those filters work wonders, Dan says Adobe Arrowbear.	CHITCHAT

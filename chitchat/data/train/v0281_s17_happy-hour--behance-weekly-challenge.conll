I'm waiting for something.	CHITCHAT
Stylized front oh Silas crowd.	CHITCHAT
I just threw my pen so far away.	CHITCHAT
Can I get to it?	CHITCHAT
Oh boy oh boy.	CHITCHAT
There it is I was waiting for the day that would happen.	CHITCHAT

You have celebrating.	CHITCHAT
I'm fine with that.	CHITCHAT
Uh, let's see here, let's do.	CHITCHAT

Or think everybody for watching tonight.	CHITCHAT
I hope you all really enjoy.	CHITCHAT
This illustration is really fun to do again.	CHITCHAT
There was a prompt up in the in the upper left corner.	CHITCHAT
It says Quarantine Awards, so that might be a little small.	CHITCHAT
If you're watching the viewfinder to see what it fully is, but there are now going to be weekly challenges for the hand streamers.	CHITCHAT
This weeks was the Quarantine Award, so I created a character that would presumably win best Hygiene Award.	CHITCHAT
We got junk in the teeth here.	CHITCHAT
Well, kind of junk on the teeth.	CHITCHAT
Unkempt hair poorly shave in lots of blemishes.	CHITCHAT
Do something kind of fun to do.	CHITCHAT
Classic little fresh cake illustration, so I hope you all really enjoyed watching me draw this little character here on happy hour.	CHITCHAT
This stream happens twice a week, Mondays and Wednesdays at 6:00 PM and then on Fridays is the time lapse.	CHITCHAT
If you want to know the time lapse is Fridays, I take a bunch of illustrations that I do during the week.	CHITCHAT
At some point.	CHITCHAT
Some of them are done on stream, some of them are not.	CHITCHAT
It's a few hours of streaming done in just a few minutes.	CHITCHAT
You can watch the character be created from start to finish, so this is where this illustration began and.	CHITCHAT
I always watch these down if I start to find things that I'm like, I kind of like that when I was doing that part.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, that's what the time lapses.	CHITCHAT
So some of the Superfund he's a Gold Star to show an award.	CHITCHAT
That's what Heather saying.	CHITCHAT

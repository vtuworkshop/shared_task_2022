Ready to get back to work on these guys.	O
Have been itching to do a stream with these guys for awhile but I had to take care of a client work so I haven't had a chance to work on my own thing for a bit and I'm excited to take a quick breather word on my stuff.	CHITCHAT
Before I get back to, you know.	CHITCHAT
Working for clients and whatnot, so I'm excited for that now.	CHITCHAT
Excited to get back to client work after this, but for now I really, really needed.	CHITCHAT
My own little thing here.	CHITCHAT
So what's project menace dishes, uh?	CHITCHAT
If you guys have been here before and you've seen it, this is just a personal project.	CHITCHAT
I do something called studies.	CHITCHAT
Studies are just my version of chippies from anime, manga and all that good stuff.	CHITCHAT
And essentially all it is is just a very detailed and three dimensional chippies.	CHITCHAT
That's what a study is.	CHITCHAT
But I specifically started working on this project because I am doing.	CHITCHAT
Need to wipe my glasses here.	CHITCHAT
Anti glare glasses.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I need to make a personal product because I finally got a 3D printer.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I've been printing some stuff.	CHITCHAT
It's been a lot.	CHITCHAT
It's been quite the learning curve.	CHITCHAT
There is so much out there on the Internet, but it's hard to digest all of it and really be ready for.	CHITCHAT
For all of it, you know what I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
It's it's a little.	CHITCHAT
It's a little much.	CHITCHAT
So we got as far as we could with all that and then we just jumped in and started doing it.	CHITCHAT
So it was pretty fun.	CHITCHAT
And now that I'm a little more confident in it.	CHITCHAT
Soon as I get these bad boys modeled, will start getting the.	CHITCHAT
Will start getting the them.	CHITCHAT
Pre orders for these perhaps?	CHITCHAT
Maybe a?	CHITCHAT
Maybe fun.	CHITCHAT
Do sunflowers what up to?	CHITCHAT
Hey, I can't wait to see this render well.	O
It might just be drawn out.	CHITCHAT
I don't know that it will be rendered rendered, but I'm actually looking for a tango mask.	O
For reference, really quick.	O
I'm still pretty married to the idea that it should have the wild hair all over her, but I think I think she should have.	O
Little pigtails and Whatnot.	O
So I don't know if you read in the description.	O
I was saying that, uh, this.	O
This particular character from the from the.	O
Is the third time doing I've done?	O
And again, if you guys saw the other two.	O
Uh, one was a, uh.	CHITCHAT
Fox mask And the other one was a demon mask.	O
Only mask this was going to be the Tango mask which has like this.	O
Crazy knows now.	O
The funny part is that studies don't have noses so.	O
We're breaking the rules here.	CHITCHAT
But it's all good.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
What was I say?	CHITCHAT
I completely forgot.	CHITCHAT
I just.	CHITCHAT
Totally lost my train of thought.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I'm pretty.	CHITCHAT
Married to the idea of it being like just as wild gnarly mask.	O
Like all this hair, it's all wrinkly and grows.	O
Maybe some of these wrinkles can be like swirls.	O
So these are going to be 3D printed.	O
We could take advantage.	O
Of how?	CHITCHAT
How nice it is to like, hold onto a lot of detail and what not.	O
But The idea is that I'm going to be selling.	O
Blank Prince in like a.	O
Either a Gray.	O
Gray, resin or or a black rezan.	O

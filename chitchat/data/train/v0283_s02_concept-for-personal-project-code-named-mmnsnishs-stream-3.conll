For the first batch, maybe.	O
And then eventually I'll have upgraded batches where like stuff is.	O
You know, slightly painted.	O
Or I have a batch where this might be?	O
Too much, but.	CHITCHAT
I'm kind of hoping that I'll be able to get to a point where.	O
They sell these little.	O
Leads that are that are, I think their battery powered their shape.	O
Something like this.	CHITCHAT
Like let's say if this were her head and I wanted her eyes to glow, that all I would have to do is hollow out.	O
The negative of this light and the like.	O
Let's say her face was here and this is her mouth and her eyes.	O
So I would just have to hollow it out this way so that this.	O
Will just slide in here and then.	O
Now her eyes would actually glow.	O
And I kind of have that idea for maybe doing some of that, like maybe even.	O
Like on the sword handle, the sword handle has like lights or the sort itself has lights or even on the clothing.	O
I don't know, so that's something that I'm considering for later.	O
But I might be kinda cool if I could if I could pull it off, you know?	O
But Anyway, I'm uh.	CHITCHAT
Getting ahead of myself first I need to design the first like.	CHITCHAT
Four or five.	CHITCHAT
So that I could then have something to.	CHITCHAT
To show.	CHITCHAT
OK, run one here.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Started looking into like packaging and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping I'm hoping I can make the box nice.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of templates out there that are free and I'm going to modify them to have something something nice little window.	CHITCHAT
That will, uh.	CHITCHAT
Showcase the figure.	CHITCHAT
Just enough.	CHITCHAT
And then even.	CHITCHAT
Package it with like foam.	CHITCHAT
And I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
In front of Maine was talking about maybe doing some kind of.	O
Specifically for this character too.	O
Do you like a?	CHITCHAT
Sci-fi wings.	O
I'm not 100% sold on it.	CHITCHAT
But Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Those wings that are like if it's like the figure.	O
And they have like a some kind of.	O
Circle and then.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
There's like just.	CHITCHAT
Things like this.	CHITCHAT
And they're like floating.	O
So that that might be something that I do for her, but I feel like it's a little too much.	O
I kind of for me so far.	O
The idea is that they are more like a.	O
Just people in clothing, you know?	O
Bye.	CHITCHAT
I know that, so this is going to be like wave one another for wave two.	O
I do want to have some that have like.	O
Cybernetic limbs, perhaps cybernetic limbs.	O
Like robotic limbs, that kind of thing, so might save it for that I don't know.	O
But I want to make it to wear the masks are detachable and so it would be pretty cool too.	O
To take this off and then it'll be just like this cute little.	O
Chevy Chick, that's like just all mean.	O
I think that would be fun.	CHITCHAT
I think I put.	O

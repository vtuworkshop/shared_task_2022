You got to see my island been doing work over the weekend.	CHITCHAT
So Dang I need to work on my and excited about the summer update.	CHITCHAT
I heard there was swimming on that.	CHITCHAT
About Animal Crossing right?	CHITCHAT
Is there anything else to talk about?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
So I like that that this is giving off some Majora's mask Vibes, 'cause Man Majora's mask is such a dope.	O
Such a doper Design 'cause it's just like this.	O
Not human face and it's creepy.	O
Freaking love it.	CHITCHAT
They love the game and I'm sad to see people falling off because the lack of updates but also gotta be hard to develop updates when you're on lock down after sure.	CHITCHAT
Majora's mask is fun, but stressed me out alot.	CHITCHAT
Whole game on a timer gives me such anxiety as Ferris Bueller's Day out.	CHITCHAT
Dude.	CHITCHAT
Meet a little story about my experience with Majora's mask.	CHITCHAT
So the Majora's mask came out, way, way, way back in the day, right?	CHITCHAT
And I had my N64.	CHITCHAT
And I was all about Zelda.	CHITCHAT
I'm still all about Zelda.	CHITCHAT
It's like the only game I obsess over and play all the time.	CHITCHAT
To my detriment, some would say.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but.	CHITCHAT
Love that game anyway it came out and I couldn't afford it.	CHITCHAT
So what I did was I rented it.	CHITCHAT
And that I think, uh, at the time.	CHITCHAT
At the time they had like it was either blockbuster or Hollywood video.	CHITCHAT
I can't remember.	CHITCHAT
I think is blockbuster.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, way back.	CHITCHAT
They had like the where you could rent something for three nights and it was cheaper or like for the weekend and it was cheaper and all that.	CHITCHAT
So I had.	CHITCHAT
I think I had rented it for for the weekend.	CHITCHAT
And it was three days.	CHITCHAT
And so, like my goal was to try to beat the game in those three days.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like in the game, which is to be in two days.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And so I played that game crazy.	CHITCHAT
I was very close to beating it up.	CHITCHAT
And then, like my time was coming to an end, right?	CHITCHAT
Like my rental.	CHITCHAT
So I was like, Oh Man, I guess I'm not going to be able to finish it now is all sad.	CHITCHAT
But I was like, yeah, whatever.	CHITCHAT
So I deleted my game profile because I was like I'm not going to.	CHITCHAT
Like I'm not going to send this back.	CHITCHAT
So I'm not going to send this back and somebody else has my progress and then they get to just play my game.	CHITCHAT
You know, like forget that noise.	CHITCHAT
I'm deleting it so I delete the sucker.	CHITCHAT
And I realize that I still had the game for another day.	CHITCHAT
So I just deleted my own game profile way before I should have and I was so devastated that I never want to play that game again in my life like I never rented it again.	CHITCHAT
Never bought it when I had the chance I was like, Nope.	CHITCHAT
Forget this game forever because of my stupid mistake like I am.	CHITCHAT
Mad at it, even though it's not in.	CHITCHAT
Not.	CHITCHAT
Anybody's fault but my own.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I was super bummed out about that, but Majora's mask was so good, and I could have beaten it, I I had.	CHITCHAT

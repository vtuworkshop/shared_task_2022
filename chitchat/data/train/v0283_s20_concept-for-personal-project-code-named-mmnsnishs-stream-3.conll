I'm doing great.	CHITCHAT
What about you?	CHITCHAT
I am doing excellent Nicholas.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing excellent man.	CHITCHAT
I've been itching and hurting.	CHITCHAT
Work on these concepts that you see here since you're just joining.	CHITCHAT
I hope you don't mind.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to repeat a little bit of what I was saying earlier.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, this is, uh?	CHITCHAT
This is a little project of mine.	CHITCHAT
That is code name meniscus.	CHITCHAT
And I will not be revealing what that means for a little while.	CHITCHAT
It's just something silly.	CHITCHAT
But this is a personal project of mine.	CHITCHAT
Uh, if you looked in my Gallery.	CHITCHAT
If you had a chance to look at it, you'll see something.	CHITCHAT
No, I only have two or three projects posted, but you'll see one called studies.	CHITCHAT
And studies are just my version of Chivvies 'cause I love Chevys and anime and manga all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
And there just my version there.	CHITCHAT
Just way more.	CHITCHAT
Detailed than Chevys normally are more dimension to them.	CHITCHAT
A lot more.	CHITCHAT
Really, if you will.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, I got a 3D printer and I wanted to make my studies as.	CHITCHAT
An actual.	CHITCHAT
3 dimensional product.	CHITCHAT
So I started designing.	CHITCHAT
I started designing my own.	CHITCHAT
Version of 'em are my own original studies were there.	CHITCHAT
Just something that I can print out without worrying about.	CHITCHAT
Like you know, it's fan art, so it's in that Gray area.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Instead, this is going to be fully just just me.	CHITCHAT
You get me.	CHITCHAT
In My Portfolio, yeah here I might be hands profile.	CHITCHAT
Um, there's only I think 3 projects that I put up or two and one of 'em is studies.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so anyway this is just a this is my own.	CHITCHAT
These are my original study specifically for this project where I'm going to have them 3D printed for people to paint on their own if they want to.	CHITCHAT
Going to have little trading cards and like I'm sort of developing a story not not really just.	CHITCHAT
Very, very rudimentary about the story anyway, but it's just kind of this idea of like a post apocalyptic world.	CHITCHAT
It's not very original, it'll just hopefully visually be a little bit different than what most people are seeing, but it just post apocalyptic world.	CHITCHAT
There are a bunch of gangs.	CHITCHAT
And I guess they're fighting each other, so the first batch that I started doing 'cause I had seen this one sketch.	CHITCHAT
Um by two cents lists.	CHITCHAT
Whom if you don't know who that is, he should follow hers does great work.	CHITCHAT
She streams on here.	CHITCHAT
I'll see if I can add her.	CHITCHAT
Social media stuff.	CHITCHAT
Here in a sack, but she did a sketch in an in my head.	CHITCHAT
I saw Anohni mask like little only mask.	CHITCHAT
And all Japanese only mask into and I was like to a quick screen grab of it and then I designed this little.	CHITCHAT
You know me.	CHITCHAT
Oh futuristic samurai cyber punk.	CHITCHAT
That everybody does.	CHITCHAT
I did just a really quick one and I was like Oh Man, I really like that.	CHITCHAT
And then I was like kind of want to do one with the Fox mask now.	CHITCHAT
And as soon as I thought of that also in a tangle, which is this one?	CHITCHAT
And so this is like a month ago already.	CHITCHAT
So is it was awhile ago.	CHITCHAT
I just haven't been able to work on it that much.	CHITCHAT
I think I did too.	CHITCHAT
2 lives on this.	CHITCHAT
Before you could see the playbacks on those.	CHITCHAT
But that's kind of how it started in the idea, I guess is that there.	CHITCHAT
Like little gang members and their the whole, the whole stick is that they all wear.	CHITCHAT
A cultural type mask.	CHITCHAT
Select the first gang that I'm working on is all Japanese inspired.	CHITCHAT
The next I'm going to be working on his here, here in a another like 20 minutes or so.	CHITCHAT

Should we rework some of this?	O
Edge flow here.	O
If you peel those left button divides are going to go way down.	O
Could be that face Cam.	CHITCHAT
Hi Craig, I know I've been kind of quiet.	CHITCHAT
The audio is she on yourself so.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK, so So what are you working on right now exactly?	CHITCHAT
Working on trying to get the edge for a little bit better.	O
Right now you're still doubled, though I don't know if you come through.	O
Skype as well.	O
Is that better?	CHITCHAT
There you go, yeah?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, I'm just trying to.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I just want to get get the edges down so that we can work on the.	O
The main structure without adding too much detail first, so we want to kind of workout and.	O
Get the output shape and then we start refining and adding a secondary details.	O
OK yeah, I uhm were still kind of figuring out the body portion 'cause they thought idea was arms and stuff, right?	O
That was kind of the idea, Yeah, but I mean it's all subjective change.	O
Yeah yeah yeah, uhm, but it's like right now.	O
I like it, I just I feel like.	O
It's it's missing something, you know, I don't.	O
I don't know why, but it's it's missing that, you know.	O
Beatrice alone funeral uhm.	O
I'm actually going to pull up.	O
I was doing some.	O
Some practice pieces on yesterday or the day before and I will show you.	O
Yeah, it was like.	O
This hard surface practice so.	O
Let's see, we pull those up and then we can kind of look for.	O
I don't know kind of details that we might be interested in.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Here we go, so it's just like a little webcam.	O
And I thought it's kind of appropriate.	O
We're doing a little robot that has a camera so.	O
Something fancy, but like we got these little.	O
I don't know this little layered effect.	O
It could be kind of cool to give it almost like a telescoping book.	O
Oh, I love that idea.	CHITCHAT
May that's so good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I just kind of like made like an indent.	O
I like to know who's doing.	CHITCHAT
That's way cooler, so I like that a lot.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, yeah, stuff like that and then this one really doesn't have that much detail.	O
Actually, this is like a.	CHITCHAT
A quick like I don't know our builds.	CHITCHAT
You're so so.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, just getting stuff like I don't know.	O
It's got some interesting shapes in it.	O
We get like this.	CHITCHAT
I don't know even what you'd call this, but you get a little bit here.	O
No, I kinda like the yeah yeah.	CHITCHAT
Make it.	CHITCHAT
And then yeah, down here this piece.	O
I kind of like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know in densities look really good.	O
The way they're kind of tapered in.	O
You're better than that.	O
Those kind of looks I want to.	O
I want to bring that kind of stuff.	O
Going to the drug so.	O
But yeah, that's right, you can try out the.	O
That layered effect, yeah.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Wanna play play with some pretty garish colors here to kind of sketch out some ideas.	O
My eyes are broken so like what do you think in terms of the direction of like the the rest of the body like?	O
How should that go?	CHITCHAT
Should be more boxy or do you think it should be?	O
More rounded he can try working.	O
Some curves in um.	O
But I still think we want to keep that kind of angular lookin.	O
But I mean we can like it's.	O
It's not going to be boxy the whole way through.	O
Like once we start getting our supportive edges and then it should be really easy to start a building up.	O
A few curves that kind of smooth things out.	O
The thing is, is like I kind of liked the I.	O
I like didn't love the body but I like didn't hate the other body that we made Excel VHS.	O

I like that too.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you just have the arms coming down yeah other those kind of cool yeah.	O
So we'll try doing that and see if I like it or not.	O
'cause this is.	CHITCHAT
I mean, this is a pretty odd angle, and actually I should just get rid of this stuff too.	O
I don't know if we're doing ball socket joints or anything like that.	O
I'll put it back ground well.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, yeah, I'll try drawing.	CHITCHAT
She had.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
So I guess.	CHITCHAT
Before I start telescope in this bad boy and how do we feel about the?	O
The overall shape of the frontier, the silhouette of it.	O
I just want to like have you and the design on the screen at the same time so I'm not make some things out.	O
I don't know if that means anything.	O
Outside or not, but try to.	O
I'm doing all sorts of bad things right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm like the OS for Mac is just I'm just a little not smart.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I feel like.	CHITCHAT
It's like kind of there, but it's not I don't know.	O
Need something a little bit more right?	O
Like this, I'd like like.	O
Something about looking on it head on.	O
Yeah, I feel like it's like.	O
It's pretty squad, you know what?	CHITCHAT
It might not be squad enough.	CHITCHAT
I think that might be it.	CHITCHAT
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
'cause I feel like?	CHITCHAT
Like it kind of feels like if you took the original hexagon shape right and then like cut apart of it like before, it goes back into that paper thing.	O
So like we have the two edges on the side then we have the taper.	O
If you cutoff right before the paper and then you stick the head on and make it longer.	O
Kind of so it's like.	CHITCHAT
I know it would be.	CHITCHAT
It would be like.	CHITCHAT
Most why I'm not particularly he would draw draw the shape out.	O
It only is that the recovery room.	O
Hey Joey, yet we're gonna early stream today.	CHITCHAT
I prefer their exchange personally.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I get tired at night and then just ramble or don't say anything at all.	CHITCHAT
I'm not a ruler, so please don't get too mad at how badly straight lines are.	CHITCHAT
So going for the robot yet?	CHITCHAT
It's a little more work on it today.	CHITCHAT
And practicing the hard surface stuff.	CHITCHAT
It kind of has like a big hat.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's like a big old hat.	CHITCHAT
That kind of.	CHITCHAT
You know, so it's like.	O
I I feel like, at least when I I drew it, I was thinking like this is coming out pretty far.	O
You know, OK then.	O
I mean, each looks like shadow.	O
We need this is all too far.	O
And you know, again, if you have any ideas while I'm doodling this, like I mean, if you've got any new ideas or.	O
Better ways to convey things.	CHITCHAT
I'm years 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I mean I'm doing sci-fi stuff.	CHITCHAT
I think says it uses like your fault so.	CHITCHAT
Let's take partial responsibility for that.	CHITCHAT
The partial this possibility.	CHITCHAT
I like did not warm up today really, probably should.	CHITCHAT
OK, so having.	CHITCHAT
OK, actually that would be that.	CHITCHAT
Make things a lot easier.	CHITCHAT
Having that kind of gap between the main body like the shielding on top.	O
Yeah Yeah.	CHITCHAT
'cause I kinda wanted like a little bit of overhang out.	O
I think you can even see that like right here a little bit, you know?	O
Yeah, it's not like completely connected.	O
I like that, yeah.	CHITCHAT

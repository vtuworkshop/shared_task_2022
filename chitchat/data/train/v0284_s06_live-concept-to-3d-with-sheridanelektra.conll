Is symmetry is broken?	CHITCHAT
It's always fun.	CHITCHAT
Where we gonna go put those wires now and love vent.	CHITCHAT
I guess we could still put the movies up with about the side maybe.	CHITCHAT
Like right here?	CHITCHAT
What do you think like?	CHITCHAT
Right underneath I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Figure it out.	CHITCHAT
Negating.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I was talking with.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
Someone in basically they were saying that at least with like.	CHITCHAT
What days notice with like Star Wars like aren't arms like any particular that they kind of are like more organic where they like to come in and then come out again?	CHITCHAT
You know I don't know if that makes any sense but they like they don't go the opposite way basically like.	CHITCHAT
Will animal legs are like I don't think of?	CHITCHAT
The dogs leg or something you know great.	CHITCHAT
That a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But I'm not sure why.	CHITCHAT
Something With you for this body if you kind of have been stumped on this for.	CHITCHAT
I'm not feeling since last last.	CHITCHAT
Sure, do this.	CHITCHAT
At the time.	CHITCHAT
Like the bottom part of the body.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, with this portion I just.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it might just be.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Someone like articulate myself, I feel like.	CHITCHAT
If this was like if we're going to put things like less than a video game which were not, you know this is just having fun stuff, but I'm trying to think of like what would you see and I feel like, um, having these like big Inter kit.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I've seen a lot more simpler robots when when you when you play video games like that and I'm just not sure.	CHITCHAT
How complicated I want to make.	CHITCHAT
This because it's also I feel like when you make when you start like making things a little bit more complicated does take things away from the design, but I feel like there's something missing.	CHITCHAT
I just don't.	CHITCHAT
No what?	CHITCHAT
So like in this like.	CHITCHAT
Kinda just stuck.	CHITCHAT
We can't just go crazy with the amount of detail and tone it back if it feels too much or even vice versa like.	CHITCHAT
Nothing's really set in stone, as we modeled herself.	CHITCHAT
I know I just.	CHITCHAT
I know, I think.	CHITCHAT
I think by itself it looks too much like a security camera for it to like.	CHITCHAT
Stay like this, but I think with the other body design I feel like.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if I.	CHITCHAT
Love it.	CHITCHAT
And so I'm just not sure.	CHITCHAT
Exactly where to go on it.	CHITCHAT
I gotta be careful about watching you work.	CHITCHAT

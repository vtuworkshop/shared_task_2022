Something wrong here?	CHITCHAT
I don't know what it is.	CHITCHAT
Could look at your.	CHITCHAT
Which sketch OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, so you kind of have it.	CHITCHAT
Straight at the top.	O
Playing around with the idea of like also angling this house so I was like literally just playing around with that kind of thinking that maybe on the inside we have like an angled kind of like a.	O
Devil is a inlay.	O
What was the thing with a webcam?	CHITCHAT
Remember, oh, like that, uh?	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Yes, you mean but.	CHITCHAT
It'll work better, yeah?	CHITCHAT
Bevel the insect.	O
It's not any of those things work.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So I'm thinking like maybe do something like that.	CHITCHAT
But then I was.	CHITCHAT
But what do you thinking 'cause it could go?	CHITCHAT
Either way you know?	CHITCHAT
I'm just.	CHITCHAT
Person I'm didia guy, you know.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like the straight, personally, um.	CHITCHAT
But I could like.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I was originally what I had in mind, but the sketch businesses like straight up and down.	CHITCHAT
Here you see?	CHITCHAT
But I don't know what you think.	CHITCHAT
Well, I kinda have that here on the 3DS.	CHITCHAT
So I feel like Billy.	CHITCHAT
Well, I feel dumb.	CHITCHAT
Not I think the gaps find in terms of like where it's placed, but I think the actual it is I think it's a little too far down, you know, like where it comes like.	O
Here's the angle.	CHITCHAT
Here's This this to side angles and.	O
I think I should be lightly.	O
It's not gonna be all the way down to here.	O
It's going to be a little bit over, OK.	O
Yeah, yes.	CHITCHAT
And I also think like the thickness, it needs to be a little bit more, uh, we gotta give it two seats instead of a single.	O
Yeah, I got you.	CHITCHAT
I got you.	CHITCHAT
I can add that extra see, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'll work on that thing.	CHITCHAT
Should pick any begin.	CHITCHAT
Let the.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
This is.	CHITCHAT
Let the sickening color.	CHITCHAT
Say again.	CHITCHAT
So step one, bring this up a little, right?	O
Yeah, so a wee bit.	CHITCHAT
But how we feel?	CHITCHAT
So you may want to bring up side up to.	O
Also Hello Oh man.	CHITCHAT
LA.	CHITCHAT

Audio I I, that's what I would have said too so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know how any other way to.	CHITCHAT
Pronounce that alright.	CHITCHAT
So I brought that up a bit.	O
What about the angle to be a shorter?	O
This whole where where you can you show me with your cursor for your yeah let me hire it displaces.	O
OK with.	CHITCHAT
You look at it from straight on that.	CHITCHAT
I'm.	CHITCHAT
What angle is that?	O
Do you have?	CHITCHAT
Can you like break out your just getting uhm?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
That's, uh, doing CAD.	CHITCHAT
You could get measurements for every angle, every length.	CHITCHAT
It was amazing and I kind of wish they had that of this, but.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking like I don't know if it does this look like a higher angle 'cause what it looks like to me.	O
Yours is a little bit more like of adapt downwards angle.	O
Does that make sense for like for the.	O
The sketchy I did I think I did a little bit more of A.	O
Yeah, if you study, did you just send me a little?	O
Snippet of data.	O
Of that Laying up in the background and see how it lines up.	O

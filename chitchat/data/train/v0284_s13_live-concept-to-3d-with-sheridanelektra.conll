No, I gave you all that crap about the old.	CHITCHAT
Aerodynamic thin, but I'm pretty sure boat rudders or the other way around, so it's totally valid.	O
I mean, I I legitimately, I mean it's gonna be like a floating.	O
Robot, so it's like aerodynamics makes sense.	O
This isn't going into, but if it's gonna if it like, Oh, but if we had the thin turn and that's how it steers.	O
Then it would be the other way and that could be kinda dope.	O
See what I'm saying.	CHITCHAT

She turn maybe I don't know.	O
Like if it could turn like that as it applies.	O

It was so good.	CHITCHAT
So so good.	CHITCHAT
Not show person.	CHITCHAT
It's really hard for me to like.	CHITCHAT
Sit down and like watch stuff so it was really.	CHITCHAT
It was really fun.	CHITCHAT
Get back into the.	CHITCHAT
To Atlanta Reinvigorate my love for it.	CHITCHAT
It needs so bad.	CHITCHAT
Are you trying to merge all the pieces together?	O
Connected Cemetery things flatten the way it needs to be.	O
Adding some loops here so that it can.	O
Welded together I wanna see 3D modeling.	O
You could teach it.	O
It ain't that hard.	CHITCHAT
Sensitized in doing it for several years.	CHITCHAT
It's only been like 3.	CHITCHAT
I could show you something I did in the first year.	CHITCHAT
Under 5.	CHITCHAT
I would love to see something that you created.	CHITCHAT
Do you?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm not gonna ask it.	CHITCHAT
I you already said it.	CHITCHAT
You thought I did pretty well with the Z friendships.	CHITCHAT
I'm good with like the actual like I feel like posting part, but when it comes to like I think the faces and like making everything look.	CHITCHAT
Places I think are the hardest thing to do though 'cause.	CHITCHAT
That's one of those things that when it's off like we're just programmed to immediately know.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't know if you remember that that one lady I showed you like the my very first models like there's so many looking at it the other day and it's like even just like watching like your your stuff too.	CHITCHAT
It's like this is rough dude like I think I get it.	CHITCHAT
I get it.	CHITCHAT
You've been doing it a lot longer but I was just like shocked because I remember I was like so proud of it and then.	CHITCHAT
It's all 2020.	CHITCHAT
This looks so bad, but this is one semester of learning to 3D model.	CHITCHAT
M and teaching myself textures and.	CHITCHAT
It hurts to look at.	CHITCHAT
This stage is terrible.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
Then you definitely make some cool stuff now for sure like this was.	CHITCHAT
This is one semester, mind you.	CHITCHAT
So you know what?	CHITCHAT
And what I can do like actually?	CHITCHAT
So it wasn't good.	CHITCHAT
But like I said.	CHITCHAT
I think it's I don't think it's bad.	CHITCHAT
Again, it's better than what I could do so.	CHITCHAT
Remember how long its mysteries but.	CHITCHAT
Europe.	CHITCHAT
Once is it Ford said happy year.	CHITCHAT
I think it depends, but I mean, at least for for my college it's like three to four months.	CHITCHAT
And you know it.	CHITCHAT
Three months are too bad.	CHITCHAT
Not the worst.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's fine.	CHITCHAT
Giving yourself a hard time.	CHITCHAT
Come on tonight.	CHITCHAT
But to be fair.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't say this lightly.	CHITCHAT
Now you said.	CHITCHAT
Still say I was missing.	CHITCHAT
Well, it it's too.	CHITCHAT
It's too braggadocious though I can also there's another big big round.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there you go.	CHITCHAT
You can do it.	CHITCHAT
Testing the class OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, yeah yeah, I know I already know it's like the only time I was ever good at at anything in a school.	CHITCHAT
Though I'm not even though I'm not even my.	CHITCHAT

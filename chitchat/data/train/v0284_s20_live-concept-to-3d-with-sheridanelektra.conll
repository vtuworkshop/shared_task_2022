I was terrible at everything and then it was like I finally did this in like Oh, I'm actually like people are coming to me for help.	CHITCHAT
I was so happy.	CHITCHAT
Awesome me.	CHITCHAT
Why I'd like it?	CHITCHAT
It's OK to brag.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
I think you know.	CHITCHAT
It depends on the context, but you're not like you're not like well.	CHITCHAT
Class and you know, just I don't know.	CHITCHAT
You're not saying I'd like to think that's out of character for me, but yeah, you pretty much.	CHITCHAT
But I'm saying that I'm like I said I'm humbled and it's instantly not humble.	CHITCHAT
Though, you know that's the problem.	CHITCHAT
That would set.	CHITCHAT
Hey, can you learn you start telling everyone that I'm humble?	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, if he had to do that though I was.	CHITCHAT
But man, you must really not be humble.	CHITCHAT
If you're paying people to tell you, but you're humble.	CHITCHAT
Funny.	CHITCHAT
Joey said they should have or the Rings characters despite all my goodness that be.	CHITCHAT
They pay for it so quick.	CHITCHAT
I'd be just happy if they made another good Lord of the Rings game, you know.	CHITCHAT
Anything was Pippin?	CHITCHAT
I'm down.	CHITCHAT
I think we finally have it.	CHITCHAT
One solid piece.	CHITCHAT
We just have to workout if you how do you say that word?	CHITCHAT
So I don't think I've ever seen that word self effacing.	CHITCHAT
Gotta be a facing right?	CHITCHAT
Self of facing her lunch, not claiming attention for oneself, retiring and modest.	CHITCHAT
Or I I would say both, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's like your Africa.	CHITCHAT
You were apprehensive to bragging.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Chris, who asking?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We don't know where it's already talked about it.	CHITCHAT
We just like using pig sounding words to sound smart.	CHITCHAT
Hence work.	CHITCHAT
That's why we sound so smart.	CHITCHAT
Ah, I see.	CHITCHAT
Look at him.	CHITCHAT
He's in the big word.	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like I don't know what I'm doing now.	CHITCHAT
Now we gotta get a timer to see how long it takes you to say, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
See now.	CHITCHAT
Also, how long have we been going for?	CHITCHAT
I just please.	CHITCHAT
It's almost been 2 hours within an hour and 40 already.	CHITCHAT
You can wrap up than ever, but I kind of kind of flew by.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, did.	CHITCHAT
Crazy.	CHITCHAT
That's Crazy Boy.	CHITCHAT
What happened?	CHITCHAT
Seven too much fun.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Yes so.	CHITCHAT
Happy having a lot more fun if my Cemetery work though.	O
I was struggling with the brush.	O
The other data symmetry, so I guess we were great.	O
I don't know what I did to my model, but basically I kept sculpting an I was working on the oblique muscles, which is like right underneath the armpit after the stream.	O
Something up 'cause when I like put those of eat mussels in, they didn't show on the other side and I was like Oh no message symmetry on.	O
So then I like control the The Heck out of it.	CHITCHAT
Put symmetry on which then I turned it of-.	O
And then they tried it again.	O
I just messed up the model and now it's showing up on the bottom.	O
So that's my bad so.	CHITCHAT
But I get it.	CHITCHAT
That was my Ted talk.	CHITCHAT
So that's my Ted talk, symmetries, hard.	CHITCHAT
This is, yeah, negative torch yourself instead of humility, Self Efficacy.	CHITCHAT
This seems more like it is the opposite of boastful or humility is near the middle.	CHITCHAT
Good to learn everything everything.	CHITCHAT
Which is something now.	CHITCHAT
OK, OK, OK I gotta get away with it.	CHITCHAT
I thought I could get away with so much more interesting.	CHITCHAT

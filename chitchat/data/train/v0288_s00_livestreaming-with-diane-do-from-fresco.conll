Hello test test.	CHITCHAT
Going to do a quick late night fresco stream.	CHITCHAT
Super lady.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Someone told me that my mic was super quiet.	CHITCHAT
Last time.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if this is better.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And also chat didn't show up for me so.	CHITCHAT
I am usually pretty good at reading chat, so if.	CHITCHAT
I don't see your messages then if I'm not reading responding to you, that means I can't see chat.	CHITCHAT
But just let me know.	CHITCHAT
Say hi.	CHITCHAT
Test it out.	CHITCHAT
Uh, what I'm going to do here is.	CHITCHAT
Just do it.	CHITCHAT
A little doodle I was sketching out as a sketching.	O
I was sketching out.	O
On photo shop, earlier some uh concept from World of Warcraft.	O
Just a screenshot and I was doing some studies and they took another screenshot of this character, so I want to kind of draw him.	O
He's like a little turtle character.	O
Like a fat turtle, I love it.	O
Some kind of like?	O
Drawing his shapes.	O
To understand the character concept.	O
That's that's his general.	O
Shape there.	O
And his part of his belly, I guess, is shell noise.	O
Shell is up here.	O
But his shell is like really tiny.	O
It's kind of.	CHITCHAT
It's really adorable.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, um.	CHITCHAT
Let me.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if I should have might be hand stream up on my phone.	CHITCHAT
Can you guys hear me alright?	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I know it's late, so if you guys.	CHITCHAT
Just wanna chill and lurk.	CHITCHAT
I think usually my fresco streams are.	CHITCHAT
Like that?	CHITCHAT
So I thought maybe I'll try.	CHITCHAT
I tried the morning Cresco stream.	CHITCHAT
And you know what I want to try.	CHITCHAT
The night time ones and see if they're different.	CHITCHAT
If I like the vibe.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I really hope you guys can hear me alright.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if the last time it was quiet 'cause it was like whispering 'cause It's night time and I feel like night time I need a whisper.	CHITCHAT
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Night.	CHITCHAT
You can hear me OK.	CHITCHAT
How you doing Anthony?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm using a new, not new.	CHITCHAT
It's new for me for using fresco, but I got wired headphones 'cause before I had Bluetooth headphones and the Bluetooth would not connect.	CHITCHAT
And so.	CHITCHAT
I decided to use his wired ones and they actually connect to fresco.	CHITCHAT
The last time I use them, they were just dangling like normal.	CHITCHAT
Now I literally have them like super close to my mouth.	CHITCHAT
I look I look stupid.	CHITCHAT
But as long as it works, right?	CHITCHAT
This is, I'm just kind of sketching, uhm?	O

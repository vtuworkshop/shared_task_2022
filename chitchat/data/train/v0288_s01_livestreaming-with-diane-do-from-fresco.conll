One of the World of Warcraft characters I saw while questing today.	O
Yes, I got sucked back into it.	O
But I'm you know what, I'm taking a different approach when I'm playing now I am actually.	O
Taking lots of Screenshots and I want to study.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The character designs I wanted to draw.	O
Like the environment, the characters.	O
Even the objects.	O
Let me let me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, is this a little better?	CHITCHAT
We're doing a test I this is it's in different position now.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if it's sounds better.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad chat works.	CHITCHAT
'cause last time people were talking and chat didn't work.	CHITCHAT
So Anthony says all sound is a little money and it picks up your breath little sometimes, but it works.	CHITCHAT
The noise is too vague.	CHITCHAT
Clear require OK.	CHITCHAT
The noise, the noises, too bad really.	CHITCHAT
People are saying it's quiet.	CHITCHAT
Oops my bad.	CHITCHAT
OK, I need to change that in settings.	CHITCHAT
App settings.	CHITCHAT
Input touch.	CHITCHAT
Wait, no, that's not what I want to do a racer.	CHITCHAT
Change the racer too soft round.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys are wondering what program I'm using, I'm using Adobe fresco on the iPad pro an.	CHITCHAT
Up This is mark by the way, yeah?	CHITCHAT
I recognize the name yet.	CHITCHAT
But whenever whatever your name says there, I say that name.	CHITCHAT
So I have a hard time seeing Jason instead of sticky 'cause his it says sticky.	CHITCHAT
And then he gets mad at me.	CHITCHAT
You know me.	CHITCHAT
It's Jason.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I think you just go to your profile or your Behance.	CHITCHAT
I'll be on behance.net.	CHITCHAT
You can click on your name and I think you can.	CHITCHAT
Change your name under your Behance profile.	CHITCHAT
You can edit your profile.	CHITCHAT
That's how I edited my name, although the trick is they they require last name, which we've already.	CHITCHAT
Everyone has already put in a suggestion to just do have one line, kind of like Twitter.	CHITCHAT
'cause there's a lot of people with a 1 one word brand like me like shaky like ink.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of us.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I'm using Adobe fresco and.	CHITCHAT
Currently I don't know if it's open to everyone, but they do have an option where you can stream from fresco straight to be hands.	CHITCHAT
And that's what I'm testing right now.	CHITCHAT
That's why it's not my usual setup.	CHITCHAT
But it's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm literally laying on my bed.	CHITCHAT
Literally laying in my bed.	CHITCHAT
I'm so glad I can actually see chat now.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is.	CHITCHAT
Oh, This is crazy.	CHITCHAT
It looks like he has fingernails on his skin.	CHITCHAT
Like right here.	CHITCHAT
So cool the dream.	CHITCHAT
How you doing?	CHITCHAT

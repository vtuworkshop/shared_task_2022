Cameron says, Have you ever tried animation or different types of art like fine art?	CHITCHAT
You mean when you say fine art, do you mean like traditional art, like using traditional mediums?	CHITCHAT
Funny thing about animation, I started my I started getting into art through animation.	CHITCHAT
A friend of mine asked me if I wanted to take an art class with her.	CHITCHAT
And I was like, yeah, sure, and it was a it was a 2D Animation class or traditional animation class where we have to draw out every page.	CHITCHAT
And I liked it.	CHITCHAT
And from there I was like you know what?	CHITCHAT
This is interesting.	CHITCHAT
So I started drawing from that animation class, but I never got into animation.	CHITCHAT
That was the only time I animated.	CHITCHAT
But I would like to try it.	CHITCHAT
Maybe just little animations.	CHITCHAT
Maybe like Ryan Silvey does where he uses after effects and he animates like graphics.	CHITCHAT
I want to maybe dive into that so I can.	CHITCHAT
So I can just learn something new.	CHITCHAT
I I used to do more traditional art and then I got into digital.	CHITCHAT
It would do a lot of my favorite.	CHITCHAT
Traditional medium is Inc.	CHITCHAT
I love doing ink washes, Ann.	CHITCHAT
I want to eventually.	CHITCHAT
Get more practice into watercolor 'cause I really like how random and chaotic it is.	CHITCHAT
And being able to manipulate the medium to look nice is such a challenge, and I sometimes I love challenges, especially when it turns out right.	CHITCHAT

I started off with a lot of Anime Style Art.	CHITCHAT
'cause That's, uh, I think a lot of people get inspired to draw from watching anime.	CHITCHAT
They want to draw their favorite characters and those main.	CHITCHAT
I'll definitely inspired to draw like.	CHITCHAT
Dragon Ball characters.	CHITCHAT
Naruto stuff.	CHITCHAT
When I was younger so I picked up drawing as a kid.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It was mainly that.	CHITCHAT
Started like doing a little bit of photo shop when I was around 12 or 13 and it was like that for.	CHITCHAT
Just like a year or so.	CHITCHAT
And then I gave it up to do other things because I felt like at that time I didn't know about the gaming industry and that you could design characters with cool swords and weapons and all that to do to be in games.	CHITCHAT
I thought doing art meant you postings in gallery's.	CHITCHAT
And how people buy them and you'll pour until your dead.	CHITCHAT
I thought that's what it meant to be an artist I like now there's no future for that so I just I just dropped out from like between 15 until I was like.	CHITCHAT
Until I saw.	CHITCHAT
Video online about Blizzard and half stones and how.	CHITCHAT
People do paintings for those.	CHITCHAT
And then I was like, wait a second.	CHITCHAT
That's like a job and I looked into it and I saw this like character designers as well.	CHITCHAT
People didn't really like the odd I suit could potentially become like.	CHITCHAT
Game stuff as I told them so I picked it up again when I was 23.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I didn't go to University or anything for this.	CHITCHAT
I tried to, I didn't enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
I think it's very slow in Australia if you want to learn that over here, it's not worth it.	CHITCHAT
So I did online study by myself.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Picked up a mental ship with Anthony Jones.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I got my first job in two years after two years of self study.	CHITCHAT
Coffee time with Jeff.	CHITCHAT
That's Leica, Leica.	CHITCHAT
Shorter version.	CHITCHAT
Of my story, only go more in depth I can.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to ask me anything about any particular.	CHITCHAT
Time period you want to know about.	CHITCHAT
'cause there's a lot.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's a lot of information between that.	CHITCHAT
You know, we could probably talk about it anyway, since.	CHITCHAT
Something else we talked about today.	CHITCHAT
I have a few stories.	CHITCHAT
I think I told it to some of you guys are ready.	CHITCHAT
I'll tell it again so.	CHITCHAT
When I didn't know what I wanted to or like, there's like a period when I wasn't sure how I wanted to approach learning concept art, and I was like confused.	CHITCHAT
Like A lot of people.	CHITCHAT
With their approach and how to get there?	CHITCHAT
An I applied full University.	CHITCHAT
That's like it's like one of those.	CHITCHAT
This is not a University specifically for.	CHITCHAT
Now I spent two years learning stuff.	CHITCHAT
Will sending University specifically for animation.	CHITCHAT
It was one of like Sydney's.	CHITCHAT
Bigger universities like one of the Big Three universities and they offered a brand new animation course like this the first year they opened, so that's pretty good timing.	CHITCHAT
So I applied for that.	CHITCHAT
I only just started.	CHITCHAT
Painting at that time and I even have the paintings that I'm referring to, and I use that as like My Portfolio.	CHITCHAT
I'm ready to have that portfolio to be honest.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy, you guys want to see this?	CHITCHAT
I don't think I've ever shown in this part 'cause I forgot that I have this portfolio.	CHITCHAT
Let me try to find it.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I did my first pop for you ever for when I went to.	CHITCHAT
US only get anything out of it though, but I do have that.	CHITCHAT
But I want to find this other one, the one that's even earlier.	CHITCHAT
I really want to see it.	CHITCHAT
Up It was my it was the one that I applied for us.	CHITCHAT

Switch should be like in a folder though.	CHITCHAT
I've already got some like random pages from it.	CHITCHAT
So I can see.	CHITCHAT
So is all over the place, I included.	CHITCHAT
Stuff I did for graphic design this stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm like I'm laughing 'cause I'm hesitant to show some of the other ones, but I'll show it.	CHITCHAT
This was in there.	CHITCHAT
When I color suddenly changed, you guys see that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
This was in here.	CHITCHAT
This stuff all cringe.	CHITCHAT
This is in there.	CHITCHAT
My first concept cheese.	CHITCHAT
Yikes.	CHITCHAT
I did a storyboard.	CHITCHAT
Professional level stuff man.	CHITCHAT
I think that's it.	CHITCHAT
That's all the pages.	CHITCHAT
Know this logo JC.	CHITCHAT
Oh geez, just nothing that bad, that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh old is old.	CHITCHAT
I hold on let me get that story board again.	CHITCHAT
OK yeah, look at that logo man, that's his JC there.	CHITCHAT
See the dot for the J and then it becomes a see what a logo genius absolute genius.	CHITCHAT
OK, so that's like this is the stuff I submitted that cold out man.	CHITCHAT
Did you see the color shift again?	CHITCHAT
Look at this, you guys see that.	CHITCHAT
Sweet what's happening there?	CHITCHAT
But that's look at that.	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
He squats, definitely squats.	CHITCHAT
Kind of nice to Jim a bit more though.	CHITCHAT
The graphic design stuff I did for the.	CHITCHAT
Aw man is cringey for the.	CHITCHAT
Graphic design course I did.	CHITCHAT
Like my first one of the first paintings I did.	CHITCHAT
Ann What I was told at the interview was like.	CHITCHAT
'cause that guy had something against anyway.	CHITCHAT
So he was like he saw this and he thought it was animated.	CHITCHAT
Some reason it's like not even close.	CHITCHAT
It was like you should take this stuff and hide it under your bed.	CHITCHAT
That's what he said to me I remember.	CHITCHAT
And then, like the beginning of the interviews, so that kind of set the whole tone for everything.	CHITCHAT
And I'll say, OK.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
That's not very cool and I like I didn't really enjoy the interview the whole time.	CHITCHAT
And I left.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking like, OK, yeah, definitely didn't make make it into the University because of this guy, but it didn't turn out that I got offered.	CHITCHAT
Position in the animation cool spot I was like so mad at what he said that unlike his there's a few things that annoy me about this one.	CHITCHAT
His like his dismissing.	CHITCHAT
And I'm being like Genesee his dismissing 50% of the animation industry.	CHITCHAT
If you just if you discount anime.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and two.	CHITCHAT
That wasn't even anyway, so it just shows he doesn't know what he's talking about.	CHITCHAT
So that really annoyed me and I was like that from that day, like I set a goal, is like I'm going to find my own way without this guy.	CHITCHAT
And get a job.	CHITCHAT
Before any of his students will.	CHITCHAT
So I set two years as my goal to get a job.	CHITCHAT
Just to beat like anyone or anything that he had to offer in his stupid course.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I did.	CHITCHAT
And now here's another thing he said to me.	CHITCHAT
No, during his his presentation for that animation called feels like if like he had a slide shirt, right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
He said if you do like life drawing.	CHITCHAT
And if you just like don't do any of this stuff and you post stuff like pictures of.	CHITCHAT
Digital like models instead of real life ones.	CHITCHAT
So you do any of that and it's useless.	CHITCHAT
You have to do like the real life ones and he was like laughing and mocking people who do digital digital studies.	CHITCHAT
An like I always like one did but like now like.	CHITCHAT
I don't doubt at all that like digital works.	CHITCHAT
If you want to do that kind of study, I learned I've learned a lot from looking at digital models.	CHITCHAT
If anything, I'd say digital models are better because in real life you go if you go to life drawing.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, the model you see there is just going to be like this tiny black.	CHITCHAT
You didn't see anything.	CHITCHAT
Oh by Nicholas.	CHITCHAT
Alright, enjoy dinner.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll be.	CHITCHAT
I'll be here for two hours.	CHITCHAT
Probably not complaining about what I'm talking bout now, but I'll be here.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, yeah, he was like I don't know, this guy is just super cocky I think and now is like a professional.	CHITCHAT
I completely disagree with a lot of things.	CHITCHAT
He says an disagree with that person being.	CHITCHAT
He's a course coordinator.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
If you're smart enough to somehow convince universities one of the top three universities to follow him an.	CHITCHAT
Do a course that he coordinates, then you know good for him but.	CHITCHAT
I also think it's very bad that he's representing an animation course and.	CHITCHAT
He is the voice and like the guidance for young people, it's horrible.	CHITCHAT
I think him as a person.	CHITCHAT
His beliefs as an artist.	CHITCHAT
Are not suitable for what is current like relevant.	CHITCHAT
Currently relevant to the industry.	CHITCHAT
Very misleading in my opinion and I hope he's not still.	CHITCHAT
The person behind the course.	CHITCHAT
I got good too like getting like and I think like this shaped a lot of my life like I realized.	CHITCHAT
From that moment, like if I want anything.	CHITCHAT
I can do it myself.	CHITCHAT
I don't have to rely on anyone.	CHITCHAT
And I did get petty.	CHITCHAT
It's like I wanted to get good.	CHITCHAT
Just the proof.	CHITCHAT
People wrong.	CHITCHAT
As the best feeling when you make it.	CHITCHAT
And that definitely definitely shapes alot of how I am now.	CHITCHAT
You can definitely work in a team relying people, but.	CHITCHAT
In the end, like you're the only one you can 100% trust to get things done.	CHITCHAT
It's cancel that.	CHITCHAT
Another thing is like cancel anyone.	CHITCHAT
And I do have like like these like dreams of like.	CHITCHAT
Like they invite me to talk about industry stuff at that University and then I forgot.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, love too and like like they forgot about who I am or something and then I called him out and like yeah this place is pretty good but that guys don't trust him in this course is like not great.	CHITCHAT
I really want to do that.	CHITCHAT
I could, but not probably not.	CHITCHAT
Even if they offer me like an opportunity to talk there.	CHITCHAT
Anything I do that another anything except except to talk?	CHITCHAT
But I'd love to.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I hope it's not leading people down the wrong path.	CHITCHAT
Until mature for that Hey, you say I'm old.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's it's becoming like I still care about that quite a lot.	CHITCHAT
When I before the first job, I guess like I'll think about it.	CHITCHAT
It wouldn't like haunt me, but like it really really drive me end.	CHITCHAT
These days I'm coming to peace with it, it's.	CHITCHAT
So what happened in part of my journey?	CHITCHAT
It's an interesting story to talk about as well.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, don't let the anger control your brain.	CHITCHAT
But you may not feel any anger anymore.	CHITCHAT
I'm like a robot.	CHITCHAT
I never really was angry either.	CHITCHAT
I think I accepted it as how it is, and I understood that Australia is very limited.	CHITCHAT
And it was just my.	CHITCHAT
Driving force to do better.	CHITCHAT
That's how I, that's how I sort of perceived it, I think.	CHITCHAT
The way he said that, though, no, sounds like you had a story behind letting anger control your brain.	CHITCHAT

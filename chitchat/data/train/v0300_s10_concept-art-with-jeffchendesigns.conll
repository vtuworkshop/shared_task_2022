I went out shopping, went out to eat last night as well.	CHITCHAT
And things feel like they're getting busier again.	CHITCHAT
And I wonder how they will go.	CHITCHAT
I think the difference now 'cause like the numbers feels similar to web covid started for like just started for Australia.	CHITCHAT
But we're down to those numbers and I think the difference now is people feel less scared because we feel like it's more controlled back then.	CHITCHAT
It's like we don't know how out of control was.	CHITCHAT
We didn't know we didn't have much testing, so you don't know what the actual numbers are and that's what the fear.	CHITCHAT
That's where the fear comes in.	CHITCHAT
But now that it's like die down, we have more control of how many people actually have it.	CHITCHAT

Public misconception for students maybe?	CHITCHAT
About getting hired.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Their hopes for what kind of quality they put in their portfolio.	CHITCHAT
This is.	CHITCHAT
Weird idea that.	CHITCHAT
You know, maybe they'll see your work.	CHITCHAT
And see that potential.	CHITCHAT
I think it's all about that.	CHITCHAT
The feeling that maybe they can in turn and teach you.	CHITCHAT
But being a very competitive industry.	CHITCHAT
It's very unlikely that ever happens unless you have connections.	CHITCHAT
And then if you have connections, it's like while they use their money to teach you when there's people out there that already can do the work.	CHITCHAT
Why hire junior when there's so many mid level people out there?	CHITCHAT
So I guess what I'm trying to say is.	CHITCHAT
Put in the time.	CHITCHAT
In practice, get good at your craft and don't hope for.	CHITCHAT
A person to see your potential by instead.	CHITCHAT
Trust only yourself to improve and get better.	CHITCHAT
So that you don't have to rely on someone else.	CHITCHAT
Because you can control how you use your time.	CHITCHAT
But you can't control how.	CHITCHAT
Lockwood work in this, getting the right person to.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you think that you have potential.	CHITCHAT
To us, even like.	CHITCHAT
A friend helping you out, it's like.	CHITCHAT
Say I ran a studio and someone asked me like Hey can I help you out?	CHITCHAT
It's like even if you wanted to help out, what can they really do if they aren't level isn't there then?	CHITCHAT
It's really hard to assign any work to them.	CHITCHAT
I sort of.	CHITCHAT
I've had that happen.	CHITCHAT
Just doesn't workout.	CHITCHAT
Right and see how braided hair works.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Honest reason different from any other industry in many regards.	CHITCHAT
You can draw lots of.	CHITCHAT
Analogies between this and other industries?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I guess so.	CHITCHAT
Very true.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, are there any industries that just like higher from potential?	CHITCHAT
I think that happens anymore, huh?	CHITCHAT
Like just cassone shows drive doesn't mean that that's not really enough.	CHITCHAT
Trying to figure out how grades work.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking like, whoa.	CHITCHAT
OK, so one goes in the other one does a thing and then.	CHITCHAT
But Cousin this this one comes back.	CHITCHAT
OK OK, OK, there we go.	CHITCHAT
This is something happen.	CHITCHAT
Is the tricky thing.	CHITCHAT

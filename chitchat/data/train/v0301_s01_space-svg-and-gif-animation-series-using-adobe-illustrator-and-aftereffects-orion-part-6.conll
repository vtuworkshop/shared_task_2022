Light and shading, which is he's like geometric shapes, is super cold and so loved his work.	CHITCHAT
So let's get into it.	CHITCHAT
I want to get started on our animations.	O
You'll see I've got our SVG open again yesterday and I've got a whole bunch more stuff happening.	O
I've got, um.	CHITCHAT
Got the stars animating on and off.	O
That was a little bit a little bit crazy chaotic to get you'll see all of the stuff I have over here for each one of these stars has their own transform origin there all animating with the same.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Animation the star falls appear, but I have office.	O
I've said it a layout, all of them so.	O
Salmon arm and then the animate all.	O
Obviously I still need to line them up so that the stars and the lines for Ryan animate.	O
Turn off the same time, but like In Sync, but I wanted to show you guys got that going on and then I animated the.	O
Arm here with a wrench.	O
There's some timing things I need to adjust.	O
I don't like the way these two look like.	O
They're both kind of pausing the same spots, so I'll probably go in and adjust that and then probably I gotta sit animate $3 lines down here for the like Sparks coming off so.	O
Call bunch.	O
Other stuff I need to get into here but got pretty good.	O
Solid amount of work done on that so I'm gonna close this because Adam was like my computer is having a time running like Adam and illustrator and all kinds of stuff going to close that guy.	O
Metro saved it right.	O
Well, I am going to open up.	O
I've illustrated up here out of the way, so I have our illustrator file open up here.	O
I'm going to open this up in after effects, but I want to show you guys something pretty cool that I.	O
Can you come?	CHITCHAT
This is the file that used for the SPG, so everything in this file is sort of groups altogether.	O
I love you.	CHITCHAT
You see that I've got a Orion is, uh, a layer name, uh, with all of these individual uhm.	O
Groups inside of it and I found out that you can go over the layer panel and you can go to this release layers.	O
Lily's letter sequence.	O
It will break apart all of your groups are objects into individual layers, which is super handy for bringing your file over to the after effects so I can just pull things, grab all of these.	O
By holding shift cooking, drag him out and like every part of our.	O
Spaceman is now on its own layer, which is Super Handy.	O
As far as the share that.	CHITCHAT
Set of knowledge with you guys because I was super helpful.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I don't know whether I thought started his back alright.	O
Yeah, I think I have everything set up and ready to go straight into after effects.	O

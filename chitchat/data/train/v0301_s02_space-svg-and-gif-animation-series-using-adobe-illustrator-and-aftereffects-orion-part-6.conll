Let me just double check and make sure that I have everything I want to animate.	O
Essentially broken out.	O
One thing I'm probably going to do is get rid of.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
We're going to see I'm going to see if I can.	O
I need, I know.	CHITCHAT
When I did this the last time I had to use like a reference.	O
Or placement of the stars over the lines for the UM.	O
Consolation and then just animate for once are an copy that.	O
The error rates are like offset.	O
Uhm, I can open up the space dollars one to show you guys.	O
So I think we're going to.	O
Probably um.	CHITCHAT
Get rid of most of these stars.	O
And just leave one of the big ones, the ones little ones and do the same kind of thing that we did before 4.	O
Yeah one so I'm gonna do that now.	O
Just gonna grab most of these guys.	O
Out of here.	O
Just leave.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Network World.	O
What's happening there we go.	CHITCHAT
It's weird that was weird.	CHITCHAT
Something odd just happened.	CHITCHAT
That's OK, sort it all right, so I'm going to leave that.	O
I want these three separate layers 'cause I want to animate these stars individually, so I'm just not take him out.	O
Sounds like that.	O
Who's your name?	CHITCHAT
This one?	CHITCHAT
Probably for the sake of my own sanity is big and little star.	O
Well so far.	O
Pixar.	O
You guys haven't noticed.	CHITCHAT
I do also have my NASA shirt on today and what people see it, but it's a shirt on today.	CHITCHAT
I never did wind up getting a space helmet, so that's the thing unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Let me think about what I want to do here.	O
I don't actually think I will need to reference the The thing they know pretty much where all the stars need to line up on these points here, so not too worried about the meetings layer, especially Saturday have.	O
Copies of all.	O
We just delete that.	O
So got our fire on separate layers or applicable star star.	O
Lines for.	O
If you need translation itself.	O
He got.	CHITCHAT
Are there?	CHITCHAT
Probably gonna have to pre compose a Orion back together so that we can move him independently, but that should theoretically be easier than it was in our SVG information so.	O
I'm just gonna go for it.	O
I'm gonna save an I'm gonna open up.	O
After effects.	O
I have not opened after effects.	O
Admittedly, since the update so.	O
Probably gonna prompt me too.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Look at a tutorial or something.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Now these new icons have you guys seen the new CC?	O
I well of course.	O
Yeah, I hope you have new CC icons.	O
So Ryan is saying that he used QuickTime player recorder, screen perfect.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I've done that before.	CHITCHAT
The only problem with using the QuickTime player to record your screen is that it makes the files that makes are enormous and I was kind of having to like compress something there is huge.	O
Humongous files Nick is saying Happy Space Sounds I don't even know what state sounds.	O
What is the space have?	CHITCHAT
I have no idea.	CHITCHAT
So you said thanks a lot, Sarah Sarah saying oh look at those gloves.	CHITCHAT

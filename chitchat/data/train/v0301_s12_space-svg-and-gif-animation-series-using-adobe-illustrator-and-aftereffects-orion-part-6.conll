Really want to.	CHITCHAT
OK, so that's why I wanted to know why it was so difficult.	O
We're not even.	O
The struggle.	O
Oh, I know I'm not seeing anything 'cause I have the other one on top.	O
The one at that point.	O
But he wasn't the problem.	O
Well, Yeah.	CHITCHAT
All right now, let's go and try and edit this mask and less that was.	O
This was also gonna give me.	O

Bullet point.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Hourly forecast.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
OK, now I have two layers essentially.	O
With all of my.	O
Heather lines separated out.	O
Ray Well then I'm thinking it might have wanted to do that with the ISS group.	O
Ah, so many things I think about.	O
Hey mom, how's it going?	CHITCHAT
Now says.	CHITCHAT
Hello everybody hello.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Man um in after effects.	O
I will give you.	O
This is where we ended up with.	O
Ask G Sugar.	O
Fix some timing things in particular the stars going on and off, and the.	O
Well, just some things, but that's where we're at with that, uh?	O
And we've got our.	O
After effects animation going here.	O
That are only settle stars on there.	O
Just trying to group everything.	O
Super fast we done so far.	O
We added that subtle like background highlight.	O
Basically similar to what we did with the dog animation.	O
So that's where we're at and I was just trying to separate out these two.	O
Heathers trying animate the movement of the ISS inside the clipping mask basically.	O
That's right, so um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, now I brought you another creepy medical.	O
Thing today.	O

Model CL nerves.	O
Awesome so accord.	O
Got the tailbone sacrum and got the five.	O
Lumbar vertebrae there's also thoracic vertebrae, and, um, cervical vertebrae.	O
There are Seven cervical, 12 thoracic, and then we got the slide.	O
Lumbar vertebrae, so it's just a model of, is fine with the nerves like a rubbery material, so let me go another one of my weird, uh?	O
Things I am just for your mouth.	O

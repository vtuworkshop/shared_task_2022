That switch over at this is over OK.	O
Open notebook.	O
Alright, let's start with the need to do the.	O
The seller in the ISS.	O
I'm actually going to bring this one up to the top here so I can make both of these layers together essentially.	O
I'm gonna hide that guy for the time being, and I do wonder if I should have.	O
I do wonder if I should go to these and then put the mask.	O
An animate.	O
That way I feel like that's probably the way to go, so.	O
Who did that?	CHITCHAT
Please compose these as ISS together.	O
Portion doesn't want to face where I wanted to.	O
Inside each deal.	O
Not like tremendously worried about.	O
That's not funny after it's really not gonna move very far.	O
But we eat at other points here.	O
What movies are out?	O
So I want to get the whole.	O
Hang in there and give it a little bit of room to move around so.	O
When they were gonna go here.	O
This would be a.	O
Mousing, yay.	O
I'm glad you like it a while.	O
The details insane.	O
I would use it to put my sunglass collection on.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that would be a great idea, like they do have them in stores.	CHITCHAT
You've got the eyeglass shops that had spines in them where they put sunglasses on the spines.	CHITCHAT
That is, I don't know what kind of I, I I eyeglass source, why my opthamologist?	CHITCHAT
I don't know why that word was a scaping me right away.	CHITCHAT
You're shopping for glasses is essentially what I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
Their displays include.	CHITCHAT
Sunglasses on splines maybe?	CHITCHAT
I want to shop there.	CHITCHAT
We have a shop here in Cleveland called Cleveland Curiosity's, which I still have not been too.	CHITCHAT
I know shame shame on me because that is like it seems like it's right up my alley.	CHITCHAT
You should look it up, it's just a shop that sells variety of weird.	CHITCHAT
Auto science scientific stuff um.	CHITCHAT
A lot of taxidermy and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
The interesting thing about that place is that they.	CHITCHAT
So the interesting thing about Ohio in general is that Ohio allows you to allows the sale of human remains, switch a lot of states do not, but you can buy human bones in Ohio, so they have like human skulls and stuff like that, which is kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
They're very expensive as they should be, and I don't really have any desire to own one.	CHITCHAT
You know, as a collectible, because that's not what I see this stuff as.	CHITCHAT
I like to look at the stuff because, um, the yeah Cleveland query.	CHITCHAT
Put a link.	CHITCHAT
So pleasing curiosity things I find interesting about this is from, you know, studying.	CHITCHAT
Anatomy and being a medical illustrator, it's always nice to have the physical.	CHITCHAT
Reference like this, I think because.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We had a lot of you know, skeleton, uh, when I was in college and I found it helpful.	CHITCHAT
Just see how light interacts with the structure from different angles and you know for shortening and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
So it's nice to have.	CHITCHAT
We were doing like, uh.	CHITCHAT
He still like a figurehead of figure drawing class where we would do like.	O
Figured attritional figure drawing, but we would then like.	O
Also include the anatomy underneath.	O
So like skeletal structure.	O
So being able to study and see you know with that kind of stuff looks like.	O
You know when it's like for short and and stuff like that is helpful.	O
Directions.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
That's my speech.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, mouse is, uh, so strange and fascinating.	O

I have a real skeleton line.	O
Yeah, we all do.	CHITCHAT
We all do have real skeletons.	O
You yeah so.	CHITCHAT
That's the thing that's a tangent that we just went on.	O
I feel like there's a way to Automate this part, and I'm not 100% sure what it is.	O
They may do some research and figure that out for that I'm how to light use expressions too.	O
It's something I had with that mean to have this kind of rotate around so I don't have to sit here like.	O
Do it by hand and I don't know what that is so.	O
Yeah, sure he would like that shop is pretty cool.	O
So we want to move the position of the Sky around.	O
Yeah, and.	CHITCHAT
I want to start.	O
Years and I want it to move relatively slowly.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Play movie.	O
Cool too much too much already.	O
Even get very far.	O
Just a tiny bit up.	O
Which way it starts?	O
So it goes down down first down into the light goes.	O
Uh, what counter?	CHITCHAT
Clockwise essentially.	O
Under astronauts going clockwise so.	O
I'm gonna bring it.	O
Not down, I don't want anything mass.	O
Oh my God, this is the problem I had the last time we were only fixed it.	CHITCHAT
Did we anime inside of the group and then?	O
OK, I can get out of existence.	O
How do we fix this?	CHITCHAT
Last time, you guys?	CHITCHAT
I remember having to drag to link the mask.	O
Or something?	O
Let's go take a look at.	O
We did not consolation one before.	O
I totally screwed up.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
No, we use this circle.	O
Shave.	O
Alpha Wasn't what I wanted you.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
This back up.	O
Yeah, of course I need to apply the animation to an element with mass element.	O
I need to go into the actual composition, which is what my initial thought was.	O
I don't know why I would second guess myself with.	O
What in the hell?	O
Oh, right, 'cause I haven't together, um.	O
Yes myself with uh.	O
After effects, but I do.	O
No Korea, right uh?	O
It doesn't.	O
Uhm, I don't think I think you're right, so.	O
I put the mask on the.	O
Composition so I should be able to move these guys.	O
Around.	O
In here.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just getting a test.	O
Break it down.	O
I'm going to open up my.	O
I think that should work.	O
Without looking mask.	O
Yeah, look at that success.	O
No, see Corey, you are a core said um, you just need to apply the animation whenever within the national debt.	O
Which is exactly why first thought and I should.	O
I was right.	CHITCHAT
Those who replies Mashreq within objects when you animated them too and yeah.	O
And then he said I'll wait, sorry we're not doing SVG F so that's why you need mode.	O
But yes, I you are correct in that I I need to go into this composition inside of the competition that I have made the mask applied over top of it.	O
So there we go.	CHITCHAT
Problem solved.	CHITCHAT
No, I got that guy.	CHITCHAT

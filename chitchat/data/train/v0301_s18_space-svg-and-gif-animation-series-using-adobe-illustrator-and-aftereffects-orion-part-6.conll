No, I just want this one.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So picky.	CHITCHAT
I'm being Super Nitpicky.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm gonna add an even less.	CHITCHAT
He's outside.	CHITCHAT
Text Christy Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Obviously I don't need to again repeat that movement, just like I need to repeat a whole bunch of things, but we're just trying to get all of the basic animating parts sort of laid in for this so.	O
Just feel like it's.	CHITCHAT
More aggressive then Yes we G.	O
Must be my beautiful slower.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Do you like it slower?	O
A little bit faster?	O
I like it a little bit faster, obviously.	O
Alright, What's next?	CHITCHAT
What's next on the list?	CHITCHAT
Probably.	O
Yeah, and you probably do the arm next I think.	O
Will move our way down the list of all the individual pieces of our astronaut from you.	O
Want animating and then control.	O
Compose everything together and.	O
Moving around, and so I think it's a little bit.	O
I think so, so next thing that I'm going to work on then he's probably be arm.	O
This should be.	O
I'm not gonna say it's pretty easy.	O
He's not even gonna say.	O
Honestly.	CHITCHAT
Are there that arm so it is?	O
Heard you need to adjust this point.	O
I always forget how to do this appointment.	O
That it rotates from issues, yeah?	O
Oh, I see this is.	CHITCHAT
I need to move this anchor points over so that I can.	O
Haven't animate from the joint.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Do you like going over hyper 7 CD asking?	O
I'm surprised how to do this on the first try.	O
Publix have accidentally done it wrong so many times like.	O
Not now like condition my brain.	O
To know where that option is.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
If you like, if nothing else, this series of uh.	O
Transmissions have been doing, um, SVG and after effects.	O
I hope you guys have been getting something out of this, but I feel like it is definitely been helping to buy.	O
After effects skills kind of.	O
Read improve I guess.	O
I use after effects so infrequently that I tend to like forget how to do things.	O
So now I'm at the point now where I'm sorry.	O
Well I remember how to do things and.	O
So yeah, unfortunately, they were also unfortunately at the end of our series of animation, but is that a good like a good opportunity to get back into it?	O
I remember.	CHITCHAT
My phone tricks so.	O
Chat going Corey is Superman and deserves a beer.	O

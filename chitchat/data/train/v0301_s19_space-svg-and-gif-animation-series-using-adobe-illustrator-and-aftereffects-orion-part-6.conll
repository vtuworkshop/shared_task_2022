Apparently my mouth says quarries being super managers.	CHITCHAT
Dear Jack Watson, just saying saying.	CHITCHAT
I mean you can have one I don't like.	CHITCHAT
We do what he wants his own person.	CHITCHAT
Of course, saying Jack Watson doesn't need any help to make.	CHITCHAT
Awesome thing I try um, but I'm not perfect and I don't know everything so.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
I'm still learning too.	CHITCHAT
Well, part of the process right?	CHITCHAT
Not saying you two are too humble and stick it in person, I think.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Position rotation rotation probation.	O
Can you see where I?	O
This will start going right away and I need to.	O
I feel OK remember doing like should be able to actually get the rotation degrees honest in the keyframes in our SVG.	O
So let's take a look at our SVG animation.	O
It should be able to see you getting like 5 degrees up and down.	O
For us Double check in here.	O
Scroll down to our arm was called wrench or rotate very descriptive.	O
I did 10.	O
Canon can turn up and down right.	O
So I told you and see how that looks should look pretty much the same.	O
What is the time?	CHITCHAT
No, I don't want to do that.	CHITCHAT
Quit using Intel.	O
It's annoying me and I'm also going to quit illustration for some reason so hard that open.	O
You have anytime now you got it, you got it.	O
10 Yeah.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Mobile device.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to exit out.	O
Like here.	CHITCHAT
Fast, really fast.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I was pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Hermes.	CHITCHAT
From easing on the arm as well, I don't remember.	O
What?	CHITCHAT
Without He's out and she wanted to hear.	O
Let's see how that looks.	CHITCHAT
Hello hello scroll then it just like scroll through the universe there.	O
That's pretty good.	CHITCHAT
So you want I need another like keep trying to bring it back to nothing.	O
So that should.	CHITCHAT
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
So everything is thus far.	O
I'm setting up to kind of.	O
I just haven't looked all of it yet.	O
I across and everything so.	O
Which I said I'm gonna try to do expressions and already experimented with yet, so I'll let you know how it goes.	O
Yeah, I definitely think that the.	O
What's the word?	O
I'm looking for the rotation, the movement on the ISS, the movement going around is a lot smoother and there's a couple of things I think there's advantages and disadvantages to after effects.	O
Yours, SVG animation, some of the things I did using the SPG animating were a little bit easier than in after effects, but then some of the things in after effects were a little bit easier, smoother than yesterday, so there's tradeoffs.	O
I'm writing about Valentine.	O
Always paranoid something out of illustrator honestly, and they both have different applications as user grade on the web.	O
You can export stuff out of after effects history on the web button.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Michael, get so far all right.	CHITCHAT

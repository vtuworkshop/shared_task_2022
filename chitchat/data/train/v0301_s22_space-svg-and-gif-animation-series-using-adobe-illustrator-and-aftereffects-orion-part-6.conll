Super cool.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, can request alright so.	CHITCHAT
He's actually in a fairly good job.	CHITCHAT
She needs.	CHITCHAT
Wonder if I can.	O
Wow.	CHITCHAT
Download this.	O
Dash in dash offset.	O
This should look very familiar to.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
You guys.	CHITCHAT
Crap.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, um.	CHITCHAT
Marquez creator saying Hello, Goodnight sorry works love every constantly use Brazil sends you a warm hot out.	CHITCHAT
Thank you I uh.	CHITCHAT
Now is all to become common people from South America, and I feel like it was another person from Brazil.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes frequent so very cool.	CHITCHAT
You could join us.	CHITCHAT
Sarah Mason if you well, if you have any questions let me know.	CHITCHAT
Answer for you.	CHITCHAT
Marquez so fair saying I was just going to say it will probably give you a pass for each dash.	CHITCHAT
Um, it did not.	CHITCHAT
It gave me dash lines which is.	CHITCHAT
Really pretty impressed and you'll see here this dash gap and offset.	CHITCHAT
It's very similar to what we looked at and he animated the SPG itself.	CHITCHAT
I'm quite excited about that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how useful it will be.	CHITCHAT
So I can animate them is another story.	CHITCHAT
I did give me a breakdown.	CHITCHAT
Looks like.	CHITCHAT
Dash line women.	CHITCHAT
Make sure which one we have selected.	O
Let's see what happens if we know, Yeah, look at that.	O
That is soon.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's like that is interesting and neat.	O
I am.	CHITCHAT
Uh, this is exciting.	CHITCHAT
This is an exciting discovery.	CHITCHAT
It make.	CHITCHAT
It's going to make a yeah could make animating in after effects.	O
Interesting for me in future.	O
Being able to activate select email to pull in the dashed lines from illustrator and be able to animate the dashes.	O
He did awesome.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how long standing after infections could be a feature that that it could.	O
It could have been a thing that like you can pull in dash lines Mills here and they pull in with the dashes for along time I just never noticed until this time in my life so.	O
I think that we should try it and see what happens.	O
So this dash is going to extend the length of our line.	O
And the.	CHITCHAT
Gas is going to increase the spacing, so Santos King is as good as a layer separation discovered.	O
Now no, I think that that's probably still.	O
The best thing I found out is that that like layer sequencing.	O
Sooner is hands down one of the heaviest things that I have discovered.	O
Who's the pain like separate out like kind of filter file.	O
So graphic right after effect?	O
Well it.	CHITCHAT
It's good for my process.	CHITCHAT
They have a tendency to like group everything 'cause I'm thinking SVG and not necessary after effects when I'm starting out or just touched.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I work with groups in Elgin troops and layers and exercise separating things up.	O
That's my hierarchy in my brain.	O
So having that layer sequence is definitely cool picture.	O
I don't know it.	CHITCHAT
Again, this is like I'm so excited.	CHITCHAT
Was also do.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, I don't even know where to start.	CHITCHAT
Start so cool.	CHITCHAT
Is theoretically we can have the dash is like.	O
You have them animate.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like longer an get smaller and more spread out as they fade out.	O
I'm going to get sucked into this and like this is just.	O
This is just so cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT

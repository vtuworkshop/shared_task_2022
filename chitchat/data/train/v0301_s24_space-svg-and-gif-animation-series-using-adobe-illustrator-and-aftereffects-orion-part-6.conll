We have so that thing is certain this guy and having fun with this like.	O
Dash line animation here and save that.	O
And but we also did, so we not only did we do the illustration illustrator, we exported this out.	O
Put it into after effects in the animation today.	O
Yesterday worked on this SVG animation of our spaceman.	O
Obviously you see I need to go back in and clean up sometime and stuff and then animate the dashed lines in this which.	O
Yeah, I think the winds for today, where, uhm, uh, the layer sequence and um, you cash line animation stuff from.	O
After effects, CC list and.	O
That nothing exploded, and my including my brain so that I will take that as a win.	O
So this will help with this.	CHITCHAT
I've gotta go back and do some cleanup on all of these and then I will post them to bring into the big project about all of all the work that we did sketches that we did the final illustration, final animations.	O
Here's their dog, rose.	CHITCHAT
Sacados Canes Major and minor?	CHITCHAT
Um constellations will show that really quickly, as we wrap up.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if you have any questions or anything.	CHITCHAT
Thanks everybody for joining me.	CHITCHAT
Hope you guys had fun in this loop so I don't know why it like doesn't look right now.	CHITCHAT
Whatever program is opening in but.	CHITCHAT
These are all designed to be looping animations.	CHITCHAT
They just loop infinitely so.	CHITCHAT
And then the very first when we started with was the constellations in the Northern Hemisphere movement across.	O
The skies opened up the CG for that one.	O
Teens get rotating around uh, this one was probably the most straightforward one that we did.	O
We literally just rotated the constellations around the Sky so.	O
Well, the fund shape, so we kind of kept the same style for everything.	O
Going on here, let me see.	CHITCHAT
He's already 4.	CHITCHAT
Of the Sky that we have supported from after effects so you can see like they're pretty much identical.	O
They probably won't be identical for our spaceman goggles, but.	O
Just the way it is.	O
Should be pretty close so.	O
That's everything you have got for now.	O
Thank you guys so much for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, there's like a billion.	CHITCHAT
Replay links in the description down below.	CHITCHAT
If you want to watch any of the, uh.	CHITCHAT
Previous videos for our space animation series.	CHITCHAT
I had a lot of fun doing it.	CHITCHAT
Like I said to learn.	CHITCHAT
Stuff a lot of stuff from about using after effects that kind of forgotten about or just like just haven't done in awhile so it's a good refresher for me and I think it was fun so you guys didn't ways to animate illustrator.	CHITCHAT
SVG is paying.	CHITCHAT
After effects, I know that probably like.	CHITCHAT
Flew through this stuff pretty quickly.	CHITCHAT
I don't know a lot of especially asking you stuff is pretty technical so apologies if it was a little bit overwhelming so you can always reach out to me and I will be more than happy to answer any questions you have.	CHITCHAT

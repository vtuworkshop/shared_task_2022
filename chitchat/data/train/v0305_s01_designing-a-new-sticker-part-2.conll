Kind of messed around and made another one, so I think this is this was the rough sketch and then I refined it a little bit.	O
Tips?	CHITCHAT
2.	CHITCHAT
This one and we changed the color.	O
Of the sketch using our uhm, Hue and saturation.	O
Um adjustments.	O
And then I made a base layer to block in the silhouette.	O
Then we added some different color variation on top of that.	O
An separate layers so we could easily change the color if we wanted to.	O
Which we did alot um.	O
And then I went ahead and I colored on top of the Lions.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
What have we done?	CHITCHAT
Need to delete this group?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I unclipped all my stuff.	O
We just need eclipse is back, so I colored the lines with clipping masks.	O
Kind of like I did with the colour um underneath.	O
And then we added a little bit of cleanup stuff, but mostly what we're going to do today is.	O
Figure out our lighting and then we're going to clean up.	O
Um on top of these lines, if I can find all my layers that I originally had visible.	O
Yeah, I think I think this is how it was.	O
OK so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we are going to go ahead and.	CHITCHAT
Group.	CHITCHAT
I'm just gonna group all of these together actually.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And this is our value check layer.	O
I kind of talked about this last time, so.	O
Uhm, you make a new layer an you fill it with white and then you set it to color and it will allow you to see the values without changing your entire image to black and white.	O
So you can like toggle this on and off so you can just kind of check and see if you have a good amount of contrast.	O
So uhm, yeah, this is kind of where we're going to start since I grouped all these together.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think what we're going to do is duplicate that group 'cause I don't want to lose the individual layers that I started with, so I'm going to go ahead and merge this together so if you press command E on Mac it'll go ahead and merge.	O
Those layers.	O
So now we have this on its own layer and we can proceed to play around with some.	O
Lighting up as far as like.	O
I'm not going to do really any dramatic lighting, it's just going to be some subtle lighting with blending modes.	O
And then I'll go on top of that with just a normal layer in paint.	O
Um, so I think I'll start out doing like a multiply.	O
And do some purple shadows because I think it will have some nice contrast with these oranges in here.	O
Come and try to find a color we want.	O
Pressure.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Trying to decide which breast I want to use right now.	O
Probably good, alright?	CHITCHAT
You guys can ask questions if you want to come or we can just kind of talk about whatever.	O
I haven't really drawn that much this week, 'cause I was working on a video which is exactly what I said last time.	O
Um, like the last stream.	O
Could, it was still the case this week.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I am still working on those videos were taking a very long time.	O
And it it was like I'm making a video about.	O

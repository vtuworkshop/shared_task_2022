Like my art journey.	CHITCHAT
So just talking about like when I started drawing and um.	CHITCHAT
Stuff about Lake Art School.	CHITCHAT
And like how I got into doing freelancing.	CHITCHAT
But it ended up being too long and I had to divide it into 2 videos, so um.	CHITCHAT
Part one of that.	CHITCHAT
Probably come out next week.	CHITCHAT
But I just thought it would be something like a good video to make, so a lot of people ask me those questions.	CHITCHAT
Like you think I should go to art school or like how did you start freelancing and like why did you decide to become an artist?	CHITCHAT
'cause I know like whenever I was trying to decide what I wanted to do I would listen to a lot of podcasts with artists interviews and they would really help me.	CHITCHAT
Kind of understand like what I what I wanted and.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Kind of the steps that I should take to get there.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
So I like this color down and I feel like I need a little bit more like purple tone in here.	O
Might end up deleting this, but it's OK, so we're going to use the.	O
Hue saturation.	O
Tool.	O
It's kind of coming here and trying to bump up this.	O
Saturation and maybe play around with the sliders a little bit.	O
toggle on and off the preview.	O
But I don't know if I'm really.	O
No, maybe I should just Oh no.	O
We're going to actually try this again on a normal layer.	O
A man just kind of see if we can get a good color.	O
For shadows in here, OK, I don't know why.	O
When I use a different brush actually.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Lower the opacity a little bit.	O
Just trying to find a good tone.	O
I don't want it to be 2 purple, I just wanted like.	O
Slightly.	O
Purple.	O
Let's see how.	CHITCHAT
I kind of look something like this down and then.	O
I will probably end up changing it like with the sliders and stuff.	O
I think this is a little bit.	O
2 White Now of course, just go in and kind of like erase out.	O
Some of the parts are like start to overlap with the lines.	O
I think it adds like a really nice like contrast between the colors in here.	O
I mean.	CHITCHAT
Even if it's really subtle.	O
Yeah, good.	CHITCHAT
'cause like that and we can go in, I'm going to use this chalk brush.	O
Um and erase.	O
Some of the.	O
Purple that ended up on the.	O
The lines.	O
On her hair up here.	O
I really like right now what we're trying to do is, uhm, just kind of like.	O
Lay down a hint of these colors because after I do everything that I want to do with the lighting, I'm going to go back and do a clean up player.	O
So we'll just end up painting on top of most of this anyway, so if it's like you know, right here, I just erased out some stuff.	O

Um, like more purple than I wanted to, but it's OK 'cause I'll just paint back over it and smooth everything out here in a minute.	O
So I think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I I like what I just did more than this so I'm going to delete that layer and we're going to try to do.	O
A little bit of.	O
Some.	CHITCHAT
Highlights maybe play around with.	O
Some kind of a color Dodge.	O
Nick are reddish orange.	O
I'm not sure yet.	CHITCHAT
A lot of this like the color or like the lighting stuff is mostly just me playing around with it and seeing like what I like.	O
I don't like that too much.	O
Since you orange.	O
But I'm just trying to look for that.	O
The color that I want early.	O
So we can just go in here and.	O
Move my sliders around.	O
Don't really like how saturated this is.	O
Specially in her hair, I feel like maybe I should do two different layers for her hair and her skin.	O
So it's very orangey.	O
Kind of to read.	O
So maybe I can just go in here and.	O
Select her hair.	O
Only an will play around with.	O
The highlight we want for her hair.	O
I kind of like a warm like Sun City Vive almost like.	O
Like Being in an Orchard at sunset or something, I don't know.	O
I'm also thinking of the print that I'm going to make to go with this.	O
'cause this is a sticker.	O
Design for UM, patrion and um.	O
It'll have like a matching sticker.	O
I mean a print that goes with it.	O
And it's going to be a her on a bike like riding through an Orchard.	O
I have yet to come up with the design for that, but.	O
Uhm, I have like my idea at least, and like I pin some references on Pinterest.	O
That's a start.	CHITCHAT
Right now.	CHITCHAT
Um, I'm liking this a little bit better.	O
I can't.	CHITCHAT
They want to move.	O
There was something about her eyes last time that I wanted to move, I think.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The shape was a little off to me, baby.	O
I keep noticing things.	O
I'm like, Oh yeah, I remember I was supposed to do that last time.	O
OK, I think it looks a little bit better.	O
Uhm, but I definitely seeing that these oranges right here, like this tone, is way too bright.	O
I don't know what happened.	O
With that Initially, but.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you Sarah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I really like all these brushes.	O
Uhm, I have him for my iPad as well, so it's like pretty much like what I use all the time.	O
And there's just like so many.	O
Um, like in the brush Packers like a ton.	O
I haven't even gotten a chance to play around with all of 'em yet, but I kind of have like the ones that I know that I really like.	O
So I tend to kind of use those a lot, like, um, to like these are the Jing sketch.	O
Complete collection brushes and I really like the sketch square brush.	O
It's nice like.	O
Uhm, well for sketching obviously, but I also do like wine working stuff with it too.	O
So that one is nice.	O
I found that I really like the pencil as well.	O
It's got like a really cool texture to it and like I don't even have Tim pressure on right there like.	O
Like I really nice texture on that one up and then for like shading and stuff.	O

The sharper underbrush.	O
It's got like a nice texture and you can make it like really smooth.	O
And then also like you'll see me use this edge control smooth alot 'cause it's got like a soft edge and a hard edge.	O
So it's really nice when you're blending and then this other edge control.	O
It's got more texture than edge control smooth so depending on like what I'm doing I'll use those.	O
And then I really like.	CHITCHAT
The flat square for sketching like really really loose sketching.	O
Oh yes, clean sketch is good too.	CHITCHAT
Very nice, I love it.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, um or we doing?	CHITCHAT
Give like looking back and forth.	O
Between my my computer screen on my tablet 'cause I wanna make sure the colors are looking.	O
Good.	CHITCHAT
But it's really just going to come together whenever we go in and do our like clean up.	O
I also need to go back here and do some kind of like a shadow on the oranges.	O
I think 1.	CHITCHAT
Do.	CHITCHAT
This edge control smooth on these we gotta decide like which ones in front, which ones behind.	O
Don't like that.	O
Don't like that color at all?	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I forgot to turn on my pen pressure.	O
And it's OK if it's messy here.	CHITCHAT
Because will fix all that in the cleanup.	O
I'm just trying to get like a hint of that color.	O
To Hennessey, like, does this work?	O
do I like this?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't think I've ever used this budget as I forgot they existed.	O
Actually I need to like look into using those.	O
I usually just like kind of blend with my brushes, so uhm, I don't really use any smudge tools anyways.	O
But That could be nice and I just don't know it.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I think before I go ahead and do any cleanup, I want to adjust the contrast as well.	O
So you want to bump up those values.	O
Make him pop a little bit more so we can go over here and um.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
So this is what I just did as far as contrast and we can look at.	O
R value check.	O
And well.	CHITCHAT
I think it will just erase what I just did.	O
Show my history, but we can do it again.	O
Um, so this is what it looks like now and.	O
I can adjust my values so.	O
We get a little bit more contrast.	O
I think this looks better like on the value.	O
And we can go back and compare.	O
Yeah, I think that definitely looks better.	O
Just go back and flip it on and off.	O
Even the shirt I think looks better like the tone of it.	O
It's good to always kind of like.	O
Check your value layer.	O

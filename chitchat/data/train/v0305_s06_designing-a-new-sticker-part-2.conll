And like my husband and I are playing it together, so we kind of got alike.	CHITCHAT
Wait on him or he's gotta wait on me.	CHITCHAT
That makes it kind of like harder to play, but.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, yeah, I'm excited to see what happens like.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people that I know I have already like either gotten through the game or they're like almost.	CHITCHAT
Done playing from like please do not spoil me.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying my best to get through it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I think this is where we are going to.	O
Start doing our clean up stuff.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
What happened?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Well, maybe not.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well hunts just not going to.	O
Let me have my pen pressure right now.	O
Anyways, we're going to make a new layer on top of all of these layers because we're going to be doing a lot of color picking and I think to start out I'm just going to use the chalk brushed like basic brush.	O
I think that just came with photo shop that I.	O
Have slightly modified.	O
Uhm, but basically, um.	O
This is just going to be a lot of jumping around in color picking, so I usually just kind of zoom in here and then if you press option when you have the brush tool select, it'll like switch it to the eye dropper.	O
And Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Well, you have to hold it down when you want the eyedropper to pop up.	O
But Um, so allow us just kind of like.	O
Quickly pick up the colors that are already on the canvas, 'cause I'm not.	O
I'm not doing any of like this and like what color do I want?	O
'cause I've kind of already decided that for the most part.	O
I mean sometimes I'll go back in and I'll pick a more intense color, but it's just basically.	O
Going through and.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
You know, getting rid of some of the sketch.	O
Lines coming in look like, you know this purple in here doing some some blending.	O
So it's basically like sculpting with paint.	O
So we're just trying to define.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
The painting a little bit more.	O
And you know, I.	O
I don't always clean up everything up because I feel like having some sketch lines in here.	O
Like it ends up like having a nice effect.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Wanna come in?	O
Maybe define some shapes, I guess is the.	O
The main thing that I'm doing.	O
I always want to, you know, hide.	O
Blair.	O
And see like OK?	CHITCHAT
Is this like?	CHITCHAT
Improving the shape of the improving the painting?	O
Or is it like hurting it?	O
Um, right here.	CHITCHAT
See with her nose.	O
It's like changing the shape of her nose.	O
So I'm not sure if what I did was.	O
Beneficial overall.	O
Like I like.	CHITCHAT
The clean up I did around her mouth, uhm, but just taking away this little bit.	O
Up there.	CHITCHAT
Change the whole shape.	O
It's like.	CHITCHAT
It made it look a lot different to me.	O
So that's something that I always kind of like.	O
Keep an eye on, just toggle on and Offen.	O
Try to stay consistent.	O
Say like true too.	O
The sketch and like what I liked about the sketch at the same time, like improving it as much as I can.	O

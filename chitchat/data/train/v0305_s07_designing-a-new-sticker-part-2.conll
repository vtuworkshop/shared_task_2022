So.	CHITCHAT
And sometimes I even like just lower the opacity a little bit.	O
But I'll usually do that towards the end.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's a big thing is like cleaning up around the features.	O
To make them more clear.	O
I like her eyes right here.	O
I didn't like fill them in like completely solid, which I mean.	O
I guess you don't have to, but it's just something.	O
That I find really helps with like contrast and.	O
Making Then look more finished.	O
You can also see like these this little line right here.	O
I don't want that in there.	CHITCHAT
Can it's distracting to me?	CHITCHAT
It's just like a matter of choosing like OK, what what's helping?	O
What's not helping?	CHITCHAT
Um, like the overall feel of the illustration.	O
And I do need to go out in and add some like shadow.	O
To her eyes also, I kind of talked about this last time, but originally I had, you know.	O
Sing Probably more of like this color.	O
For her eyes.	O
But since this is like a sticker illustration, I found that whenever you.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like whenever your coloring like the whites of the eyes rather than you know making them off white 'cause like you know what the shadows and everything.	O
They're not like white, uhm?	O
So what if I was doing an illustration?	O
I would tone them down a little bit, probably like.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Somewhere around this color, but uhm.	O
With a sticker, since whenever I cut the borders I'll show you.	O
For example, the slow guy will Pok√©mon double?	O
Uhm, I don't know if you guys can see this.	CHITCHAT
OK, so since.	CHITCHAT
The outline right here is white and it's going to be like a bright white.	O
Just based on like the way I cut it.	O
I I found that whenever I print them.	O
If I make the, uh, the whites of the eyes.	O
Like an off white, it looks really off.	O
When you compare it to the outline of the sticker so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
For my sticker designs, I usually keep them like a brighter white with some shadows in there.	O
Now I'm going to undo.	O
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I don't want to fight you.	O
When you don't do that, what happens with a one that I made?	O
For a patrion sticker, but this is one more.	O
I didn't adjust her eyes.	O
I don't know if you can really tell on the camera down here 'cause it's so small.	O
But her eyes look kind of like.	O
Pink.	O
Because I didn't change them to a brighter white, so I ended up like reprinting and.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Changing that.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's like my personal preference, but.	O
That's what I have started doing.	O
Instead of.	O
You know coloring the eyes like I normally do like?	O
Working Oh Keep moving the dock down on the wrong screen.	O
Just want to make sure it was keeping up with the chat.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So we I think I should pull some of this purple.	O
Make it like really light.	O
Translate that right here.	O

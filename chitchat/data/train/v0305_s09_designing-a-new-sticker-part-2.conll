I'm just trying to make sure that angles are like.	O
I know they kind of match up.	O
But I.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to come in and we're going to pull this green up from over here and we're going to try to find.	O
Good Hazel color.	O
Try it some very subtle who I like that a lot actually.	O
Um, I'll try to do this a little bit.	O
Right here.	CHITCHAT
So whenever you're painting eyes, you want to make sure that.	O
The colour part is on the opposite side of your highlight, or like the brightest part of the colored part of the eye is on the opposite side of the highlight because.	O
It's like.	CHITCHAT
Like your eyes, like a Dome.	O
So like the lights coming through and it's like hitting the opposite side.	O
And that's why it's like the brightest over there.	O
Mam I am like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why this is so I keep losing my pin pressure.	O
It's very frustrating.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm just trying to get a nice blend.	O
And here, and I don't want this to be too bright green.	O
I don't want to.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to be the same color as the leaves.	O
So I usually go back with like.	O
The black and I guess it's like a really dark Brown here, but.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Kind of do like a pushing pool of like.	O
The highlight.	O
How do you like a?	CHITCHAT
Almost like a blend like that.	O
Not sure how much I'm liking this though.	O
I don't know why this lagging.	O
Feel like I need to save.	O
Uhm, I like tablet.	O
Was lagging on me.	O
So basically I'm just like pulling this color in the background.	O
And I'm sculpting doing some.	O
Nice blend.	O
And here.	CHITCHAT
I'm also saying look at like this line right here.	O
Like see how affect this line is, and then it's like 2 things on this side.	O
So we want these to kind of like match.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make this a little bit more.	O

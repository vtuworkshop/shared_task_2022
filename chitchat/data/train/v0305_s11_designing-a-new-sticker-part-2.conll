Just a little bit.	O
Um, so right now, um question is what type of brushes are using?	O
Uhm, do you use for painting?	O
So right now I'm using just the default like chalk brush that.	O
I think I modified much.	O
It really needs to figure that out because people ask me a question.	O
I don't remember what I did to it, but I know originally it was a default brush on photo shop, but uhm.	O
I mainly use.	O
The Jing Sketch complete collection.	O
So I have those, um, I like a link to those brushes in the description of the live stream, but right now I'm just using this other one.	O
To use it to like, clean up around the lines and stuff.	O
It sounds like my favorite for a long time.	O
Actually used to use this brush for pretty much everything like lines color like.	O
Absolutely everything, but I've since like.	O
Branched out and started using different brushes.	O
I just found that like.	O
Sounds like really good for.	O
Smoothing things out.	O
After you already have things like laid down.	O
But I mean, I'm not going to do like her hair with this brush and I probably won't do like the leaves are the oranges.	O
I'm just going to use it for like her skin.	O
Her features.	O
Just to kind of blend some things in.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I'll use like a more textured brush for everything else from the jinx sketch brushes.	O
Like this chalk brush.	O
It's like smooth enough to where you know you can blend, but at the same time it's like.	O
Not the soft brush and it has like a little bit.	O
Can you change my color so I can show you?	O
So it's got.	CHITCHAT
You A little bit of this like texture on the ends, so it's like a brush stroke.	O
I don't know why it's called Chuck if it looks like this, but.	O
I think it like layers nicely.	O
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
But I think I have like this brush on Patris on for free.	O
Maybe um.	O
I don't remember which ones I've uploaded.	O
It's like I think it's.	O
If it's on there, it's like free to download, even if you're not a patron, just like it was easy to just upload it there.	O
For people to download.	O
Rather than like I don't even know where else I would put it.	O
Mom.	CHITCHAT
Just about done with her face.	O
Usually when I rotate things back I just do it where I hold the shift.	O

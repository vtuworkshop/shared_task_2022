But it's got funded like super early on, so it's really exciting.	CHITCHAT
But I'll be teaching a class on there.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure exactly when it will be available though.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But I know it's like this year, I think.	CHITCHAT
Supposed to like everything supposed to be out.	CHITCHAT
There's like 10 new courses being added.	CHITCHAT
So I've been doing a lot of work on that and.	CHITCHAT
Sleep more personal video projects like YouTube stuff.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like YouTube stuff is mainly like for patrons.	CHITCHAT
Because they get like credits in the videos and stuff.	CHITCHAT
So they like sponsor the channel.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I'll make like tutorials and things.	CHITCHAT
Like advice videos on YouTube?	CHITCHAT
And then I'll make like.	CHITCHAT
You know slept supplemental material and Post that on.	CHITCHAT
Think Patreons, I've been doing, um.	CHITCHAT
Like I made two videos this month and like it actually turned into three videos that I'm working on, 'cause I had to split one of them into 2.	CHITCHAT
Which I know I mentioned at the beginning of the video.	CHITCHAT
But uhm, yeah, been like working on those a lot.	CHITCHAT
I just feel like I haven't really like.	CHITCHAT
Drawn anything that wasn't for.	CHITCHAT
A video of it and like you know, working on this.	CHITCHAT
Right now, but.	CHITCHAT
No, I have to do the like print that matches this.	CHITCHAT
And also I'll end up streaming that like later this week.	CHITCHAT
Probably early on this week, actually.	CHITCHAT
Looking probably Tuesday.	CHITCHAT
But I need to like sketch it out and get my idea down before.	CHITCHAT
I continue with it because I don't want to be like trying to like talk to you guys on the stream and then.	CHITCHAT
Freaking out about how the drawings not going the way I wanted to.	CHITCHAT
So I I kind of like to have something prepared.	CHITCHAT
I guess with this one we I kind of started something beforehand and then.	CHITCHAT
I ended up completely scrapping it and we started over and then.	CHITCHAT
Kind of worked on this one together.	CHITCHAT
Well, I like how this one is turning out.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Dino card I'm very bad at drawing cars.	O
I mean, I don't really.	O
I haven't really had an instance where I had to try drawing a car.	O
Like legit try like any car that I've ever drawn in my life.	O
It's probably been just for like.	O
I don't know, like Pictionary, maybe like if I were to draw a car right now, I would.	O
Probably do something like this.	O
Sounds like it doesn't make sense.	O
It's like a child car.	O
This is how I'm gonna come by car.	O
Ever since I was a kid.	O
Just like forward the doors here maybe.	O
Black window here's another door.	O
Yeah, it looks like.	O
Both sides are the same.	O
It's not good.	CHITCHAT
But it's OK 'cause I haven't put any practice into drawing cards, so that's why it looks so bad.	O
It's like if you don't, you don't put in the time to work on something you're not instantly going to be good at drawing it.	O
I feel like that's.	O
It's a struggle that a lot of people have like.	O
You know I have a video on YouTube talking about.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like growing your Instagram and I know a lot of people in the comment.	O
Are mostly complaining about how.	O
Hum, they're having a hard time growing their Instagram or like.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
People are like I've done all these things and I just can't do it.	O
Flickr they're giving up too early, and they're not putting.	O
Enough time into it or something, um.	O
But I think it's the same thing with like.	O

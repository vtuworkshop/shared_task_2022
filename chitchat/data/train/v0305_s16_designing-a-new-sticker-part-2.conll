Learning to draw us people get really discouraged about.	CHITCHAT
You know, like I'm trying to draw this thing and you know it doesn't look good.	CHITCHAT
I don't like it, it's like, well, it's probably 'cause you haven't like drawn it enough.	CHITCHAT
I think people give up too easily.	CHITCHAT
I mean, there's like a lot of instances where I'm.	CHITCHAT
They will be drawing.	CHITCHAT
Something, even if it's like something I draw all the time like people just feel like man, I don't like this.	CHITCHAT
This doesn't look good and then.	CHITCHAT
I know that's when I need to put in some practice time and.	CHITCHAT
Work on drawing from life.	CHITCHAT
Rather than just kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Making things up.	CHITCHAT
So rather than seeing it as like, Oh Man, I'm failing like this.	CHITCHAT
Looks bad.	CHITCHAT
It's more of like a sign like hey you need to.	CHITCHAT
Can you take a look at this?	CHITCHAT
At least that's how I see it.	CHITCHAT
Let's see reading the chat.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Oh any vehicle?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm bad at drawing any vehicles.	O
I mean that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what else I would do differently if I drew like that were like.	O
A truck other than make the truck bed like long.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I like a semi truck, just draw big box in the end I don't know.	O
I haven't tried.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think like.	CHITCHAT
And the only way to get better at drawing like cars is to look at them and try to like.	O
Observe.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, and then try to draw it like they're very angular and I like drawing like organic shapes more so I think that's why I don't really enjoy them.	O
They have to be like, really.	CHITCHAT
Precise I guess.	CHITCHAT
Or like even pretty symmetrical on each side, like in order for them to function.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Coming along.	O
I think I'm going to take some of this, like purple color and.	O
Someone her shirt down here too.	O
Blend this in so we have some kind of a shadow color.	O
Down here as well.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
It's like.	CHITCHAT
It's a lot like drawing is a lot about like what you choose to put your time into, like which path do you want to take like?	O
I like to draw people they used to draw like a lot of dogs and like animals and stuff when I was in high school, but I didn't really draw people too much so I didn't like.	O
Improve my drawings of people.	O
Um, as fast as you know, I would now when I draw people more like what do you put your time into?	O
Like skill trees or something?	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Like in a video game.	O
Front There's so many different things that.	O
Like so many different things to learn.	O
Like drawing a background is completely different than you know.	O
Drawing a person or like a character.	O
And that's kind of like what my.	O
My thesis was about in college like my senior project.	O
I didn't really draw environments like hardly at all.	O
And my whole like project was about like building a visual Library of things that I knew how to draw.	O

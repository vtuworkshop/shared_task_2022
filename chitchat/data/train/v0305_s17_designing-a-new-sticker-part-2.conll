So the only thing like the only way to practice and like get better at more things to draw more things.	O
Like try to draw different things.	O
So it was like me, um, destroying different environments and.	O
Um, different kinds of settings.	O
Just trying to improve overall at like composition.	O
How to draw myself?	O
In those drawings.	O
Um, and it was supposed to be like a reflection of like.	O
Like, OK, so if I was wrong and environment an I really struggled with it.	O
I would draw myself in a way that reflected that like how I felt about the drawing and how difficult it was.	O
Like one drawing in particular, I was like a kind of a snow scene and I was having a lot of trouble with the composition, so you know, I drew myself like.	O
Walking in like a snowstorm and like you know, covering my face from the snow and stuff.	O
So it was like.	CHITCHAT
There is more of a struggle and then there are other ones where it was like, Um, I felt a lot more comfortable.	O
Like with environments towards the end of my thesis project.	O
So I drew myself like casually like hiking through like a forest.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
But I talk about like.	O
In my video that some, well, I guess the second part won't come out for a little while, but I'm making the.	O
A video about like my art journey.	O
I kind of talk about that and like.	O
Whenever I was in college, I goes unhappy with.	O
School and stuff and like just.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, he's fine art in school as they didn't have like an illustration program or any kind of like visual development.	O
Stuff and I.	O
I wasn't even able to use my like I couldn't do digital art for my assignments.	O
I would always have to like work in charcoal or like paint or something like that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Until like the end of college I guess.	O
But that was like really frustrating, like not being able to do exactly what I wanted to do for school, and there were no classes that taught.	O
Digital art.	O
It's like I've always learned from.	O
I just kind of like doing it or like trying tutorials and stuff.	O
But Like I couldn't even like draw cartoons like at school.	O
Frustrating.	O
Hum, but because of that.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Like seek out the information that I want to learn now rather than just kind of saying like.	O
Or like.	CHITCHAT
Having it be um, taught like in a class.	O
Like in person kind of thing.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I do a lot of like.	O
Um, like experimenting with, you know, different brushes, different techniques and stuff.	O
Just trying to.	O
Find different ways of painting.	O
And I don't think I would be that way if.	O
I wasn't like initially unhappy with school.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's all like articulated, better in my videos are making now.	O
It's just like a lot to think about.	O
It was like a hard time.	O
For me.	CHITCHAT
Gone through school.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I think after I.	O
Go ahead and add these oranges, reckon here.	O
I'm gonna move onto, probably.	O
Think I'll do the oranges in the background first.	O
We're going to go back to the pencil brush.	O

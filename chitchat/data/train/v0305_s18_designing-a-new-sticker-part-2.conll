And I'm going to go in here and just kind of draw these oranges back in.	O
Since I painted on top of them.	O
I thank you Brendan, Brendan.	CHITCHAT
Sorry Um, I'm glad you like my videos.	CHITCHAT
There are making videos like.	CHITCHAT
Probably like a year and a half ago now.	CHITCHAT
Thing I posted my first video.	CHITCHAT
Like December 2018.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I don't remember, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's like.	CHITCHAT
I've changed like a lot since then, like as far as like.	CHITCHAT
Being more comfortable with making videos 'cause I used to be like.	CHITCHAT
Very shy.	CHITCHAT
I'm still like kind of like that, but.	CHITCHAT
Not as much like if you would have told me a year and a half ago, I'd be streaming.	CHITCHAT
Right now I would not have believed you.	CHITCHAT
Like even helped me like with writing.	CHITCHAT
Laugh like emails just because after like writing scripts.	CHITCHAT
For my videos.	CHITCHAT
Like sometimes I'll write out like a full.	CHITCHAT
Script like with these past two videos I like really went into detail.	CHITCHAT
With the script but.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I just kind of like right down the main points and just talk, but I finally that is a little bit harder than.	CHITCHAT
Having everything kind of thought out beforehand because sometimes I like start reading are all I start talking and then I forget like what I just said so I have to like.	CHITCHAT
Redo it.	CHITCHAT
And it's usually like if I keep messing up and I keep saying things over and over again.	CHITCHAT
I'm like, wait, what?	CHITCHAT
What all did I just say here?	CHITCHAT
Buffalo have a struggle sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Fine.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm like finally starting to get my audio to sound better too, because.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I've had some like even recently.	CHITCHAT
I've had some people say, like, hey, I can't hear you like it's muffled and stuff, and I mean I can play it on my phone and it's like not muffled so I don't know.	CHITCHAT
What's going on with that?	CHITCHAT
But I was using the audio from my phone.	CHITCHAT
Like recording, so I like record the video and audio on my phone and I was just using that but this?	CHITCHAT
But the past two videos that aren't that I made that aren't up yet, um?	CHITCHAT
I did use like my mic that I got.	CHITCHAT
Like with the boom arm and everything, so hopefully they sound better.	CHITCHAT
But I'm still kind of like figuring out like editing and stuff with those.	CHITCHAT
I think it might be beneficial if I work a headset.	CHITCHAT
When I was editing.	CHITCHAT
Rather than just like using the computer sound, but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Still learning this is like.	CHITCHAT
Like video stuff is something I've always done, just kind of like casually like Oh my gosh, wonder whenever I was probably in like fifth grade.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it wasn't video stuff exactly, but I loved making power points.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I would just like.	CHITCHAT

Play Animal Crossing villagers like my favorite ones.	CHITCHAT
I would give him their own page in a PowerPoint can make like a gradient like one of those like really ugly, like a default gradients.	CHITCHAT
Or you can just change the color.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, I just remembered that I did that but I would just to just play those and be like hey look this is the power point I made of my favorite Animal Crossing villagers.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I mean it's not exactly video, but I've always liked to do like little.	CHITCHAT
Things like that or like uhm?	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but.	CHITCHAT
Whenever I got photo shop uhm.	CHITCHAT
For like the first version of photo shop that I had, which was some elements five, it came with like premiere.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Adobe Premier, that's what it is, yes.	CHITCHAT
And I would use that to make little videos that were like almost like a scrapbook.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but I didn't do anything like with art.	CHITCHAT
It was mostly like.	CHITCHAT
Um, making like.	CHITCHAT
Presents for people like I made I made a video for my mom with Adobe premiere that was like a scrapbook uhm?	CHITCHAT
I'm just like pictures and stuff from like 1 near my brother will little and it was like from when we were little up until like.	CHITCHAT
Like now, well, I mean not now, but like I think it was 2009 when they made that and um.	CHITCHAT
The video is like 45 minutes long and I was like.	CHITCHAT
Probably never going to watch this again.	CHITCHAT
Way too long video.	CHITCHAT
We just sat there for a really long time.	CHITCHAT
Like yeah this is.	CHITCHAT
This is the video I made you.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but I've never really done anything like.	CHITCHAT
Before now, like professionally with video, so it's all it's like a learning experience.	CHITCHAT
Like even more so than, like with Art, 'cause Arts like the thing that I chose that I'm going to get better at and I'm going to work on this and videos just kind of like this is fun.	CHITCHAT
And now I do it like.	CHITCHAT
Professionally, but I'm still learning about like sound and.	CHITCHAT
Editing and all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
But I really like.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I like adding like effects and stuff to videos.	CHITCHAT
As far as like.	CHITCHAT
You know tags and like doing the transitions and stuff and playing around with different things.	CHITCHAT
I really need to learn to use after effects, so seeing people do like really cool things with that.	CHITCHAT
And I have that like with my flight creative cloud subscription.	CHITCHAT
I just don't know anything about it.	CHITCHAT
So I think I don't know that could be fun to play around with and.	CHITCHAT
Learn how to use.	CHITCHAT
I think I could do some cool stuff with the.	CHITCHAT
Like program for.	CHITCHAT
Like my YouTube videos and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Just need to figure out how to use it.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry guys, I have not been looking at the chat um.	CHITCHAT
You went to school for animation.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I totally feel that it's like you spend like at least two years doing like stuff that you feel like it's a waste of time I mean, I feel like the only thing that I really enjoyed doing was like figure drawing and I felt like that helped me a lot.	CHITCHAT
But um, since I want to like.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't like it completely like Art School is like the University of Louisville, so it was like A.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Uh, like a University really had like a bunch of different degrees other than just like art degrees and I had to take like a bunch of other classes like.	CHITCHAT
Had to take general classes for like years before I could just focus on art.	CHITCHAT
And it was like stuff like astronomy.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't remember anything about that other than it was a very hard class and my teacher had to curve the grades.	CHITCHAT
Grades like 2 grades up because everybody did so bad in his class.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh Just saying I'm.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I would have gotten AD in that class.	CHITCHAT

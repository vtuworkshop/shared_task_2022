'cause I understood.	CHITCHAT
Kind of how things fit together and like.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I had like a sense of proportion and stuff, but.	CHITCHAT
Just taking like an anatomy for artists class.	CHITCHAT
Like completely changed everything.	CHITCHAT
But the way that that class is structured like.	CHITCHAT
We broke down.	CHITCHAT
Like certain sections like we wouldn't do like a whole like class about or we would like break up, you know, from your shoulder to this for your arm and then from this part of your arm to your wrist and then like your hand instead of doing like there's a whole arm that would be very, very focused in.	CHITCHAT
And what we do is we have.	CHITCHAT
I think we would do.	CHITCHAT
Half the Class I don't quite remember, it's been like.	CHITCHAT
Warriors, yeah, probably like 4 years but uh, we would do half the class where we would watch like.	CHITCHAT
Um, like videos and like take notes and do like a lecture part.	CHITCHAT
And then I think the other half of the class.	CHITCHAT
Or was either like.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it was the next class.	CHITCHAT
We would do, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Like figure drawing, but we'd only focus on.	CHITCHAT
That part.	CHITCHAT
Send the body so very, very focused in and then we kind of like do assignments that would bring everything together.	CHITCHAT
So I think that was like the best way to approach.	CHITCHAT
Learning and we didn't like.	CHITCHAT
Go into detail with like muscles that you can't see because it's not really important for artists like you want to take a look at the muscles on the surface more than.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like The ones that are.	CHITCHAT
Like further down.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, come come back.	CHITCHAT
Pain, pressure and miss you.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think it's really important to learn that even if you're not going to do like anatomically correct, like completely anatomically correct characters like you.	CHITCHAT
Even if your stylizing things a lie, it's important to learn 'cause it will help you like a whole lot.	CHITCHAT
I promise if you just learn.	CHITCHAT
Basic Anatomy.	CHITCHAT
Comes from there.	CHITCHAT
You can like if you understand and then you like.	CHITCHAT
Exaggerate that it'll like.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it just clicks better.	CHITCHAT
When you're when you're drawing just kind of like understand.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's my spiel on.	CHITCHAT
Taken classes like that.	CHITCHAT
But I do feel like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I remember.	CHITCHAT
My.	CHITCHAT
2D like.	CHITCHAT
Drawing class my very first drawing class uhm.	CHITCHAT
My teacher was like.	CHITCHAT
She told me I should have tested out of it.	CHITCHAT
I'm like why am I here?	CHITCHAT
I'm paying for this and you're telling me I shouldn't be here.	CHITCHAT
She's like if I was on the board that year, you wouldn't have to take this class like well, thanks.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate it, I'm still here though.	CHITCHAT
So I already had like experience with like drawing with.	CHITCHAT
And charcoal and um.	CHITCHAT
Like drawing from life.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of the people in the class that was like their very first time like drawing still life or like anything.	CHITCHAT
Um, figure drawing related.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I guess that was more money for them.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I also had to take like a 3D class.	CHITCHAT
I'm like.	CHITCHAT
So bad at thinking in well, I mean like I, I try to think in 3D when I'm drawing in 2D but like.	CHITCHAT

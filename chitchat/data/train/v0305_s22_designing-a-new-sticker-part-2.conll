I don't really like sculpting and.	CHITCHAT
Um, stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
We had to make a.	CHITCHAT
Like plaster mold thing where we filled up like a milk jug with plaster and then you like cut the milk jug off of it.	CHITCHAT
And it was just like the shape and then we had to like chisel away at this thing.	CHITCHAT
And it's like if you hit it too hard.	CHITCHAT
It's like going to crack.	CHITCHAT
So you have to be really careful.	CHITCHAT
And I ended up doing a little sculpture of my dog.	CHITCHAT
Marley, yeah, I still have it at my dad's house, actually.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So that was really difficult.	CHITCHAT
Um took like a photography class that was actually cool.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I like photography, but we did film photography and.	CHITCHAT
We got these little like black-and-white cameras.	CHITCHAT
To like we had like rent one from the school and by our own film.	CHITCHAT
So I learned how to like process.	CHITCHAT
Or like develop I guess film?	CHITCHAT
Um, which I remember the first roll of film that I did um, like we were supposed to.	CHITCHAT
Um, like we had a partner that we were assigned or I guess we get to pick our partners but.	CHITCHAT
I didn't have one 'cause I didn't know anybody in the class, so I got assigned a partner and um.	CHITCHAT
We were supposed to go like in the darkroom, and you're supposed to like wind your film up on this little like it looks like a spool.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but my film got exposed because my partners watch lit up and it messed up my film.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't completely ruined but it was like really upset because I uhm.	CHITCHAT
The assignment was to do kind of like a scavenger hunt like we were given a piece of paper that had like.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Things to like take pictures of.	CHITCHAT
I mean, you could get like creative with it or whatever, but there was something on the list was like, um.	CHITCHAT
Like underwater or something.	CHITCHAT
I don't know exactly what it was, but.	CHITCHAT
I'm dumb and I actually took my phone 'cause it had one of those LifeProof cases and I put it in the water and like a big bowl.	CHITCHAT
and I tried to take a picture of it with the screen on.	CHITCHAT
so I thought like maybe it would have a cool kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Distorted effect.	CHITCHAT
And I took the phone out of the water and it had water in the case and was like Oh no, no, no no, no no like I messed up so bad.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but it turns out like the case on the little like.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, my phone doesn't have anymore, but I like little home button thing on the iPhone.	CHITCHAT
On the case that had like a little, um plastic.	CHITCHAT
Thing on top of it and it was like held on by a little bit of glue on the inside of the the case and it had come loose when I was cleaning it.	CHITCHAT
Um, so the water leaks in that way, and my phone, um?	CHITCHAT
Died after that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I like trying to put it in rice and everything and do all the stuff that people are like hey, you should do this and it might fix your phone and it was OK for a little bit actually.	CHITCHAT
And then it stopped charging or not overheated when I was charging.	CHITCHAT
Puppies are puppies are barking.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what they're barking at.	CHITCHAT
Hold on guys.	CHITCHAT
1 second Sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
My puppies were barking there in here now though.	CHITCHAT
I love you.	CHITCHAT
This is Marley, by the way.	CHITCHAT
The one that I did the sculpture of.	CHITCHAT
He was not working 'cause he's he's a good boy but.	CHITCHAT
Is it vocally and he was barking because he's a puppy and he?	CHITCHAT

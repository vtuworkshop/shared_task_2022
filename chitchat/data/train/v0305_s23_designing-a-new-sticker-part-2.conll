He doesn't know any better I guess.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you very good.	CHITCHAT
He's looking right at the camera.	CHITCHAT
OK, well let you down so we can keep drawing OK.	CHITCHAT
Please are you boy?	CHITCHAT
Oakley is going to be 10 months old on let's wealth, yes.	CHITCHAT
So he's 9 1/2 months old and Marley is 11.	CHITCHAT
How?	CHITCHAT
I think they'll be a little bit more content in here though, 'cause I think I think my husband went outside.	CHITCHAT
So Oakley was probably barking at him.	CHITCHAT
And wanting to carry out.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think so yeah, my phone.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I broke.	CHITCHAT
Eventually it died slowly after I come.	CHITCHAT
Like put it in the water so.	CHITCHAT
Is rough.	CHITCHAT
I just couldn't believe that.	CHITCHAT
I did something so dumb.	CHITCHAT
But really, the case should have protected it and after that I have not gotten another one of their cases.	CHITCHAT
Like the LifeProof ones.	CHITCHAT
Just got phone insurance instead.	CHITCHAT
Marley stop licking your toes.	CHITCHAT
That's why they weren't inherent initially.	CHITCHAT
Marley has been licking his feet alot.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I guess he always says that today it's been particularly annoying.	CHITCHAT
You're right, Bob.	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
I used to have his like dog bed up on my desk like where my centriq is now so he's always like walking up to me like me like hey can I get on my little perch and like sorry dude I can't.	CHITCHAT
I don't have enough room anymore.	CHITCHAT
I try to put them up like over here on this side of my desk, but.	CHITCHAT
He I don't know like if I put Marley up there then Oakley wants out there and.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oakley doesn't like to sit still all the time.	CHITCHAT
But usually Marley doesn't want to be like too close to Oakley anyway.	CHITCHAT
So I think it's good that they just kind of like chill on the floor.	CHITCHAT
Plus it doesn't get so hot down there.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
It's coming along, we are.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
About to move on and work on her hair.	O
After I get all these little leaves done.	O
Trying to add a little bit of detail on them.	O
Before I.	O
Or from the hair.	O
Really need to make some time to do some more like.	O
I like life stream um.	O
Like screams like my stream starting soon thing like I need a be right back in case you know something like.	O
Um, what happened?	O
What just happened happens and I have to go to like get the dogs or anything to drink or something.	O
I don't have another.	O

Those are only makes sense if I make it say like stream starting soon.	O

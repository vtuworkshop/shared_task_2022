Some brighter highlights in here.	O
With a little shiny.	O
I'll probably put some more like.	O
Blending mode layers on top.	O
Have all these.	O
Just to get the final kind of lighting effect.	O
But I want.	O
But that will come after I am done with clean up and everything 'cause I'll end up.	O
Probably merging these all together in a little group.	O
This is kind of what I was talking about.	O
As far as like the values like these two values right here.	O
They look very, very similar, so.	O
What we need to do is either put like a stronger highlight on this lease.	O
Or, uhm, dark enough the shadow.	O
So I think I'm going to.	O
Kind of adding some.	O
And yellow green highlight.	O
Probably going into that too.	O
Most of the leaves actually feel like that all.	O
So it's nice.	CHITCHAT

Do you are here?	O
Uhm, I do want it to be.	O
I want it to be sketchy and textured uhm.	O
So I'm going to leave like some of the details, but I don't know about these little like.	O
Um curls on the outside.	O
I think I might redo them so I might have to go in and.	O
Let's interesting, this is all the stuff that I've added through the bottom sketch.	O
Click a little math.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Everything that I've painted on top of.	O
Uh, but I'm going to go ahead and make a new layer, and I think I'm going to continue using the same brush quickly.	O
No no.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully the Barker.	O

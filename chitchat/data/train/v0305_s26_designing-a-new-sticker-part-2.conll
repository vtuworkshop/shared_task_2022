Like looking up at me.	O
I want to go get it.	O
Hopefully.	CHITCHAT
Good boy, thank you.	CHITCHAT
We're playing a game the other day.	CHITCHAT
It was like A.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like a diner, kind of like VR game and whenever like a new customer walked in the door Bell would ring a man.	CHITCHAT
Oakley would freak out every single time, uhm?	CHITCHAT
He did that probably like 10 times and I think he caught on.	CHITCHAT
Nobody was actually at the door.	CHITCHAT
So he stopped, so maybe that's the way to teach him.	CHITCHAT
Like hey, you gotta calm down.	CHITCHAT
Actually going to come.	CHITCHAT
Colour these oranges first on like another layer.	O
Kurt, your rings.	O
Because they're just fighting bothering me.	O
I don't like the colors that I chose this orange right here is like.	O
Way too saturated.	O
I do not know what I'm thinking.	O
I'm just going to block in this entire like shape.	O
Now I think I'm gonna do.	O
I'm gonna fill in the entire earring shape so we don't see any of the color that I originally had down.	O
And Uhm.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to set it to like a pixel lock Alpha lock kind of thing.	O
So we can just not have to worry about anything else outside of wines.	O
Surprise, that actually worked.	O
OK, so we basically have.	O
The shape of the earring.	O
Call Can I go back?	O
On the layer underneath this and like clean up.	O
And the kind of outside parties that I didn't want to include.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Well, just kind of make these.	O
More circular.	O
Just want them to be like consistent.	O
I think this one looks pretty good.	O
This one might be a little too dumb.	O
Too big on the side.	O
And trim that down.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Go back on this layer underneath.	O
Do.	CHITCHAT
A little bit more of that won't stop honey.	O
Please can you please stop?	CHITCHAT
Pizza.	CHITCHAT
OK, thank you.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Really.	CHITCHAT
He's not even looking at like licking his feet staring right at me and just like.	CHITCHAT
Really.	CHITCHAT

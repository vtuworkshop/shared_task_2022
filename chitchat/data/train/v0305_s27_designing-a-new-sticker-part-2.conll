Zoomed in Um, I'm going to outline this.	O
Marley please please stop.	CHITCHAT
Please.	CHITCHAT

I don't think I would be very happy though.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
See Have you ever wanted to change the styles and do something completely different from what you usually do?	O
Like make a horror piece?	O
Uhm, I do like to try like.	O
Pushing shapes sometimes like but something that I want to come.	O
Actually get better at like.	CHITCHAT
Feel like I.	CHITCHAT
Like from my experience doing like fine art stuff and college has really uhm made me fall back on like anatomy as like a default.	O
And that's exactly what I want to do.	O
Like I want to stylize things even more uhm?	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Work on like more bold shapes and just kind of like.	O
Push my style in the direction I want it to go in.	O
And I just feel like.	O
You know, sometimes it's just like going through the motions and like I'm still creating art and stuff, but I'm not really trying to focus on that all the time, so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like I tend to default back to um, like my style that I want my style to evolve and.	O
I don't like.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't do like a horror piece because.	O
I don't like scary things, uhm?	O
Like I have a hard time playing the Last of Us sometimes but.	O
You know we work through it.	O
Um, for this story.	O
But Yeah, it's just like I don't know I I don't like scary movies and stuff so wouldn't do like horror themed.	O
But I mean I don't know I've drawn.	O
Like Things that weren't link cute before.	O
Uhm, I mean I do like drawing cute things.	O
My favorite but.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I don't know like I really like bio shock and I've drawn like bio shock fan art and it had like.	O
Blood, but I mean.	O
Not typically what I draw.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
So I mean, I guess it was kind of horror, but I don't think I ever finished that drawing that was working on so.	O
Nobody's ever seen it.	O
That was a long time ago there.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I haven't really like seen too much about cyberpunk.	O
Uhm, I remember like seeing the initial trailer like years ago from E3, but Um?	O
I hardly kept up with it.	O

Some kind of looking at my computer screen I think maybe they are a little bit too yellow though.	O
Maybe not I don't know.	O
Well, just go ahead and merge this.	O
And then we'll.	O
Play with some sliders.	O
OK, now it to dedicate some time to her hair.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I think we'll play around with some rush.	O
Is trying to figure out which one I want to use.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
We want trays though.	O
The pencil 1 first.	O
Trying to get this overall shape.	O
1st.	CHITCHAT
And then come in and kind of make the rest of like the inside part like match that.	O
It's like silhouette is very important.	O
Especially like when you're designing a sticker.	O
You want to have like a good silhouette shape.	O
Um, so it looks nice when you like cut it.	O
Also wanna give her some little curlies.	O
Come over here.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not like that though.	O
I like the way these are over here.	O
I just don't like the brush that I used.	O
I think I made them.	O
Like not textured enough.	O
To match with the rest of her hair.	O
So I think maybe.	O
I'm playing around doing stuff like this.	O
Might help.	CHITCHAT
Then I'll just kind of repeat this kind of.	O
Texture on the other side.	O
Z.	CHITCHAT
Trying to really capture the texture I'm looking for.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Have a reference pulled up.	O
Some things that same uhm, like.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Hairstyle hurt like the picture I'm looking at her hairs and down but it's the same kind of texture that I'm trying to achieve.	O
To see.	CHITCHAT
Tight little curls Hum.	O
I think when you're like drawing her, the most important thing to look at first is just overall.	O
Shape and then going back in here and like breaking it up.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Will really help a look like.	O
You can see here, like you know we've got here will change color and so on.	O
Top of this right here.	O
We've got this overall shape, but we're thinking about it in 3D, so this is where the light is catching right here.	O
And then under here is like shadow, so it's more like.	O
You know a 3D kind of shape, and you're thinking about like overall like planes like where the lights going to hit and it's kind of like.	O
Coming under here.	O
Uhm, but.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's kind of how I try to think of her.	O
Because.	O
They help set Canada.	O
No, no look more like a form and not look so flat 'cause you don't want to like go in and do like.	O
Every single strand of hair.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
That looks too busy, so you want to kind of get the overall shape in the overall like.	O

Shadows, and so I'm just coming in here with this brush.	O
Kinda some texture lines in here.	O
To get the overall.	O
Kind of like shape.	O
And like little lines like this one right here.	O
You want to get rid of that because it doesn't.	O
It doesn't make sense with the overall.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Shape 'cause we've got her hair.	O
Coming this way.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And this one is like it's going down.	O
It's like, well, that doesn't really make sense with the rest of the form.	O
So that's another thing you want to think about.	O
It's almost like it's being, uh.	O
Counterintuitively, Blake.	O
Just add, not.	O
Alright is counterproductive.	O
It's nothing with your.	O
Overall shape.	O
I think like what I've added so far, had like totally changed like all the texture thing.	O
It's like really coming in, um, can see.	O
Like instead of being one flat plane of highlight.	O
You can see like the dips and how it's like.	O
Little girl.	O
So I think we're heading in the right direction with that for sure.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Am I also I keep a little window up here like Navigator window but like right now I'm looking at my computer screen as well and it's like zoomed out more.	O
So, uhm.	O
It helps if you kind of like.	O
Look at the big picture.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like back and forth between Lincoln zoomed in version in the big picture because you can see your overall.	O
The overall shape of what you're doing better.	O
Especially like with her.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I think other than adding like a little bit more texture and here and helping these shapes little bit, I think.	O
Most done, um.	O
Like I said, I want to keep some of the sketch lines in here.	O
They feel like they help with the overall texture of it.	O
I think maybe we need to pull some dark shadows in here to to help with the like depth.	O
Specially like down here.	O
And then like by her neck.	O
So it'll be the darkest down here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
The only part over here that I'm seeing as like.	O

Darker areas.	O
We also need to look at these little sketch lines too, 'cause they're doing the same things the other ones were doing.	O
Am I going in the wrong direction?	O
Oh Sometimes I accidentally like click buttons and I'm like I don't know what I'm doing and then it's like something's not working and I'll look at my other screen and.	O
Something weird.	CHITCHAT
Like a shortcut?	O
I didn't even know existed.	O
Like I was trying to make a new layer.	O
I think maybe I need to.	O
Really zoom out in like.	O
Try flipping the canvas.	O

Sometimes we have trouble with that.	O
Before I started streaming, I had to go back and take a look at my.	O
My screen colors 'cause I felt like my um Photoshop window.	O
It looked more green than normal.	O
So I had to look at that and.	O

Nope.	CHITCHAT
Understand.	CHITCHAT
Come on, I need me to be able to use this.	O
Why is it not working?	CHITCHAT
So annoying, I don't know why it does that.	CHITCHAT
It's probably annoying hearing about how annoying it is, but.	O
You don't know.	O
Trying to get through it.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to walk any Flowers real quick, and then we're going to.	O
Going to make it into any cigarette.	O
So these are like the little Flowers that.	O
Are on the oranges or on the trees for the.	O
The oranges come in.	O
So they're supposed to be at least.	O
I'm like really bad at drawing Flowers.	O
Or at least like a struggle before they like actually start to look OK.	O
Can you pull up my a little reference that I had before?	O
I actually block these in because I don't want them.	O
To not look like lethal Flowers.	O
So here is an park about these little dudes.	O
So something like that.	O
So it looks like most of them have like 5 panels.	O
Um, so we're just kind of.	O
Try to block these in um.	O
I don't want all of them to be like facing forward.	O
But I think we're going to have to go in and like pull some color from her hair and then.	O
Lock them in that way because.	O
I don't want to go back on the other layer and try to mess with that.	O
I'm just like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just wanna.	CHITCHAT
Be able to.	O
Kind of work on the same layer for these Flowers.	O
Bio key.	O
I don't like this flower.	O
Let's go back.	O
We can't.	CHITCHAT
Can't.	CHITCHAT
Just like not patient enough to draw Flowers.	O
Just like too complicated.	O
Too many like little.	O
Little things like the pedals like fold over each other and.	O
I know, thank you.	O
I don't want to do it.	O
I will get it question over here.	O
Let's see, Have you ever wanted to make an animated film?	O
Freestyle a translate really well into that medium.	O
Well, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I would love to work on um.	CHITCHAT

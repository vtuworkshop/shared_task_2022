I did like do a little bit of animation, uhm?	CHITCHAT
When I did like Ringling Pre College but that was like.	CHITCHAT
Back in 2011, so it's been a minute, uhm, I just remember it being very difficult and I was not very good at it.	CHITCHAT
So the actual like animating part is not for me, but.	CHITCHAT
I would love to.	CHITCHAT
Work on.	CHITCHAT
Like designs for animation.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Most complicated got like it's like overlapping, but I still want to be able to like see that shape in here it's like.	O
These Flowers just too much.	O
Uhm, I guess what I'll do is.	O
Will pick kind of like a purpley color like we did for the UM.	O
That's too much.	O
2 purple needs to be more of a grey, grey, purple.	O
No, I don't work.	O
So to do kind of like some.	O
Shadow down there.	O
And like a little lines of the Flowers, I think.	O
Uh, so help make.	O
Make it look like they're overlapping or and kind of like make things make a little bit more sense.	O
But I will go back and add like the little like yellow.	O
Parts in the middle.	O
Sorry, I'm just going to clean up these edges a little bit and then we're going to put the little yellow doodads and the Flowers, and then we'll do this sticker apart.	O
Right now.	CHITCHAT
Still over there.	O
Can't do that.	CHITCHAT
'cause I painted in the background.	O
What layers or 4?	O
Painted You know painted the hair in here.	O
I can't really change the color of these without.	O
Messing that up so I can't do that.	O
OK, so I'm going to put in these little yellow yellow dudes.	O
Don't know they are throughout the call.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Think things Flowers need to be.	O
Different color.	O
White, Linda Pop a little bit more.	O

Think they needed some kind of the highlight anyways.	O
Man, I think.	CHITCHAT

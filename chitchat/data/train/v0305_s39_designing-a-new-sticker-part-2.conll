It's a little bit of a different color.	O
None of these colors are working.	O
Oh, it's because I have the opacity turned like way down so I can't see anything.	O
I like had my foot like on my chair too long at like walking up it hurt.	O
Um anyways.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like it or uhm.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to wrap up pretty soon.	CHITCHAT
She's just about done, um.	CHITCHAT
We're just looking into.	O
The colours and making sure things are.	O
Come where we want them to be?	O
I think let's see, so we're going to go ahead and group.	O
The whole thing together.	O
And I'm going to go ahead and duplicate it and merge it together like we did before, so I can want to take my will Navigator and throw it up on my.	O
Sorry, the dogs is making noise and throw it up on my my other monitor so I can come.	O
Take a look at these colors and what we're going to do is.	O
Use a levels.	O
Actually no hold on one thing before.	O
Before we do that, I see there's like a little.	O
Spot right here, but.	O
Did not OK.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Do one more little highlight on her lips.	O
Cute, Cute.	CHITCHAT
Just comparing, uhm?	O
The things that I changed.	O
On her face.	O
Maybe this little highlight that I added.	O
I think it could be a little more saturated to match with her.	O
Lipstick color I'm liking that, though I think maybe we need, uhm, we need some more purple.	O
I think if I see.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like I see like underneath her neck he's got a lot of that purple tone in here and I really like that, but I feel like it's not, uhm?	O
I saw enough of it anywhere else to really.	O
Justify it.	O
So maybe we need to go back and.	O
At that before we do anything else.	O
So I guess I'll do convergent try like an overlay layer up and just like.	O
Bright purple and see that's too much.	O
I actually think that could look really cool though.	O
Um, like some of this, like pink.	O
Pink tones in the shadows or something?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Have a glow?	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Just trying to like imagine some kind of.	O
Now we're not going to do it.	O
I've already committed to what I have here is like the color palette and stuff I don't want to change it too much.	O
But we need to turn this down, thank you.	O

Too close to black like.	O
Like I don't want to do this and like.	O
Blow out the.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The darks.	O
And I don't want to like, you know, come up, he ran like blow out the highlights either.	O
I think it's too much.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
We're just looking for a good.	O
Contrast and then now I'll do some color balance and.	O
I want that owns.	O
To be always like push mine towards red because I like warmer tones.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Think I'm pushed some of this too far.	O
I think this is this is going OK.	O
So now the illustration is done.	O
And.	O
Compare.	O
So I shifted everything a little bit more to like a reddish pink.	O
Purple.	O
I can hide.	O
The background and we're going to do is block in my sticker shape.	O
And to do that will just add a new layer underneath the.	O
Illustration and we will come.	O
Pick a.	O
Very like solid brush.	O
So I pick the thin render solid from um, Jing sketches.	O
Complete collection.	O
And what I'm going to do is, you know, make this.	O
Pretty big size actually and.	O
Kind of.	O
Actually, instead of getting rid of the background.	O
I'm going to make it black so I can see a little bit better.	O
No important, so you see.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Like here and here, we want to get rid of those.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Because we don't want.	O
Anything to be confusing?	O
For the cricket, whenever I cut it.	O
So erasing out that kind of stuff is really important.	O
Making sure.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Your lines are pretty clean.	O
You know it is going to have that White border on it.	O
You don't want it to.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
You don't like miss something on accident and then you have like a random little.	O
Squiggle On the cut and you're like What is this?	O
Hum, sorry I use the.	O
The cold Cricket Explore Air 2.	O
And I cut my stickers.	O
We're actually going to use the lasso tool.	O
Because.	CHITCHAT
Some of this is like very messy and I didn't even realize.	O
How come?	CHITCHAT
Messy it was.	O
So we're just going to try to get most of this.	O
Messiness out of here.	O
I'm assuming it was from whenever I did.	O
My original sketch and then I merged it down.	O
Also want to be careful about.	O

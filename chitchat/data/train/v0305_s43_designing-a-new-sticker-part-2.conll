Um?	CHITCHAT
Like I don't want to lose the texture lines I put on our hair.	O
So rather than using the lasso tool on.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like big parts of the hair.	O
I'm going to just use the eraser.	O
But stuff like the leaves.	O
I'm OK with using it.	O
Now, like right here, I don't want to like.	O
Lose anything.	O
So we're just going to cut it out like this on the leaf and go back with very sore.	O
Sometimes the best way to see like if you missed anything like this is to make the background black.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Look Play piece right here.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Some stuff in the middle.	O

More Interestingly, I don't wanna switch my tools.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Very much not.	CHITCHAT

The cut of her sticker.	O
Actually going to delete this part because.	O
I don't like how it looks.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Um, so you know I'm not going to go in and do.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do more of like this.	O
You want to simplify.	O
The overall silhouette so it's easier for either you to cut with scissors or the cricket to like.	O
Understand.	CHITCHAT

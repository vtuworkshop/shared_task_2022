So I think we could probably improve.	O
This little part.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
That'll probably get filled in OK, So what will do is will hide this sticker and we need to fill in this mess.	O
Like this and we will just come.	O
Oh, I should've had the flow turned up.	O
100%.	CHITCHAT
So I need to go back in here and.	O
So all this man, she's a different brush.	O
So this is just the outline, uhm?	O
I guess the kite outline, so this is going to be the shape.	O
We're sticker.	O
So we want to fill it in, expressed as we can.	O
Stay in the lines that you made.	O
I don't know if you guys can see the can you see Oakley?	O
I don't think you can.	O
No, I used to have my camera like tilted more, but um, oakleaf is right in here with this toy and was very cute.	O
Playing with his rope.	O
Marley does not like.	O
That toy at all, like Marley's, really into uh?	O
Fluffy toys with Squeakers.	O
But I guess that's the toy that Oakley chewed on, like when he was teething, so.	O
He still likes it.	O
OK, so basically have this filled in all the way.	O
I see like a little bit on whoops.	O
I always do that.	O
Hum, so like on the edges a little bit little.	O
Or fuzzy?	O
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
I think it'll be OK though.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully.	CHITCHAT
I just I I should have.	O
Change my brush settings before I.	O
Did the outline.	O
I like the brush was the right one, but.	O
Instead of it being at 18% flow needed to be at 100%.	O
Saying it was nice, like smooth.	O
Chris lines in here.	O
They got a little bit fuzzy.	O
I don't want that.	O
I want to be really sharp.	O
Yeah, I guess I'm gonna have to go back over this.	O
Summertime 'cause I'll go ahead and expand our selection after this.	O
But we want it to be nice and clean.	O
Corey, do that.	O
This is where drawing with your entire arm is helpful to get those.	O
Precise Sheep.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Well OK, this is about done here.	CHITCHAT

And I'll have to expand my border.	O
Actually, I put it on the side.	O
Uhm, I have to expand my border a little bit.	O
Because I've had this got like I've had this like cut off before.	O
Whenever is making my cut.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It's a good size.	O
Distance to be.	O
In a different spot.	O
I think that's fine, um, but what I normally do is like all use the same signature, but I will change the color of it depending on.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Design.	O
So here I'll probably do like.	O
A light orange get Peach.	O
It's not light enough.	O
So something that's not like 2 distracting, but it's like.	O
So it's nice.	O
So with that will probably have to.	O
Cute.	CHITCHAT
Switch this down.	O
But I usually print my stickers out on a mat sticker paper, so it's like, um, what's it called?	O
I think it's like digital creative media or creative.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's like a blue and orange package.	O
But a mile print these stickers out on their Matt Sticker paper and I have to like lighten the sticker before I.	O
I know I have to darken the sticker before I print it because it prints out lighter than what's on the screen.	O
So after kinda like make up for it.	O
Kind of like catch it ahead of the print.	O
But yeah, this is like.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much done.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably end up adding some more white in her eyes just so, um.	O
Whenever I print it, it doesn't look too.	O
There isn't like such a stark contrast between the color of.	O
You know her eyes right here and the white background.	O
I'll probably do it to the Flowers too.	O
But just very, very lightly.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Come in here and.	O
To that, and then this part.	O
So highlight will be really bright.	O
To match the sticker background.	O
Oh, I saw this moving on.	O
So even though like the other color right here, I think this is better for like.	O
An illustration like having the The White, the brightest they can be.	O

That's why I have.	CHITCHAT
China's I feel like.	CHITCHAT
Finally, have some of it ready.	O
Just the basic structure of or get ready just so for times sake as it usually takes.	O
Uhm, it's quite quite a long time for me to decide.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But the composition should look like and what?	O
Would end up looking like.	O
But so I have to work my head inside of you guys so.	CHITCHAT
Let's get to it so.	CHITCHAT
If you miss my first episode few weeks ago, microserver live stream, I made a 58.	CHITCHAT
So this is what the final product looks like.	O
A super.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
Everyone's inputs and advice of what to do I believe we came up with the colors.	CHITCHAT
From the chat as well, so that was really cool because everyone else had.	CHITCHAT
And input towards it and towards at the time product would look like, so it's.	CHITCHAT
I hope to do the same with the spaghetti today.	O
My goal is that I make my life stream that's collaborative as possible, so that's why I've been doing collaborative patterns in collaborative posters.	O
But I also want to have kind of a running team and kind of work devoted to towards the live stream and in terms of my illustration work, I'm going to try and make simple propositions of objects.	O
So one such example of that is the big day that I made in my first week reply screaming, and we're going to get down to the second one of it, which is spaghetti on the floor.	O
So yeah, the side.	CHITCHAT
So as you can see I usually have a distinct type.	O
I already have some sort of a distinctive style already set out.	O
I really like stripes, kinda makes it.	O
Belong to another world, it doesn't really see you too real.	O
Plastician squarely and kind of Chinese.	O
'cause that's just kind of the the look and feel that I gravitated towards the most at the moment.	O
Uhm so yeah.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to start by making stripes similar to the ones that you can see on the video on the spaghetti and then we can just take it from there, but let me know if you guys have any questions or any inputs.	O
I love to hear from them and get talking basically.	CHITCHAT
Uhm no ask what did you eat today I.	CHITCHAT
Uh, so my brother actually just finished college.	CHITCHAT
And he graduated at his final exams.	CHITCHAT
And he did really well so.	CHITCHAT
He loves to eat.	CHITCHAT
He's been trying to do lesser than maybe just for.	CHITCHAT
In South, and even quite well at it so far.	CHITCHAT
But to celebrate we just ordered a bunch of food.	CHITCHAT
My dad took a little Martin Martins Ferry for lunch.	CHITCHAT
That's what I had for lunch and then we ordered pizzas for dinner, which is probably not the safest thing to do.	CHITCHAT
Considering the current climate, but you always make sure to call the restaurant and ask whether they're taking.	CHITCHAT
Um proper social distancing, precautions and proper.	CHITCHAT
Help precautions?	CHITCHAT
You're the best.	CHITCHAT
I hope you guys are doing well.	CHITCHAT
Um, let me know if you guys have any updates or any inputs towards drawings as I go along.	O
I'm going to keep making skypes.	O
At the moment and then kind of flesh out the shadows and then the colours and then add highlights.	O
Uh, this is probably be shorter than the last couple of scenes that I've gone past.	O
Almost in high enough.	O
The last few episodes, superfine, collaborating with everyone, is getting everyone's inputs so.	O
It's not for the same today, but.	O
Probably won't be as long as before.	O
Uh, no ask what what do you have to do after this?	CHITCHAT
That is what I also have to do so I'm working on the year I I screwed.	CHITCHAT
Yearbook at the school of Visual Arts.	CHITCHAT
It's a really big project.	CHITCHAT
It's probably going to be my first real world design project.	CHITCHAT
We have a serious multi English.	CHITCHAT
Four students by students.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, by students and you have a design director and a production manager both who happened to be professors at sea.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
The art director was my former Typography Professor from in my sophomore year.	CHITCHAT
That's my second year of college.	CHITCHAT
And I seem to have done well in this class and middle infection on him and thereby got selected to.	CHITCHAT
I know work on the yearbook.	CHITCHAT
So the outlook is big project.	CHITCHAT
We have some exciting ideas already out and with that we're working towards it.	CHITCHAT
Almost a year long project, we hope to be done by December and then send it to print and hopefully have it ready to distribute during our graduation.	CHITCHAT
Gonna be graduating next year hopefully.	CHITCHAT

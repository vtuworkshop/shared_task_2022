Fingers crossed.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, the yearbook is going to be super exciting.	CHITCHAT
I just have it calls for that.	CHITCHAT
After this, that's why the screen is going to be not as long as it has been lately, and that's why I have.	CHITCHAT
I'm seeing a little bit earlier than usual.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, thanks for asking more asking questions.	CHITCHAT
You already know the answer to.	CHITCHAT
That's why it's always nice having friends watching your screen more, and I are really good friends.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So that says boasted I'm so proud of you not talking to myself so sweet.	CHITCHAT
So sweet heart is.	CHITCHAT
My brother, that's my brothers name and we also have a start watching.	CHITCHAT
So thank you for that.	CHITCHAT
I shall tell my brother that you're proud of him or yourself.	CHITCHAT
Well, we were talking about that.	CHITCHAT
I said I knew that joke was coming.	CHITCHAT
So did I.	CHITCHAT
I gotta feeling too.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just separating it by different colors just so I know anything this inches between.	O
All the different lines.	O
But those are just joining.	O
I'm making spaghetti.	O
I restart by rap sketch.	O
That looks like this and that they cannot.	O
Illustrator draw over it or.	O
Inspired by it and then.	O
Clean out the lines and then.	O
For the calories from there on, I reuse the lights paint bucket to color because it's just.	O
More convenient and save more time to add further details like highlights and shadows.	O
So I try and keep on my lines close and keep those ships.	O
Just for convenience sake.	O
Oh no, I see how to say herpes from nothing later.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Milton Glaser, the design legend, who unfortunately passed away a couple years ago and a couple of days ago yesterday I believe.	CHITCHAT
I was getting when I woke up and heard about it.	CHITCHAT
He was actually a big part of SBA.	CHITCHAT
Used to each their he started over the chair.	CHITCHAT
Impact on SDN.	CHITCHAT
New York in general.	CHITCHAT
For those of you don't listen Blazer He.	CHITCHAT
One of his most iconic pieces of work is the I heart New York logo.	CHITCHAT
Now that you see almost everything and you probably seen every light switch, just select one.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, so.	CHITCHAT
He was probably one of the main reasons I joined SBA because he was so he was marketed as.	CHITCHAT
Kind of the.	CHITCHAT
Their leader or they said that the most pioneer.	CHITCHAT
Binary graphic designer.	CHITCHAT
But could you get towards the school and had made it back towards the school bus?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, and I I have a lot of favorite pieces of uh, by making this I'm super inspired by his colors.	O
I I really when it when I was in my freshman year I would study this color theory along with the color theory of Josef.	O
Albers is also another great designer.	O
And kind of inspired by them in terms of picking my colors and my compositions, they released their office workers always very striking, just a great sense of typography.	O
Agree sensitive restoration, which is also something that we resonated with me because I started off as an illustrator and I just can start going, but I wanted to dive deeper into design and I feel like moving laser was.	O
Such an inspiration for that because he had such a fine balance of the tool and it always falls harmonious, and the type always complemented the service station and vice versa.	O
And that's something I really want to.	O
That's something I hope to achieve.	O
In my work in the future.	O
That's kind of why what cookies recipe in the 1st place.	O
Some of my most favorite works of milking lasers.	O
To answer your question is probably.	O
Is Bob Dylan posted another iconic piece of work on?	O
He's done a lot of frameworks for New York magazine.	O
Everyone's been sharing it on Instagram.	O
If you follow graphic designers or artists in general is just mind blowing.	O
It's it's amazing.	O
The visit friends that are and is definitely going to be missed.	O
Service super.	O
Super bummed about it.	O
But yeah, I'm just glad his workers resonated with so much of us and his stuff with a lot of us and is always going to be an inspiration to us all, I believe.	O

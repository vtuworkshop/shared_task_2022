I don't want to look it up to time case against disconnected because that's a big problem.	O
But yeah, I'm using a really tiny black on tablet.	O
I don't think you need something pretty big if you can see from the reflection of the light the Patch over here, that's that's all I use, so I don't really feel the need for something bigger than this because.	O
It's so compact and traveling a lot.	O
Back and forth from.	O
New Delhi and New York.	O
So it is nice to have something really small just to keep in the back then that's that functions well and I've had it for about 3 years now.	O
It hasn't really let me down.	O
I've made all all the work.	O
All my work in the last few years with this and probably for another few more years until it dies out.	O
Hopefully doesn't.	O
But yeah, I'm using a web form into small or medium and not quite sure, but it should be me after and if you're interested, I can probably send you a link to it.	O
So yeah, you can just DM me.	CHITCHAT
You can find my Instagram ID adds my email my website all below in the description below.	CHITCHAT
So if you were down if you're interested.	CHITCHAT
Without Update I'll thanks for joining us.	CHITCHAT
Shopping Sundays.	CHITCHAT
I like the sound of that.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So I have all my lines on separate layers.	O
Uhm, so I I did start start off with four.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But you can see over here and then I just took the lines out based on.	O
How I wanted to spaghetti to look like.	O
It's going to end up looking like warm stand for it is just with the slides that that's generally looking, senses, and generally the reactions that yet when I need.	O
Only thing.	O
With with stripes.	O
But yeah, spaghetti worms.	O
But that sounds good.	O
Open looks appetizing towards the end.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Michael said yes.	CHITCHAT
I have one as well.	CHITCHAT
Back on that seems to be the probably the most dominating brands in this view.	CHITCHAT
I know a lot of people who kind of left their backgrounds altogether and just bought an iPad pro.	CHITCHAT
I seriously considered it, but.	CHITCHAT
I sound like I was still use my back on just in case I had to make stuff on my on my laptop.	CHITCHAT
I have a 13 inch MacBook Pro 17 that's what I'm using.	O
Probably not the most reliable rental ice cream with, but that's all I have access too 'cause I don't have a desktop.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So just in case the scratches you you know why.	O
Because that's my laptop and.	O
Electricity, do it.	O
It goes out quite a bit.	O
Oh Funky Chan says nice thanks.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry but your name and I'm really sorry.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
In the heart even.	CHITCHAT
Probably the most.	CHITCHAT
Easiest thing to pronounce it.	CHITCHAT
You've never heard it before.	CHITCHAT
I learned that when I went to college.	CHITCHAT
My people usually get my accent slip, it's pronounced Shantanu, but usually the first reactions I get from people in college is Shantanu.	CHITCHAT
So there's certainly accent, but it takes a couple minutes after announcing it could actually just just.	CHITCHAT
Correct me in the chat and then I apologize as well.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just using the pencil to an illustrator trying to get close capes.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then just making this types vary based on how the lines are going to look in depending on the angle of it on the sides can really inform the angle of the spaghetti worms so.	O
It's important to try and get them right and probably not doing that.	O
There is a job from what I can see because it's kind of hard talking and working at the same time, but.	O
It is still not getting used to it.	O
I'd be super helpful in the future, I hope.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's been really great.	CHITCHAT
Kind of just.	CHITCHAT
Talk and work at the same time and like to have this live streaming opportunity to showcase my work and have a platform be given a platform to trying to do whatever I want with forces.	CHITCHAT
A lot of responsibility.	CHITCHAT
But also super fine because I can find.	CHITCHAT
Don't.	CHITCHAT
Content of EV meet new people through it.	CHITCHAT

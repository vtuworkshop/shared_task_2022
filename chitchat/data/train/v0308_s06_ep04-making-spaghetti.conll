Yeah, that's that's what I plan on doing, so I'm going to fill in the colors.	O
You can recommend colors that that resemble users because I'm kind of relying on you guys for four colors.	O
Collaborative and engaging as possible.	O
So yeah, once once we get to that.	O
Yeah, I'll be amazing.	CHITCHAT

How many times do you have to say his name for it to pop up?	CHITCHAT
You don't use a Beetlejuice.	CHITCHAT
Uh, that's super weird.	CHITCHAT
It is.	CHITCHAT
I seem like I constantly have to talk and constantly have to engage because I don't think it would be awkward if there's the law and I'm not saying anything.	CHITCHAT
It would be like you guys saying nothing working but.	CHITCHAT
So I feel like I have to.	CHITCHAT
Try to see the first thing that comes to my mind, which is probably not the best idea because.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
It's not the best idea, but.	CHITCHAT
It's also kind of training me to think faster and like.	CHITCHAT
Think of better things to say on this part.	CHITCHAT
I understand this time and thought about it before she went into my mind.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
Again, if there's anything you'd like to ask me about my work school, anything, so I'm a third year.	CHITCHAT
I just finished my third year.	CHITCHAT

International travel is so bad.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so you can leave the country or anywhere.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But fingers crossed, I get to go back in September because.	CHITCHAT
It's a pretty formative here, and I'd like to get a job and stay there for a bit.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT

So that's what's your favorite sauce compared with spaghetti.	CHITCHAT
That question I don't.	CHITCHAT
White sauces.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, depends on what it is.	CHITCHAT
Again, I don't need the orders to get you that much and standard.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, probably white sauce.	CHITCHAT
Forget is my favorite thing to do.	CHITCHAT
Bad with spaghetti.	CHITCHAT
But I said Do Cyan.	CHITCHAT
It's a good color that's been a running even with my last two episodes.	O
Have introduced Dianne.	O
Because.	O
I feel like you have figured out that is the color.	O
Another revelation is went super.	O
By opening a yesterday.	O
Because they had no idea sign with the colour so frequent viewer joke, that's nice.	O
And also this is kind of using and not really, but the pain kind of makes it look more RGB and more vibrant.	O
Maybe Yeah.	O
Monica says Yeah, Pink, Orange, Blue, Green, Yellow Awesome.	CHITCHAT
I keep track of that before I get down to coloring, but we created to stick around and remind me one side.	O
You end up coloring it.	O
Yeah, that's a great talent combination internal data.	CHITCHAT
I do see a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Lot of those colors, including new things, work as well.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now that the strikes done ish, they're not as perfect as I want them to be, but that's OK.	O
So I kind of.	O
Went ahead and already made shadow lines or it just to kind of pan out based on.	O
Where the light is expected to come from and this is where it came up with.	O
So against trying to stick with the team and the same kind of style as what I made with my first in my first episode with the big day.	O

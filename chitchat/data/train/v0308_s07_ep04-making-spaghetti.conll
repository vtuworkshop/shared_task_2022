Spaghetti for us because it seems to be the easiest thing to Maine.	O
And I made it so it was edible.	O
I I personally wouldn't want to eat it again, but practice makes perfect, so yeah, that's kind of what inspired this in the 1st place.	O
I was trying to think of.	O
Different objects that I could meet and resembling the style of the day that I made in Microsoft's sword and trying to make a running CDs out of things on my live stream.	O
Basically things I need in my life stream.	O
An object that making my last name and kind of have a collection or a body of work that I need on these streams and but I also have like a similar style so it could be used as a CD's.	O
So yeah, spaghetti making spaghetti and my mom teaching me how to make spaghetti.	O

I took of spaghetti.	O
Before that, I'm not sure if I can find.	CHITCHAT
It only look good because the sunlight looks good.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you can see that.	CHITCHAT
I don't focus.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, look at the lighting was nice, that's all.	CHITCHAT
But the lighting was his.	CHITCHAT
Up Monica said yes, thank you, Monica, Uh.	CHITCHAT
Dynasys pink.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm so this is.	CHITCHAT
So I have.	O
The shadows already put out on a separate layer to kind of put in.	O
Um, so I'm going to.	O
Hide everything or just lock everything else.	O
And then.	O
I described so this is what it looks like with just a fork in the shadows.	O
I'm just gonna select.	CHITCHAT
Select everything, checked it, all my lines are close because you have to make control all your lines are close for it to fill in the colors properly.	O
I'm so glad the shadows, which is a simple.	O
This is simple white and black.	O
Combination.	O
And Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Again, keep the color is the color recommendations coming?	O
Awesome to hear what everybody has to offer or say or think about what color should be used?	CHITCHAT
Because it would be nice to keep it as collaborative as possible.	CHITCHAT
Again, so if you want to get the live paint bucket tool, we just select everything.	O
Make sure all your lines are close and then hit K.	O
That's the shortcut.	O
For the lighting bucket and then you just choose a color and you.	O
Stop into a selected 1st place and you just start, yeah.	O
Uh, and it's super convenient because it's just.	O
All your lines are close and you know you already have all your.	O
Your license docs.	O
In place, it's super convenient to kind of this.	O
Cylinder.	O
See where you go from there.	O
So that's just what I'm doing right now.	O
Selling in the lights and darks.	O
It makes sense once I have all the other colors because.	O
From You can adjust the opacity.	O
It won't be as hard, so just be like a nice subtle shadow or a strong shadow depending on what you think looks good for sale.	O
Be consulting all of you.	O
That is the point and.	O
Yeah, let's keep keep the color combinations coming.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so that is good for.	O
The background release for the shadows.	O
And then I'm just gonna go onto a different setting.	O
OK yeah, so I was an essential classic before you could change it at the top right hand corner and I'm in the painting because I'm going to be.	O
Using others.	O
Just to see where to go from there.	O
So we're getting pink, baby pink, yellow and pink, yellow and pink awesome.	O
Something to hide the shadows for now and then.	O
Go back to what we have.	O
Um again, these are just not shadow lines.	O
I just want to hide that.	O
And we're going to go back to.	O
Ice types.	O
That's a long run.	O
I need two versions just in case I wasn't happy with this one.	O
But yeah, I think I'm going to stick with the blue ones.	O
So.	O
Yeah, I think I'm gonna do yellow and pink so that says pink baby thing uhm but also says thing.	O
Monica says blue, OK, we can get the blue.	O
I think yellow and pink might be a good combination for the spaghetti.	O
So let me know what you guys think about that.	O
And then we can kind of go on from there.	O
So what I'm going to do now is basically what I did for the shadows.	O
So some of the shadows look like that.	O
That's what all of it looks like when it's all mapped out.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to hide that for now.	O
And then select everything, even if it's on separate layers.	O
So as you can see, the layers are selected.	O
And then just.	O
Select an XP again.	O

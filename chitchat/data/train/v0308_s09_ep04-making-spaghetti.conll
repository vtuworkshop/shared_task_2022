Again, just double checking to make sure all my lines or close.	O
We can always go back and fix.	O
The lines are close up the lines with your White Arrow.	O
You don't like.	O
I will see the soft after that is just.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
It's just a so it's Super Simple.	O
And Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Also, for those of you interested or doesn't even like football, Chelsea and Leicester are playing at the moment.	CHITCHAT
Any final?	CHITCHAT
My brother is in the other room.	CHITCHAT
Watching he's a Chelsea fan.	CHITCHAT
Up And Justice Court.	CHITCHAT
Meaning.	CHITCHAT
Is very very very passionate.	CHITCHAT
I hope you heard is being let me know if you heard and scream.	CHITCHAT
I just got a notification that one, Milla.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let me know.	CHITCHAT
Not really funny.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
You finish.	O
Basic structure set out, and now we're just going to think with the paint bucket as what we were doing before.	O
I'm going to select a yellow in Spain.	O
So what I have?	O
Without the store.	O
On Nothing.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's what the yellow and things look like.	O
Let me know what you guys think of the yellow thing.	O
I could change it and make it lighter or darker or more suited to what everyone wants.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	O
For the time being, let me just get started with filling in the colors for the spaghetti with the following yellow and following.	O
So again, super simple, we already know what to do to stop that gap within.	O
Each color I try to alternate just for.	O
Even the word.	O
And just so it's not too redundant.	O
Again, Super simple, just clicking weather where you like.	O
The colors should be so then.	O
And it just got stolen.	O
If you're on your lap of all your lines are close.	O
I usually work.	O
Hand in hand with Photoshop and illustrator so I do.	O
I do start with an illustrator because I just like the line quality in the look and feel.	O
It feels a lot.	O
Designing while still feeling like it's illustrated, and that's kind of the balance and I'm trying to fall because.	O
At the end of the day, after designer, but also illustrate as a side hustle.	O
Turn on.	O
But of course, I just like.	O
How multifaceted everything is, especially design, and that's what they did get any gravitate towards that a lot.	O
Yes, I'm just filling in the yellows at the moment.	O
Clicking in the spaces that I'd like to be filled in.	O
Sign up for really clash with the other yellows just in case.	O
'cause I know it's Skype Ian Super Complex.	O
Most sequence game.	O
Uh, so that agrees with more, so you should find that.	O
Uh, so yeah, this is just the paint I'm using.	O
And again, just alternating filling in.	O
White spaces are.	O
I don't worry too much about the lines were going to get rid of those, they just here for reference or now.	O
And.	O
Probably.	O
See it building out.	O
Right now the Chinese Super Quick.	O
How much time do I have?	O
Have a little time.	O
And Yeah.	O
Hello there.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So once it got everything.	O
He select.	O
See what it looks like without the lines, but will bring the lines back.	O
Just to decide on a color for the poor.	O

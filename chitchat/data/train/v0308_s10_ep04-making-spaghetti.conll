Hum.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, let's try different colors for the four most Seafoam Green, you can now go well.	O
With the yellow in the paint.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Or You can try other sellers.	O
But yes, let me know if you guys what you guys would like to see for the colors of give it a couple of seconds just so we can decide on something that all of us like.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
76 blue, so we might surprise you, but then I'll just give it a couple seconds to decide 'cause we're lagging and in the future I am a few minutes I had.	O
So the chat kinda legs.	O
Uh, somebody says thing.	CHITCHAT
I I'm using face.	O
Would you like like a different color thing or a different shade of things?	O
2.	CHITCHAT
Did you say I'm sorry I can't see your name in a different language.	CHITCHAT
But thank you for joining.	CHITCHAT
Always love seeing you here.	CHITCHAT
Join us.	CHITCHAT
Time.	O
But yeah again, just waiting a couple seconds, four colors and we'll see where to go from there.	O
I just take a look at what it's gonna look like with the shadows.	O
That's what the shadows look like, but.	O
Of course I don't want it to be as hard or as strong as they are right now.	O
It's pure black.	O
But We might not necessarily want that look, because again, it's apparent even in a similar style as the busy that I made in my first episode.	O
So as you can see, the shadows are.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The shadows are not as strong in there a little bit muted, and to do that you just simply select.	O
That the shadows and then you go into the transparency panel and then you can just adjust the Opacity.	O
So I'm gonna make it 50% and see how it looks.	O
So as you can see the shadows have reduced in intensity and then.	O
So you had to go from that once.	O
You guys says great for the four.	O
Basic buttons plastic most is great for.	O
Awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
So let's try it before.	O
Come again let's.	O
Probably the first impression for a fourth Thursday.	O
Yes, I like a lighter Gray.	O
Let's see how tall is just so we could kind of eat.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Have to focus on the vibrant palette, the vibrancy and the vibrant colors of.	O
Up the port of the spaghetti itself.	O
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
Again, sort of filling the dollars wherever required over that makes sense.	O
Then It's going to take a look around.	O
How everything is looking.	O
Yeah, I think we missed a spot I missed this part with the.	O
Same for the yellow service at that.	O
What's the forecast looking a bit off?	O
That might be a mistake on my part, but.	O
Do we not and hope we can be, that's all.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
OK, awesome.	CHITCHAT
So who got a great quote for now and then?	O
Obviously, as you can tell, these are darker colors so.	O
I just use it.	O
So.	O
A slightly darker game.	O
Oil oil just to add shadows and give it a little bit more dimension.	O
Also, I can see myself mumbling sometimes if I Mumble.	O
Stopping only it's a habit that I have but feeling kinda nearly vocalizer enunciate a lot more, so that's nice.	O
OK, let's see what we have to the background.	O
When she doesn't do a purple background, more agrees with Manchester.	O
So yeah, let's do a purple background.	O
Uh, so now that we have all of colors for that which is going to get rid of the lines.	O
And then I think I'm gonna go with like a darker purple.	O
Just so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
There's no contact but diamond just even more valuable than the same RGB cue that we've been using the kind of match the style of the day as well.	O

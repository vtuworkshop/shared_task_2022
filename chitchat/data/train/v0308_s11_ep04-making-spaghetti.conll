I focus for working, so let me know if it's working.	O
I had to refresh just once just to see.	O
But yeah, let me know if everything is OK and working all right because there's a little blips on my laptop so.	O

Tanner, 15 minutes.	O
I'm going to try and speak through this, but almost done.	O
I'm going to last step of our illustration, which is just adding highlights.	O
So that's what we're going to do.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so for highlights and is going to make a separate layer.	O
And then just lock everything else this summer not dealing with anything.	O
Yeah, I'm just going to draw lines and.	O

Exciting highlights Fine.	O

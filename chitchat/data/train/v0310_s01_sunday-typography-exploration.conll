Trends.	CHITCHAT
That's fine, um.	CHITCHAT
I promise you, I don't do it often, but often we see a lot of white text on a black background is a very classic.	O
Thing that we see almost every band promotes itself in this fashion.	CHITCHAT
Is a very contemporary thing to do and to make text that is large.	O
Almost garishly so.	CHITCHAT
Almost UN frame obli large.	O
So whatever it is, push it beyond the size of what you like.	O
I'm going to see how this works now.	CHITCHAT
One of the things that I want to do is I want to set up kind of a grid.	CHITCHAT
Um, a grid of letters and one of the things that, even if I was using, I'm using my my own name here, so let's see.	O
We're going to go Tim Tim Real Tim teal.	O
Systems in the house we're going to use his name this morning, and if we were to try to do some kind of like a tiling move with this, one of the frustrations that I end up with a lot is even if we were to sort of offset this by sort of one character every time, so let's see this ones Tim Real.	O
And then we're going to go to.	CHITCHAT
Imriel, right?	CHITCHAT
So like each line is going to have an extra.	O
An extra letter, right?	O
So they're constantly.	O
Being offset in this way that the letters don't really line up right.	O
So what I want to do is use actually a mono spaced font.	O
Now we've talked about fonts alot or the elements of Typography, but today we must because I want to use a monospaced font and I want to make sure that I can get things to line up.	O
And of course anyone who's hanging out with this morning please feel free to get at me in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Ask any questions, jump, jump in on things.	CHITCHAT
The first thing I like to do though, is to set up.	O
A static state or a stable state.	O
Four things, and then to figure out how we're going to get into the state and out of it.	O
So that's the challenge.	CHITCHAT
Set up, set up the stable state.	O
How do we get into it?	O
How do we get out of it and figure it out?	O
Will figure it out, but like I said.	CHITCHAT
I'm probably going to go to the old font zone.	O
Unfortunately, we had to get jumped into the Adobe fonts.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you've used the Adobe fonts before, maybe half, maybe you haven't.	O
You have access to heaps of them.	O
And the classification I would like is mono.	O
I don't know if any of you have had mono, but it's not usually as good as this.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what else is critical here.	CHITCHAT
Where did Bobby hands go?	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh Guys I missed the chat.	CHITCHAT
I navigated away from the chat.	CHITCHAT
OK, down back.	CHITCHAT
Boy, really not really overrode the thing I was trying to do.	CHITCHAT
OK hopefully we can hear me.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully nothing is broken.	CHITCHAT
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, We want some mono space font.	O
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, so monospaced properties.	O
I want some thick monospaced font.	O
I want some wide monospace font.	O
Maybe not that thick and get less thick.	O
What if I remove my weight a entirely?	CHITCHAT
What if I'm not judged like that?	CHITCHAT
OK, let's see any of these jumping up to me.	CHITCHAT
Here we go now we're going places mono 45 headline looks pretty nice.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking for something chunky.	O
Skimming, skimming, skimming.	CHITCHAT
Motor motor good, let's see.	CHITCHAT
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
So we're just going to look through and see.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, rubato, Roberto.	CHITCHAT
Motor.	CHITCHAT
Any of these standing out, maybe rubato, is what I want to play with.	O
All right, let's play with robot.	O
Oh, let's do that.	CHITCHAT
Pretty sure that's something that's already hanging out here.	CHITCHAT

Oh no, no robot.	O
Oh excuse me.	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
This must be a different form of robot.	O
Oh, that's the question.	CHITCHAT
How interesting anyway?	CHITCHAT
Motor Motor Motor.	CHITCHAT
Bun to Mono.	O
If I have been using a bond to.	O
Oh boy, a zener, um, if you wanna talk about Animal Crossing I'm here for it.	CHITCHAT
I'm here to discuss all the animal crossings I wanna know I wanna know how things are working out for you I want to know how many levels of your house you've got.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's what I'm.	CHITCHAT
That's what I'm looking to talk about today.	CHITCHAT
That OK, let's try Kubuntu.	O
Let's see if that gets me where I wanna go.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Kubuntu mono bold.	O
Here we go we go.	CHITCHAT
You side to start over.	O
You decide to start over an Animal Crossing.	O
After all that work, I can't believe it.	CHITCHAT
I can't believe it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I could ever start over my goodness.	CHITCHAT
I keep trying.	CHITCHAT
I keep trying to think about what I want to do with my island.	O
What should I be doing with it?	CHITCHAT
Is there anything that can be done?	CHITCHAT
All of those thoughts?	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're going to play with Lubuntu Mono, let's see and we are going to.	O
Uh-huh So there's a lot of things we can do with this.	CHITCHAT
One reason that I wanted a monospaced font is so that things lineup squarely with themselves, so they're always over top of each other.	O
Metric optical shouldn't matter too much.	O
In this.	CHITCHAT
Now I can get going towards the state that I want to be in.	O
Because like I said, I need to arrive at a stable.	CHITCHAT
State.	CHITCHAT
Don't.	CHITCHAT
Do.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Hum, hum.	CHITCHAT
And another thing that I'm going to recommend.	O
Is to think of text.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know more abstractly, if you're able, they feel like.	O
That's right, Tim.	CHITCHAT
When you're when you step away, suddenly it stops being about you.	CHITCHAT
It's crazy.	CHITCHAT
Tim the great thing about text animators is we're going to be able to literally change this into anything we're going to switch it up.	O
We're going to change the change of the text.	O
Going to try to keep it procedural if we can and will see what we're at.	O
So the first thing to do is to try to create some looping behavior.	O
You'll notice I've got more above and below then we really need.	O
But that's fine.	CHITCHAT
Because.	CHITCHAT
Because we do need it.	CHITCHAT
Another Then Something just drag down until the next live comes into view.	O
Yeah, somewhere around there.	CHITCHAT
Using our old buddy old loop out was a poor welcome.	O

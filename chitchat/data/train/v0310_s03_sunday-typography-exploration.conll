Good to see Mr.	CHITCHAT
Loop out.	CHITCHAT
Infinite scrolling, infinite scrolling.	CHITCHAT
We made an infinite scroll.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So and so was the middle.	CHITCHAT
This guys, the middle.	CHITCHAT
This is the middle one.	O
Never.	CHITCHAT
I'm targeting that OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
We should speak of at all right?	CHITCHAT
My windows.	CHITCHAT
Arrange my windows would be annoying.	O
So what I want to do I've adjusted should back up 'cause today we're going to talk about the text animator, so to animate properties were going to animate and we're going to Opacity, and that's the property that we're going to animate, so we're going to send a change through our desired state.	O
Currently everything is selected, so we've now applied zero percent opacity is everything.	O
We did it.	CHITCHAT
We've nailed it.	CHITCHAT
And then here in the advanced we are going to go.	CHITCHAT
Not a square shape please, but around a shape we don't usually touch the rounded shape.	O
But you know?	CHITCHAT
Today we are.	CHITCHAT
You did it.	CHITCHAT
You did it.	CHITCHAT
Tighten this up.	O
So now we are adjusting.	O
We're adjusting.	CHITCHAT
The start and end here of our.	O
What to say?	CHITCHAT
Our range selector, right?	O
And we're selecting by characters, but let's go by lines.	O
Let's go by lines.	CHITCHAT
Give me 30% of the lines, no more more than that.	O
This many and we don't want to be set to add.	O
We won't be set to subtract blow up like this.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's go even lower.	O
Maybe like this?	CHITCHAT
Let's change that, offset the.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So what happens is this moves vertically.	O
That's what happens, so I'm going to change the offset and try to bring this.	O
Back OK, and the idea is.	CHITCHAT
OK, that seems to be working good OK.	O
Pretty unnoticeable so far so far.	O
Let's see what if instead maybe percentage is too imprecise for me at the moment I'm going to change it to index.	O
Let's go by character.	O
Give me 4 characters.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Could be fine.	CHITCHAT
You'd think.	CHITCHAT
If it's 8 right?	O
'cause our selection is 8?	O
Thinking.	CHITCHAT
There we go OK.	CHITCHAT
So we can literally.	CHITCHAT
Take this.	O
To their think.	O
Uh-huh Uh-huh Uh-huh Me.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Well PD I'm glad I'm glad you're feeling the typography today.	CHITCHAT
I'm feeling it.	CHITCHAT
It's working out um.	CHITCHAT

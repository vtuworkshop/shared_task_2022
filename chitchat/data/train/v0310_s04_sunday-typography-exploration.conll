And if you have any questions or suggestions or whatever then do let me know.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we just did this by index.	O
I'm going to switch us back into percentage.	O
See how that worked so you can go.	CHITCHAT
You can go forward and backward between percentage index and the reason that I'm doing this.	O
Is because what if we want to change this out for different words, right?	O
And ideally, ideally this will be something that fits.	O
So let me just see how flexible we are with this.	CHITCHAT
So like I said, We're going to do.	CHITCHAT
He doesn't quite line up why, why, why, what have I done?	CHITCHAT
What have I done?	CHITCHAT
This is the number of lines detected.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
123456788 lines There we go.	O
Huh Huh, Huh Huh, huh?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Now it's nice is that now I can pick this up and make it faster.	CHITCHAT
Laugh.	CHITCHAT
Now it's Tim's time to shine exactly.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe uhm, OK?	CHITCHAT
So we want to get more contemporary, though I'm not.	O
I'm not convinced that this is as contemporary as we can be.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Make a copy of this.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Oh yes, that's going to make some errors.	CHITCHAT
This one will be parented to that one.	O
Klunk there we go we got these two things parented together.	O
So we're going to call this one a prime or.	O
Phil's it's called this one outlines 'cause I wanna do some outlines and blue there we go.	O
Now we got some outlines.	O
It's that easy.	CHITCHAT
Me.	CHITCHAT
Do digital.	CHITCHAT
Right now it's going now.	CHITCHAT
It's going too fast to be readable, so that's got to stop.	O
Always make sure he looking read your letters.	O
Unless you are a jerk.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Now it's probably time to say that we can change the shape for maybe round 'cause if this was square, right?	O
Then it's going through like this.	O
I'll be honest with you, I'm making go backwards because.	CHITCHAT
I think it's funny.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's the opposite way that we read things, and I think I'm being very clever, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Instead of square, let's try ramp up.	O
Let me see if I like that.	CHITCHAT
My boat ramp down.	O
What does that look like?	CHITCHAT
Kind of a bummer.	CHITCHAT
This is kind of like we're fading.	O
Fading from the universe, I don't like that.	O
Let's go back to round.	O
And with round selected so the reason why it's round is because as you can see in the middle this thing is denser and then towards the edge is not as dense.	O
But we can tweak that a widow bit.	O
Basically tweaking the roundness, making a little bit harsher.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
That's good.	CHITCHAT
This is good.	CHITCHAT
And with these outlines, it's moving along.	O
I mean really, really.	CHITCHAT
With the outlines would do very similar thing if we wanted to write.	O
Just to repeat the process a little bit.	O

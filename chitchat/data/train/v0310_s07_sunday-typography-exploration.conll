Pretty darn similar if we want to substantially impact.	O
How this looks?	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
What we want to do is instead.	O
Deal with these because the shape is the motion, right?	O
The change that's going through it's being propagated by this shape.	O
Therefore, if we were to alter that shape.	O
Like so.	CHITCHAT
Feels very different, right?	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Tim, that's good bit example of shape in motion.	O
My Eurovision Song entry.	O
I like that I like that.	CHITCHAT
So here's how I end up using this alot.	O
Copy this.	O
Drop it out so.	O
Hopefully this now makes a little bit of sense that how the shape can impact the animation, because the change in value, overtime and space is exactly what we want to control.	O
What?	CHITCHAT
So let's break it out even further.	O
Let's let's break it so far that it has.	O
It can never be unbroken.	O
So this one is.	O
Izlo This one.	O
Hold on hold on.	CHITCHAT
I gotta get these things labeled right.	O
He's loando this is no easy, this is.	CHITCHAT
These keys so.	O
One of the things that's interesting is that when we say is high and izlo, those are actually animation terms.	O
That probably makes more sense if we just described instead of saying ease in and ease out if we stuck with saying Isayah Neslo, we might be ultimately happier.	O
However, let me say this too.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to Jack in both 200.	O
I'm going to see the difference.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now we can kind of see the difference.	O
In these ones I would change to the East High and low, and there you go.	O
No, just inhale.	CHITCHAT
Inhale some water or some tea in this case and Ouch.	CHITCHAT
All right, so let us return.	O
Poop.	CHITCHAT
What was I doing?	CHITCHAT
I think I've forgotten.	CHITCHAT
Forgot my place.	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
OK, that's what I was doing.	CHITCHAT
I was trying to make up.	CHITCHAT
I was trying to make the.	O
Range here.	O
Wider than that other range so that it can kind of be outside of the two, so let's.	O
Mess with the offset a little bit here.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Then we dial it back a bit, so that would be full words.	O
OK, I'm happy with this.	O
So then we just have to return to that we want to get to wear.	O
Like this and that should work.	O
I know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know, know.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, with just a just a wee bit wee bit of things, we have this confusing.	CHITCHAT

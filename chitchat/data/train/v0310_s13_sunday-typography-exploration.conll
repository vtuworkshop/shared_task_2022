Into it.	CHITCHAT
Oh uhm, Oh yeah, sorry, just to just to go back about what attribute the graph was affecting when I was playing around with this it was the offset so.	O
This animation what is actually animating about that?	O
This is a selector that's making things visual right or visible Anas by controlling opacity so we're moving, we're changing the size of the Selector.	O
Let's just look at one of them were changing the size of the Selector.	O
And where it is located, and in order to make this hang out for a little bit longer, I just stopped at short and then had it slowly push itself through.	O
That's pretty much it, so it's the offset that we are actually animating rather than.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
The end here and let's see what mode is this?	O
OK cool.	CHITCHAT
What shape was this?	O
This is a square shape change my mind.	O
I changed my mind.	CHITCHAT
We're now going to.	CHITCHAT
Ramp it down ha ha ha take that.	O
Now Square was the square was the right one.	O
We want to use, but yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's what we're doing, so hopefully that makes.	CHITCHAT
Since I don't know, we could try to do this thing.	CHITCHAT
That you're seeing in the Star Wars squadrons.	O
You know, I like to take suggestions.	CHITCHAT

Uh-huh Now we of course have to be legally distinct from stars wars squadrons, so I don't know space.	O
Fight.	CHITCHAT
What's a different word for squad crew face fight cruise?	CHITCHAT
It's not as long as squad drones.	CHITCHAT
What's a word for squadrons that?	O
Is still long.	CHITCHAT
Battalion.	O
I think we're going to go with.	CHITCHAT
OK, so in that video what I'm seeing anyway, all I can really say is what I'm seeing and the thing that I'm seeing most.	O
What I'm seeing most is.	CHITCHAT
We've got.	CHITCHAT
A plate step one make a plate step to reveal the plate then.	O
Make the play to different.	O
Color.	O
So let's try to do those.	O
Let's try to do these things.	CHITCHAT
There is a little bit of a particle spray as as the things coming on, but let's try to make this happen.	O
So we can do I don't know, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Fight mates battle Toms Battalion.	O
Uh, sorry we can't be Star Wars Battalion.	O
I think that's already a desired desired name.	CHITCHAT

A.	CHITCHAT
Well it's here now so oopsy.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to never stop laughing at my own.	CHITCHAT
Terrible choices.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Blah blah blah blah blah.	CHITCHAT
Close enough, OK.	CHITCHAT
Good plate plate accomplished when we're done with this, please don't Sue Me, Lucas.	O
Who am I kidding?	CHITCHAT
Space fight fight mates.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm happy with this.	CHITCHAT
This is our plate OK and.	O
Space yacht anyway.	O
So we got this and a few things happen to it right.	O
The main thing that happens is a wipe.	O
And then a.	CHITCHAT
Color change will say occurs to it.	O
So if you want to have birthday yards.	O
If you want to have this thing wipe on, it could be pretty easy.	O
There are many wipes that we might enjoy.	O
You might just use a mask, right?	O
And that might be a good way to start.	O
And I say start because.	CHITCHAT
You want to when you're working on a look like this rather than replicating it right?	O
So knowing how to replicate something is great, but how would we approach a similar problem from the ground up right, knowing that there's a certain look we want to get to?	O
How do we work up to that?	O
While giving us ourselves flexibility, right?	O
Don't start with the details.	O
Start with the basics and part of that.	O
For me anyway is to start by.	CHITCHAT
Figuring out how we want to reveal this now in that example.	O
There are some interesting clues to observe, but one of the things that's kind of interesting about this is that has these kinds of Brushy.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Slashes through it.	O
These like brushed on.	O
Looks you know which.	CHITCHAT
Just thinking, I'm just thinking how to do should just open up photo shop and start brushing.	O
Does that make sense?	O
Would that make the most sense 'cause we need something brushy, right?	O
We know this because in order to get these kind of streaks, that's one way to do it.	O
Tisk tisk tisk And is itself doesn't need to change.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't need to change what it needs to do.	O
Is just move.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Do you?	CHITCHAT
You know, I use the old Wacom paddle out when I blow dust office.	O
OK Boo.	CHITCHAT

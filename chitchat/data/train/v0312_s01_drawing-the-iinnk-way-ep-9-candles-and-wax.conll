And of course if you guys have any questions of art tattoo and feel free to ask.	O
When and grab my Adobe jacket.	O
Of all jackets.	CHITCHAT
You can't see that.	CHITCHAT
But all this is so warm, so anyway, so I can say we're drawing.	CHITCHAT
Were drawing candles today that the big you know, I.	O
I'm a firm believer in practice and I'm a firm believer in practicing all things as you don't practice that often or practice things you don't know how to draw because that's the biggest problem that we run into.	O
When it comes to art, as people are always looking for things to draw, when you should never have to ask, what should I draw?	CHITCHAT
Because you draw things as you don't know how to draw.	CHITCHAT
And if it ultimately overall makes you a better artist.	CHITCHAT
But trying to get someone to do that.	CHITCHAT
You will learn is like pulling teeth and is like the hardest thing in the world to get someone to.	CHITCHAT
Draw Something they don't know how to draw.	CHITCHAT
We typically.	CHITCHAT
Conform to our.	CHITCHAT
Comfort zone and we stay there.	CHITCHAT
And it's very hard to get outside of that when it's time.	CHITCHAT
And then it could become a huge burden later on.	CHITCHAT
So I personally.	CHITCHAT
Suggest doing it.	CHITCHAT
Very early.	CHITCHAT
Just to not form a habit.	CHITCHAT
Some people don't think they draw on things like.	O
Candles and stuff like that.	O
Hold any weight.	CHITCHAT
Or they have no, they have no.	CHITCHAT
Real like.	CHITCHAT
In comparison to other things that you do, they have no real like urgency to learn and I used to think that too.	CHITCHAT
I used to think things like this.	CHITCHAT
Just really didn't have a.	CHITCHAT
You know I could have been drawing or learning many other things rather than learning how to draw candles.	O
Or any inanimate object for that matter.	O
You know it could be napkins on the table.	O
It could be a pencil.	O
It could be literally anything.	O
That is inanimate or something that is probably like you know that you probably overlook on your daily life that you don't think would make a big deal to learn how to draw.	O
But the reason why we expressed so much about people learning how to draw things that.	CHITCHAT
You probably overlook, I mean like everybody does trees and stuff like that was this landscaping and things.	CHITCHAT
But you know, no one thinks about you know like a toilet paper roll or something like that because they don't see that being like something they would just go and rush to draw a right away but.	CHITCHAT
The effectiveness to draw those in the background of your drawing is just as important is drawing.	O
You know whatever the focal point of your drawing is.	O
Things like this, especially in tattooing, could make or break the peace meaning, uhm.	O
Something like this could could be the difference between the peace having a nice filigree layer.	O
And being held together very well, which makes the peace look very uniform professional, which of course I India ultimately ends up with you making more money because the more people see you.	O
As as a more professional and your artwork looks a lot more refined, the more people that will actually pay you to tattoo them.	O
Your ability to take the most mundane everyday thing and turn it.	CHITCHAT
You know on his head and make it look nice.	CHITCHAT
It also become A plus when you're doing tattooing.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
There are people that actually do like actual candle tattoos, so generally whenever I talk about drawing inanimate objects or whatever, always bring up candles because people don't necessarily study candles and I think handles or like something that's really important when it comes to like understanding how something that's so overlooked or like.

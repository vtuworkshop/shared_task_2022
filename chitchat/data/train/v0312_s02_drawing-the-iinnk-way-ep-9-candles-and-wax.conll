So I don't know insignificant in your daily life could teach you so much about form and stuff like that, especially when you're when you're dealing with drawing candle wax like melting and stuff like that.	O
Understanding.	CHITCHAT
How actual candle wax works?	O
Is actually rather funny, you know.	CHITCHAT
Because it covers a lot of textures, you know the melting part of it?	O
Could teach you a lot about other kind of like material like goo or something like that.	CHITCHAT
You know it's also a solid.	O
So it teaches you how to make things like look a certain way, but understanding that they hold their place and things like that.	O
You know, but like I said, it's something really insignificant.	CHITCHAT
You really kind of overlook it, which you shouldn't.	CHITCHAT
But also, I always recommend drawing things like this once I get my village.	CHITCHAT
Rodney, as we might draw some bats or something like that.	CHITCHAT
That's something else that always encourage people to work on.	CHITCHAT
Is like drawing animals or things like that.	CHITCHAT
And like all of these things kind of come into play when I do tattooing.	CHITCHAT
So normally when I don't have anything to draw, always think like what?	CHITCHAT
Is something that I could practice that could be utilized in my profession, you know?	CHITCHAT
Since I don't necessarily know what's going to come through the door.	CHITCHAT
'cause tattoo artist get a lot of weird requests all the time and since I don't know necessarily was going to walk through the door, I generally try to prepare myself for everything.	CHITCHAT
And since there's such a wide variety of things that people can ask for, you can never be.	CHITCHAT
Two prepared.	CHITCHAT
So I take this, I take my time.	CHITCHAT
As much as possible and I try to draw all manner of things, even the more and more, I think people won't ask for it.	CHITCHAT
The more and more I will draw it.	CHITCHAT
Because it's always the thing you don't ask for that they actually ask for.	CHITCHAT
All these are the things that you don't draw is what they will ask for all the time you get people coming in, asking for the weirdest of things that you don't understand.	CHITCHAT
But that's The thing is like most of these people that will come to see you as a tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Artists, they are not artists.	CHITCHAT
Yet they have vivid imaginations and being an being, it being a non artist and having a vivid imagination.	CHITCHAT
Would normally frustrate the hell out of an artist simply because an artist doesn't like.	CHITCHAT
It's just like doing um like graphic design and having an artists are they explain to you how to how they want their logo to look, or how they want whatever product that they want and you're looking at him like you're putting 10 pounds of crap in a 2 pound bag and they don't necessarily understand why all of this stuff.	CHITCHAT
Won't work for their image, and as a professional you explain to them composition and things like that.	CHITCHAT
With tattooing as heightened because you're trying to teach someone that this is not going to fit on your body in this in this.	CHITCHAT
Manner so to speak, and people typically just don't want to understand that if you tell them hey, you can't, you can't do this.	CHITCHAT
The average person does not want to hear you can't, specially when they're paying their money.	CHITCHAT
All they want to hear is how are you going to do it?	CHITCHAT
And how long is going to take?	CHITCHAT
And sometimes sometimes as a professional, you have to actually stop yourself and be like look, listen, you know.	CHITCHAT
I could easily take money.	CHITCHAT
From this port.	CHITCHAT
Person you know?	CHITCHAT
Or I could actually educate this person and let them know that.	CHITCHAT
What they are asking for.	CHITCHAT
May not work, it may cost you.	CHITCHAT
A client.	CHITCHAT
But in the long run.	CHITCHAT
Something like that will be highly beneficial.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of people don't necessarily see that.	CHITCHAT
When they first start off, specially in tattooing because when you first start off you just want to make money.	CHITCHAT
And then when someone comes in, they ask for something ridiculous is just like, well, it's not my body as you grow older and you mature, you understand that everything you do.	CHITCHAT
Typically has an effect on your career and you don't want to put your career in jeopardy.	CHITCHAT
Nor do you want to put the client's body in Jeopardy.	CHITCHAT
Just being a yes man and just saying whatever the heck they want.	CHITCHAT

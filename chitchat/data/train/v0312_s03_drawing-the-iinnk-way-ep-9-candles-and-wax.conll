If they come to you and they say they want something that's very very horrible.	CHITCHAT
You just kind of go along with it 'cause you want to make money.	CHITCHAT
After a while you have to stop yourself and be like, OK, look.	CHITCHAT
I know I want to do this.	CHITCHAT
I definitely need the money.	CHITCHAT
You know, but.	CHITCHAT
I also want to.	CHITCHAT
I also want to have akarere later on, you know, and then you have to let them know this isn't going to work.	CHITCHAT
This is why and if they still don't understand, you have to tell them that.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm not the artist for you.	CHITCHAT
And let them walk away.	CHITCHAT
Is the same concept when you're doing any other form of art you know?	CHITCHAT
Some people are willing to just do anything, and that's great.	CHITCHAT
You know, like there's nothing wrong with that, but at a certain point, you have to actually be able.	CHITCHAT
To tell client.	CHITCHAT
No, or that's not going to work or explain was bit with what you believe you can do.	CHITCHAT
To the best of your ability, which is generally what it comes down to.	CHITCHAT
What can you do?	CHITCHAT
To the best of your ability.	CHITCHAT
Understand what your abilities are.	CHITCHAT
And work on them.	CHITCHAT
You know from that perspective you know for me, I practice every single day.	CHITCHAT
I know there's a lot of people that just don't do that, and that's why I always push the idea so much.	CHITCHAT
It's like listen.	CHITCHAT
I understand that it's boring.	CHITCHAT
I understand that most of your life practice has been has been diluted down to drawing.	CHITCHAT
Boring life like like steel.	CHITCHAT
Life.	CHITCHAT
Based on realism type stuff.	CHITCHAT
If that's not your Cup of tea, generally it could seem kind of boring the lot of times when I was younger, what they used to teach me or what they used to tell me.	CHITCHAT
Was you gotta practice?	CHITCHAT
Like when you practice, fundamentals is all of the stuff that you necessarily.	CHITCHAT
You don't necessarily want to do, but you know you're going to need it.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of what I was always told was, you know, lighting and and when they told me about composition, no one ever really told me what composition was, you know, and I didn't really care to know all the big artsy words a lot of times they would tell me stuff and of course they like a lot of people are very bad at explaining the thing that sucks is when your teacher.	CHITCHAT
Is the one that's bad at explaining?	CHITCHAT
And you're trying to get the understanding of something that's going on in.	CHITCHAT
Your teacher is just a very horrible explainer.	CHITCHAT
Which happens a lot.	CHITCHAT
My teacher just have one of those attitudes I've had a couple good are teachers in my time, so let me give.	CHITCHAT
Don't let me don't let me confuse you or don't let me get it wrong but I had.	CHITCHAT
I have had a couple teachers they just did not get it.	CHITCHAT
Not when I say he did not get it just.	CHITCHAT
For some crazy reason.	CHITCHAT
The way that they, the way that they would go about teaching art is that of.	CHITCHAT
Eh?	CHITCHAT
Person that has already given up art, but there too far into it.	CHITCHAT
To stop doing it.	CHITCHAT
So they give you the boring.	CHITCHAT
Whatever type art lessons and stuff like that or they tell you to do things like.	CHITCHAT
What's the?	CHITCHAT
What's the one?	CHITCHAT
One practice they always make you do the bowl of fruit thing where they stick a bowl of fruit in front of you and they say draw this and make it look as realistic as possible, but they don't teach you anything about fundamentals.	CHITCHAT
They don't teach you anything about lighting, they don't teach you anything about form.	CHITCHAT
They just put a bowl of fruit or they put a light.	CHITCHAT
They put a lap pointed at something in the cast, a shadow like almost on a ball or something like that, and they say draw this.	CHITCHAT
You know, that's an easy way to get kids to spend the majority of their class not bothering you.	CHITCHAT
As an art teacher, but like see for me.	CHITCHAT
I'm like I'm trying to understand what this is going to teach me in and why can I draw superheroes and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
You know, my teachers were always pretty good at telling you if you don't do it, you're not going to be a great artist.	CHITCHAT
Good artist do this.	CHITCHAT
All of this ridiculous stuff so.	CHITCHAT
Of course, naturally when I'm in school, I'm rejecting all of this.	CHITCHAT
You know, and I'm trying to find.	CHITCHAT
Different ways to learn stuff.	CHITCHAT
And it became increasingly hard.	CHITCHAT

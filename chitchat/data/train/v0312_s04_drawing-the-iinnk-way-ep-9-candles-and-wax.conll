To do so.	CHITCHAT
And it used to make me really, really mad because I just.	CHITCHAT
I just never understood why.	CHITCHAT
I was in a classroom full of a bunch of people that didn't care about art yet.	CHITCHAT
We were all learning at the same level.	CHITCHAT
Not really sure if any of you guys ever experienced this in art class.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully not, but I had art one.	CHITCHAT
Drawing one drawing too, and then ultimately studio.	CHITCHAT
AP Studio AP was literally.	CHITCHAT
The the class that I love the most because studio AP was just making a college portfolio.	CHITCHAT
Not sure if any of you guys in high school actually had that or they actually allowed you.	CHITCHAT
To take an AP class, but once you once you fulfill all your credits, they allow you or you either you fulfill all your credits or you get to a certain point in what in a certain field of learning where they get you prepped for college.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
And those are AP courses.	CHITCHAT
So I had studio AP which is basically like sitting in the classroom and create a portfolio.	CHITCHAT
For college And you know, so on and so forth, which I thought was like, really cool, um?	CHITCHAT
But I didn't really know much about what college would want, and they don't, you know, like your teachers and The funny thing is, your teacher doesn't necessarily know what you need for college.	CHITCHAT
They just they just want you to start working on something.	CHITCHAT
So you just pretty much draw whatever it is that you need, you know.	CHITCHAT
Far as you think would impress a college.	CHITCHAT
The thing is, is that I always in my brain.	CHITCHAT
I was like, well, I mean, I'm I'm going to be paying for college, so why should I be drawing things to show them?	CHITCHAT
My skill set when I'm basically going to be paying to go.	CHITCHAT
You know, I was never really thinking like I'm going to get a scholarship or anything like that, you know?	CHITCHAT
Ultimately, I ended up going to the ER.	CHITCHAT
I think it was like the Art Institute of Southern Nevada.	CHITCHAT
You know, which is basically like our art school.	CHITCHAT
Today that I ended up deciding I was not going to go to college because of all of the crap that people told me about.	CHITCHAT
Like they're making you take all of these regular mundane classes alongside your art class to get a degree.	CHITCHAT
and I just got tired of all the.	CHITCHAT
The extra you know.	CHITCHAT
So anyway that went to Art Institute of Southern Nevada for about a month.	CHITCHAT
Until I realized that they weren't actually what I was actually seeking.	CHITCHAT
From college.	CHITCHAT
I should have known I wasn't going to be able to find in college.	CHITCHAT
You know what I was actually seeking was.	CHITCHAT
A style.	CHITCHAT
I was trying to in like you know, enhance my style or improve up on my style.	CHITCHAT
And I didn't necessarily understand that you can just do that by going.	CHITCHAT
You can't.	CHITCHAT
You can't go to school.	CHITCHAT
An and learn a file.	CHITCHAT
School teaches you if anything else fundamentals and it gives you a lot of connections and it gets you, gets you ready for the business side of Art.	CHITCHAT
The creative side of art comes from you.	CHITCHAT
Because it's in your brain, you know you definitely get a lot of you.	CHITCHAT
Definitely meet a lot of people that.	CHITCHAT
May that may be useful later on in the world, you know, because everybody needs connections and stuff like that and you could definitely make some pretty good connections if you went to college.	CHITCHAT
And for the most part, nasty.	CHITCHAT
Let the only thing I've ever really seen useful out of going to college again.	CHITCHAT
I only went for a month.	CHITCHAT
You know, the rest of the rest of my art career in life has been self taught.	CHITCHAT
Just simply because I just wanted to draw what I wanted to draw.	CHITCHAT
My teacher told me I was never going to be a good artist because I didn't know how to listen and I.	CHITCHAT
Of course, at the time I was just kind of like whatever.	CHITCHAT
I don't care.	CHITCHAT
I want to draw cool teddy bears and stuff and make up.	CHITCHAT
I want to make really nice love notes to, you know, sneak to girls and put like really cool drawings in 'cause you know you know I wanted to wow girl with my art.	CHITCHAT
You know, and stuff like that that necessarily it didn't necessarily.	CHITCHAT
Do anything for my motivation, so to speak, and my wanting to.	CHITCHAT
How do I say my wanting to become more of an artist?	CHITCHAT

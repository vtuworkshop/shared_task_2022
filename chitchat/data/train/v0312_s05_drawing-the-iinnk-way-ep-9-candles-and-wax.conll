I never, ever, ever in my life intended to make any kind of money from my artwork as is most of the people that I knew.	CHITCHAT
We drew it for cloud or we drew it for attention.	CHITCHAT
We drew all the stuff that we did just so we could show people how good at art we were.	CHITCHAT
It had very, very little to do with making money and it became so it became such an obsession that we didn't necessarily even realize the level.	CHITCHAT
Of skill.	CHITCHAT
We were at.	CHITCHAT
At the time.	CHITCHAT
You know, nor do we even care as I got as I got older and people started telling me I was good.	CHITCHAT
I actually thought I actually thought I was like really bad, you know which I was.	CHITCHAT
You know, find out later.	CHITCHAT
I just really wasn't that I was better than most people.	CHITCHAT
But most people can't draw so that it's not a fair assumption.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's like, well, you know if you're better than most people you automatically did I was able to form shapes I was able to make pictures, but.	CHITCHAT
I was lacking in a lot of areas, you know, and of course you know when you're young and your and your impression of all or whatever, and people are telling you that you're good.	CHITCHAT
You as far as going to your hand, you could.	CHITCHAT
You could do one of two things.	CHITCHAT
It could make you really, really want to be an artist and really, really want to put your best foot forward and really, really, really want to do good or it could backfire.	CHITCHAT
And it could make you not want to do it at all, because you develop the superhero complex.	CHITCHAT
In the Super Hero Complex to me is basically people being told that they're good their entire life for their great or to have something special, and that they've been told that so much that.	CHITCHAT
Now they just don't want to do it, they just want to be normal, you know, and in that in the in the pursuit of being normal.	CHITCHAT
They.	CHITCHAT
Basically Duluth themselves or they miss out on a lot of opportunities to be great at something.	CHITCHAT
Because they don't want to be great, they just want to be normal.	CHITCHAT
They just want to blend in.	CHITCHAT
You know, just so that they can be to themselves or whatever.	CHITCHAT
And I always kind of found that to be weird, but I experienced you know that a certain point where it was like I just wanted this for me.	CHITCHAT
And because everybody thought I was, you know, starting to get good.	CHITCHAT
Everybody wanted to tell me what to do with my art career and where I should go in R and what I should do.	CHITCHAT
And, you know, it's I was always everybody else will always lead you toward money.	CHITCHAT
That's the thing you're going to learn when you when you start doing artists, the majority of people will always try to lead you toward money.	CHITCHAT
You know I will.	CHITCHAT
I will be the first person to tell you that money is great in art.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I mean, if you can make it cool, but it if you haven't heard before that.	CHITCHAT
You should not go into art for money.	CHITCHAT
Let me be one of the first people to tell you.	CHITCHAT
You should not go into our for money and I'm pretty sure you'll ask why?	CHITCHAT
Because if you go into art for money 9 times outta 10, you will not make any money and the reason for that is you go into are expected to make money.	CHITCHAT
Everything you do will be based on whether or not you can make money and it does not help you enhance your skills.	CHITCHAT
If all you keep thinking about is can I make money from this.	CHITCHAT
Is the same thing as if you want to work for a company, I want to work for Blizzard and you keep telling yourself.	CHITCHAT
Well if I do this I'll be able to work for Blizzard.	CHITCHAT
But you never, ever, ever actually stop to think like, Well, you know if I'm going to work for Blizzard, I have to have something that Blizzard hasn't seen before.	CHITCHAT
Because you have a goo gobs of people lining up to work for Blizzard, why am I the exception?	CHITCHAT
YMI any different?	CHITCHAT
Why would Blizzard wants to hire me?	CHITCHAT
Know one things like that?	CHITCHAT
Everybody always thinks that it would be a privilege for someone to have me, you know, or the opposite.	CHITCHAT
No one ever done was ever going to want me.	CHITCHAT
I suck, blah blah blah.	CHITCHAT
Most of the time it's the latter, you know, but.	CHITCHAT
You also have artists been in the majority of the beginning of their karere searching for a style because no one's ever told them You can't find the style.	CHITCHAT
Style has to find you.	CHITCHAT
And they don't never.	CHITCHAT
They never actually explain to you that style comes from years and years of study.	CHITCHAT

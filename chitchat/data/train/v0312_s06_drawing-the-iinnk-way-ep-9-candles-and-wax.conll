The people you study, the places you've gone, the things you've seen, the experiences you have it, all it all plays a big part in the things that you draw and the way that you draw them.	CHITCHAT
The active pursuit of these things.	CHITCHAT
Our would drive you mad and make you feel like you just you just never going to never going to be good enough, you know or I'm going to suck forever and it's like it's not.	CHITCHAT
It's really, really hard to get someone to understand that you know it's like it's not about being.	CHITCHAT
It's not about being great 'cause you don't necessarily know.	CHITCHAT
How great you are in a sense of.	CHITCHAT
Like I mean, you know how you want your art to look, so to speak.	CHITCHAT
Let me put like that.	CHITCHAT
You know exactly how you want your art to look, but a lot of times that is based on what you expect other people to life from your art.	CHITCHAT
Which is where the problem comes in, because you should never put yourself.	CHITCHAT
It is situation.	CHITCHAT
Where you let others dictate what you do with your art, you know.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately I have a lot of us do a lot of us get stuck in that these people are doing this so I should be doing it for this person.	CHITCHAT
Said I shouldn't do that, you know which ultimately is bogus.	CHITCHAT
You will always get somebody, especially if it's somebody that stands to gain or stands to stands to empower themselves by bringing you down, you know there you will always meet people that will tell you shouldn't do things in art.	CHITCHAT
Certain things are cheating.	CHITCHAT
Stuff like that you know, and as you grow older and you Start learning and you start finding new people that you idolize.	CHITCHAT
You start understanding that the stuff that you were told wasn't true.	CHITCHAT
You know there is no cheating in art.	CHITCHAT
It's art you draw, you paint, you sculpt, you photograph.	CHITCHAT
You do all of these things and.	CHITCHAT
The one thing that you realize is that these things ultimately will make you better all around.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
So if it makes you better all around, how could any of it, if ever be considered cheating?	CHITCHAT
You know, even Tracy.	CHITCHAT
People consistently and I hear this alot.	CHITCHAT
They consistently say that tracing is cheating.	CHITCHAT
Yet they completely.	CHITCHAT
Stuff tattooing in a different category.	CHITCHAT
You know, even though tattooing is definitely 100% Tracy.	CHITCHAT
You know, yes, you could be tracing your own work, you know, so there's that.	CHITCHAT
But most of the time you're not.	CHITCHAT
Most of the time tattoo artists you know or tattoo with?	CHITCHAT
Should I say, because there are two different terms a tattoo artist is someone that, well, you know there.	CHITCHAT
An artist that tattoos and a tattooist is just someone that tattoos they.	CHITCHAT
They know they know the technical side of tattooing and they're going to apply tattoos very well.	CHITCHAT
A tattoo IST.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much either has a select amount of imagery that they use or.	CHITCHAT
You know, or someone brings something into him in a tattoo it.	CHITCHAT
Or you could be the other end of the spectrum which is a tattoo artist.	CHITCHAT
Which.	CHITCHAT
Basically, you draw euros.	CHITCHAT
You basically you know how to tattoo really well and you can draw your own stuff.	CHITCHAT
You're more into the creative side and the experimental side of tattooing.	CHITCHAT
Versus just.	CHITCHAT
Reproducing images you know both have a re both have a reason in a meaning for existing.	CHITCHAT
You know, the only problem is is.	CHITCHAT
If you are very impressionable, you will get the impression that one is not as valuable as the other.	CHITCHAT
I personally think that you should have some art skill.	CHITCHAT
If you're going to tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Because there are going to be times where you are going to have to utilize your art skills in order to get through.	CHITCHAT
Get you through something, especially if you're doing a tattoo and your stencil wipes off.	CHITCHAT
And this happens a lot when you're beginning artists and you have no idea what to do because you didn't draw the peace.	CHITCHAT
And I've had this happen before.	CHITCHAT
Actually had to happen on my first piece and I didn't know what to do when I was like Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, I just I just I just wipe my stencil off and I don't know.	CHITCHAT

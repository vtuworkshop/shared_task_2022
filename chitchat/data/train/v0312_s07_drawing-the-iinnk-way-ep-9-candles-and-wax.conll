I don't know what to do.	CHITCHAT
I was like but Luckily I drew it so I just kind of threw it back on.	CHITCHAT
But for that brief amount of time I was just like, whoa, this could actually happen while I'm going to shop.	CHITCHAT
With a client and that could be bad.	CHITCHAT
You know what I definitely don't want to happen is for me to be with a client or in a shop or whatever, and then I.	CHITCHAT
Do something really bad and I can't fix it because I have I don't have the skill to do it.	CHITCHAT
So I refrain from doing a lot of stuff.	CHITCHAT
That I knew I couldn't do.	CHITCHAT
Unless I had the skill set, I can now do it, but back then it was like.	CHITCHAT
All it took was from one time for me to do something and just be like holy crap.	CHITCHAT
This could have been way worse.	CHITCHAT
I need to probably stop and learn.	CHITCHAT
Most tattoo artist don't do that.	CHITCHAT
They don't care, they just kind of like whatever.	CHITCHAT
If I mess up, this person won't come back an well.	CHITCHAT
I don't have to deal with them, You know, and with sad is that they.	CHITCHAT
A lot of 'em.	CHITCHAT
Not every tattoo artist 'cause they're of course.	CHITCHAT
There are great tattoo artists out there, but a lot of them they look at it like.	CHITCHAT
Or what I've actually run into is they look at it as if.	CHITCHAT
It's which is supposed to do, meaning you're supposed to learn.	CHITCHAT
How to draw?	CHITCHAT
On people, this is their brain is like, well I'm going to learn how to do drawing in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
And get paid for it at the same time.	CHITCHAT
Add.	CHITCHAT
Ultimately, it's something that's taught to them.	CHITCHAT
Ultimately, in a nutshell, it is taught to them that.	CHITCHAT
You're here to get paid, you know, make your money and learn what you're doing while you're doing it.	CHITCHAT
Like a hone, your skills you know.	CHITCHAT
And while you're holding your skills, get paid.	CHITCHAT
You know the shop wants you to make money or the shop isn't going to have you, so you know unless you're in.	CHITCHAT
Unless you're in a good shop, most good shops will be like clicked on tattoo anybody until you get better.	CHITCHAT
You know if you're in a print isn't in your art.	CHITCHAT
Teacher is teaching you nothing but tattooing, but they're not teaching, you are, and you're bad at art.	CHITCHAT
That's not a good teacher.	CHITCHAT
If your mentor in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
Hasn't recognized that your skills may need a little polishing, and if they are even worse, they do realize that they need a little policy, but they don't make you polished him.	CHITCHAT
That's not necessarily a good teacher.	CHITCHAT
And you definitely don't want to be stuck in an environment where you don't stand to learn anything.	CHITCHAT
You know even something as simple as this right here would could be easily overlooked because it's just a candle you know.	CHITCHAT
But like I said, I make I make, I make it a purpose to emphasize the importance of drawing things like.	CHITCHAT
Candles or inanimate objects all the time.	CHITCHAT
For tattoo artists, because you definitely don't know what's going to walk through the door.	CHITCHAT
And the crazy thing is, a lot of people just literally don't understand.	CHITCHAT
Like Knowing how to draw everything and when I say everything, I mean everything.	CHITCHAT
The fastest of the fasces to the dirtiest of The Dirty.	CHITCHAT
You should know how to draw.	CHITCHAT
Because you don't know what's going to walk through the doors.	CHITCHAT
The same thing to be saying any other art form or any other form of art that you may take on is that you have no idea how people are going to.	CHITCHAT
Approach you with their work and you have no idea what they're going to ask you to do.	CHITCHAT
So because you don't know how, you have no idea what they're going to ask you to do, you should be prepared to do anything they ask you to do.	CHITCHAT
You're getting paid hundreds of dollars an hour in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
This is this is known because once you get to a specific level, you stop charging by the peace.	CHITCHAT
This is what I've learned about tattooing.	CHITCHAT
When you guys have never dealt with it or thought about doing it, the first thing that I learned about tattooing is there's faces that you go through.	CHITCHAT
Your apprenticeship phase is just a learning phase.	CHITCHAT
You probably aren't going to be making any money doing that, it's an apprenticeship.	CHITCHAT
If you have a good mentor, they won't let you make money doing it because you're learning.	CHITCHAT
You know, once you get past the learning phase you get, you get to that.	CHITCHAT
Beginner phase where is basically like you do anything that walks through the door to familiarize yourself with all the different styles and all of the different BS are going to deal with in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
BS is going to be a huge thing you deal with.	CHITCHAT
What I mean by huge is like.	CHITCHAT

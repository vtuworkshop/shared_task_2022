The about of stuff you're going to deal with in tattooing.	CHITCHAT
That is complete BS.	CHITCHAT
Is shocking.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of that comes from the fact that a lot of people don't necessarily understand how to teach.	CHITCHAT
So they BS you alive, you know.	CHITCHAT
You have to know how that you have to know how to talk to your clients and you have to know how to talk to your owner, your shop.	CHITCHAT
You have to understand how to conduct yourself in such a manner of business that.	CHITCHAT
A person will take you seriously.	CHITCHAT
You know a person is going to take you not as a joke.	CHITCHAT
You know which I mean.	CHITCHAT
Granite If you've never been in it, you don't necessarily know how to approach people like that, but one of the things that that you definitely don't want to get caught up in is the whole, you know.	CHITCHAT
Thing that happens when you first start drawing or you first start doing anything for money and you get people take advantage of you.	CHITCHAT
They will mislead you because like a lot of people want a lot of people want to profit and if they can profit from you, um, it's easier from it's easier for them to make money.	CHITCHAT
Off of you, rather than doing it themselves, especially if you have better skills than them, that's another thing you have to watch for.	CHITCHAT
Even though you might not own a business.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
It doesn't necessarily mean that you don't have the skill set like.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to scare anybody.	CHITCHAT
Is thinking about getting into tattooing or whatever.	CHITCHAT
It is a great business ultimately.	CHITCHAT
The majority of it I would say.	CHITCHAT
85% of it is awesome.	CHITCHAT
But the other 15% is still with.	CHITCHAT
You have to lookout for a lot of people don't.	CHITCHAT
And those people end up having the horror stories like I had.	CHITCHAT
Where you get into, you get into.	CHITCHAT
A field, and you expect it to be a specific way, and ultimately your ultimate the ultimate end to all of that is you end up going through a lot of suffering for no apparent reason.	CHITCHAT
They could easily have been avoided if you had not had shady like underhanded people around you, but at the same time, if you had a better knowledge of your business and what you were doing, you could have seen it coming when I first started.	CHITCHAT
I want it after I after I started the the wrong way and decided to do it the right way.	CHITCHAT
I realized I knew nothing about what I was, what I was trying to do.	CHITCHAT
You know, as much as I wanted to ego myself through it, I had no idea what I was doing and I needed to learn.	CHITCHAT
So I stopped.	CHITCHAT
Actually which a lot of people are not going to do.	CHITCHAT
You're not going to stop tattooing to learn, you're just going to keep going and be like Oh well, hopefully all of you guys out there to get tattooed by me.	CHITCHAT
I won't screw up.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of how you come into it.	CHITCHAT
After awhile, you know you change that tune because you're like well, this is mycareer.	CHITCHAT
You know it's the same thing with art when you first start and you get into art you see so many people doing cool stuff all you want to do is do cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
As you get better at your craft, you stop wanting to do cool stuff and you just want to make you.	CHITCHAT
You know you want to.	CHITCHAT
You want to make your skills go up because you know that if you get your skills up, the cool stuff is automatic, you know.	CHITCHAT
If you want to draw anime characters, you know you ultimately understand that knowing better anatomy or stuff like that will help you draw better anime or comic or anything like that is the same thing to be said, for tattooing, the more you know about art from every aspect.	CHITCHAT
The better you are attacking with, you know.	CHITCHAT
The more you can make like like what I'm doing right now.	CHITCHAT
The more you can make a candle look like a candle you know and look like it's melting V.	CHITCHAT
Better.	CHITCHAT
Your tattoos will look, you know now.	CHITCHAT
For the most part.	CHITCHAT
Something like this isn't isn't going to be the major like a major part of what you tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Is going to be every now and again every blue moon.	CHITCHAT
But is the blue moon tattoos that actually make you the most money, which is generally why you want to learn him?	CHITCHAT

The tattoos that come into play that.	O
You I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to figure out the best way to explain it.	CHITCHAT
You have your dream tattoos that are basically like things you know will put you on the map and that will ultimately get you the ability to flex your scale and then you have bill paying tattoos which is like 90% of whatever comes through the door you know.	O
Both people come to the tattoo shop in droves.	CHITCHAT
You will have lines of people waiting to get tattooed within a busy day.	CHITCHAT
If your tattoo shop is really known, you ultimately have.	CHITCHAT
I don't know tons and tons and tons of people that.	CHITCHAT
Generally just want to get something done and they don't necessarily know what they want and they are there for you to convince them or they actually know exactly what they want and they just want to know if you can do it.	CHITCHAT
The thing that I ran into the most is a lot of people that know what they want.	CHITCHAT
You don't necessarily have that much of a discussion is can you do this?	CHITCHAT
I want this here and your biggest discussion is whether or not it's going to fit in that area of person that knows what they want.	CHITCHAT
Will haggle you about placement.	CHITCHAT
You know placement is key because you have to understand that everything on the body is a circle, you know, so it will wrap around eventually an hit another part of the body you know are the same part that you are actually working on, you know.	O
Say someone wants something on their wrist, right and it's too big to fit on their wrist or it?	O
Won't fit inbetween whatever tattoos they have there and stuff like that or whatever.	O
If you say yes, I'll do this.	O
You are ultimately agreeing that you can make this go where they wanted to go.	O
And some people would do that not knowing that if you say yes and you cannot make it go where you wanted to go or where they wanted to go, it's going to eventually.	CHITCHAT
That kind of stuff can easily ruin your career, you know, because people will basically blame you for their but their their choice in the tattoo because you're the professional and they're going to say you could have told them now.	CHITCHAT
Granted, they're going to argue with you about placement and argue with you about where it should be, but as a professional, you.	CHITCHAT
Ultimately, have to make the decision to not want to do taxes.	CHITCHAT
You know, that's kind of how it comes down to it is like, OK, I want my girlfriends name on my face and you're like you know you sure you want to do that.	CHITCHAT
You know, of course, they're going to be like, Yeah, I love this woman blah blah blah you know and you're like Well, you know maybe you should put it somewhere else besides your face you know just a statically it would look better here.	CHITCHAT
Now, of course, that doesn't matter, you know.	CHITCHAT
But what you're basically doing is causing them.	CHITCHAT
They have to come back later.	CHITCHAT
And get it removed or whatnot.	CHITCHAT
They're going to, you know.	CHITCHAT
And of course you got you got it.	CHITCHAT
You got to make it seem like it's not the ultimate.	CHITCHAT
You know you're doing something that probably isn't going to.	CHITCHAT
You're not going to be happy with this later.	CHITCHAT
Please do something else.	CHITCHAT
Type thing, 'cause if they know that you're doing that, they're going to be like no.	CHITCHAT
I want this, I'm sure of it.	CHITCHAT
I'm absolutely, positively sure of it.	CHITCHAT
I thought about it for the last 10 minutes.	CHITCHAT
Of course I know what I want, you know so.	CHITCHAT
What you basically do as you try to make it seem like it's you try to make it seem like it's not going to.	CHITCHAT
It's not going to look.	CHITCHAT
Artistically.	CHITCHAT
Like it could be, it could be.	CHITCHAT
It could be put somewhere that's so much better, you know and look so much better.	CHITCHAT
And then when you put it like that, they're like Oh OK, well, you're the professional.	CHITCHAT
Do what you want to do and it's like man.	CHITCHAT
If I if I did what I wanted to do you wouldn't be getting this but.	CHITCHAT
The other thing is you don't pass judgment.	CHITCHAT
You know this is with anything you do.	CHITCHAT
You know your opinion is welcome, but don't ever tell somebody that their art is are there idea is dumb.	CHITCHAT
That is a very that comes from a very arrogant place and I've been I've been a victim.	CHITCHAT
Or I've been out was not I wouldn't necessarily called being a victim.	CHITCHAT
I have been a.	CHITCHAT
I've done that to people I've actually told people that there are sucks in tattooing, which is never something that's OK to do, but I was young and you know, was Eragon.	CHITCHAT

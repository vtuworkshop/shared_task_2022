You know?	CHITCHAT
Some girl that I was actually.	CHITCHAT
Brought in a picture says she wanted it done.	CHITCHAT
Was very adamant about it, you know?	CHITCHAT
And I'm like looking at the picture and I'm just kind of like, you know, I was in.	CHITCHAT
I was in my artist phase.	CHITCHAT
So in my brain everything that I thought was better than everything that my clients wanted.	CHITCHAT
So um.	CHITCHAT
She showed me the peace and I'm just kind of looking at it like you man.	CHITCHAT
This is not good, you know?	CHITCHAT
And I'm like you sure you want this and she's like, yeah, and I'm like you do you mind if I like redraw or whatnot?	CHITCHAT
You know, to give it a little bit more of a balanced field or whatever.	CHITCHAT
And she's like, no, I'm sure I want exactly this and.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking it over and I'm just kind of like in my brain.	CHITCHAT
I'm like I'm not feeling this.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to put my name on this, you know, but all for all the wrong reasons.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm like people are going to see this.	CHITCHAT
They're going to, you know, like they.	CHITCHAT
The thing that I that I didn't know when I was younger is like it's not about you, but I'm sitting there and I'm just.	CHITCHAT
Finding trying to find ways to convince this.	CHITCHAT
This girl that you don't want to get this.	CHITCHAT
Ultimately, I just came out and was like.	CHITCHAT
Did I don't necessarily know if it's a good idea for you to get this.	CHITCHAT
This tattoo is crappy, you know.	CHITCHAT
And Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Haider Ali at the hope.	CHITCHAT
I hope I said your name right but how are you welcome and welcome to the chat?	CHITCHAT
If you have any questions feel free to ask you know so I told you I told you like yeah your tattoo is not good.	CHITCHAT
You know I'm not sure you should get this on you and she was like my grandma drew this.	CHITCHAT
You know she's dead and I was just like, oh.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, foot insert into mouth you know.	CHITCHAT
And but like I had been told before, so it wasn't like I didn't actually know not to do that.	CHITCHAT
It was just I was in my Eragon's phase.	CHITCHAT
So anything you told when you're younger or arrogant or you like, I don't know about you know if you guys, but I know that when I was younger and art there was a point where I just thought I was garbage and because I wasn't garbage anymore.	CHITCHAT
Obviously I was Great Ness.	CHITCHAT
That's the balance is like, Oh my God, my garbage anymore.	CHITCHAT
That means of the best.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't.	CHITCHAT
So I told him I told us very, very very very.	CHITCHAT
Cool young lady that her tattoo that she was going to get was dumb.	CHITCHAT
And it was her grandmas drawing.	CHITCHAT
As she drew for her when she was a little kid and it was one of the only things she had left of her grandma.	CHITCHAT
Is she wanted it on her body, you know, and I told her it was dumb.	CHITCHAT
You know and.	CHITCHAT
It was at that point that I realized that I.	CHITCHAT
Really need to revaluate how I looked at.	CHITCHAT
You know doing tattoos for people you know because I'm going into it thinking that I need.	CHITCHAT
To make this tattoo look good so I can win awards and then I can so I can get on TV and stuff like that when ultimately the tattoo has nothing to do with you has nothing to do with you at all whatsoever.	CHITCHAT
It is.	CHITCHAT
About the client.	CHITCHAT
And when you're learning, you don't think that way, or when you're coming up, you don't think that way.	CHITCHAT
You do not think this tattoo is is going to make my client feels so much better, and it's going to probably complete them and they they're on a journey.	CHITCHAT
And this might be the the final piece of their journey.	CHITCHAT
You're not thinking any of that.	CHITCHAT
What you're thinking is man.	CHITCHAT
When I finish this piece and I put it on my Instagram or.	CHITCHAT
Facebook or whatever you're using.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to get so much clout and I'm going to get so many people that want tattoos from me like that's what you think about almost every piece.	CHITCHAT
You know, but.	CHITCHAT
That is probably the worst thing you could possibly think.	CHITCHAT
Why?	CHITCHAT
Because it has nothing to do with any of that which you learn later on because you.	CHITCHAT
Stop looking at tattoo on your as your like your thing you know you start looking at tattooing as you know well they are paying me and it's their journey.	CHITCHAT
You know I'm using my art skills to take their journey to the next level, you know.	CHITCHAT
And if you can't, if you can't sign up for that, you have a problem that you need to deal with.	CHITCHAT

You know which is generally what you would you know like that's that soul searching, you know, gut checking.	CHITCHAT
Thing that you have to you have to level yourself into believing you know in order to do a job like that, you know yes you can be ego driven.	CHITCHAT
An yes people will get tattooed by but it is not going to make you a better artist.	O
It is going to hold you back so much that is unbelievable and people just don't get that.	O
The average person isn't going to be like I'm going to be if I don't.	O
If I don't do this the way they say it, I'm not going back.	O
That's not how most tattoo artist thing.	O
Most tattoo artists thinking, man, this is literally going to make a break.	O
Me and this person is trying to break me.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to get this person to get a really dope tattoo and they want to get this really crappy tattoo, but you don't necessarily know if that crappy tat tattoo has meaning or how could you determine that something is crappy when art is in the eye of the beholder.	CHITCHAT
If you are not the beholder.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
How can you determine it?	CHITCHAT
You know, like you can look at it and be like it's crap, but the other person that's paying you to do it may think that's like the greatest piece ever.	CHITCHAT
Some people like you know, that might be a fine art piece from history that someone might want that you might think nowadays is crappy because you do anime art, you know, or you do comic book art.	CHITCHAT
Or you do airbrushing or graffiti.	CHITCHAT
But the stuff that they want it doesn't seem like something that is cool to you, but it's world right now.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Like I love the Sistine Chapel.	CHITCHAT
You know I love the artist on the Sistine Chapel.	CHITCHAT
I just I like I like Michelangelo and Leonardo, Leonardo Davinci.	CHITCHAT
You know, I've always been a fan of debt.	CHITCHAT
Age of artwork or those specific artist that did the things they did not so much for the art that they do, even though they are that they did where it was amazing.	CHITCHAT
It was more so.	CHITCHAT
That the dedication that they put into the pieces that they did, you know, and that was kind of my thing, is like the Sistine Chapel in in.	CHITCHAT
In particular, you have to think took like I think they said it took like 10 years or something like that to do.	CHITCHAT
Like imagine being dedicated to one thing.	CHITCHAT
One of project for 10 years.	CHITCHAT
You know, because ultimately, we as we get older, every piece that we do is considered a project or whatever, and you know.	CHITCHAT
Like it's not the same as back then back then it was considered basically a well I got work.	CHITCHAT
You know they're paying me to do something.	CHITCHAT
I study every day.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people hire artists like do their their medical books and stuff like that because they didn't know how to draw human anatomy.	CHITCHAT
From what I heard.	CHITCHAT
Like They would actually pay.	CHITCHAT
The corner to open a cadaver so they could study muscle structure and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Imagine being that dedicated to your craft that you do things that other people might think is insanity.	CHITCHAT
And that's	CHITCHAT
That's art as Renaissance artists and stuff like that or that's older artist that didn't have the tools that we have.	CHITCHAT
Just like.	CHITCHAT
Just like we have digital tablets and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
People will overlook that and take it for granted all the time.	CHITCHAT
You know and.	CHITCHAT
It always makes me it always.	CHITCHAT
It always fills me with like some like sadness.	CHITCHAT
Even, even though even though every now and again it fills me with a bit of happiness to understand, you know that people are trying to.	CHITCHAT
Branch out and be more understanding of Art.	CHITCHAT
It also fills me with sadness 'cause a lot of people just don't care and they look at art as a way of making money and that way of making money.	CHITCHAT
Uh, is what ends up holding him back.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
If you actually gave two craps about the art and it wasn't about the money, you could easily see that the potential is endless.	CHITCHAT
Also, a lot of people will get into a certain.	CHITCHAT
Genre of art.	CHITCHAT
And get stuck there and they don't think that any other form of art is beneficial to learn.	CHITCHAT
I'm here to tell you that's not true if it.	CHITCHAT
If you're an experienced artist, you already know this so you know.	CHITCHAT
But if you're beginning artist, learn everything.	CHITCHAT
It all has something that's going to help you be better, like what I mean by that is like if you aren't a painter doesn't mean you can't learn painting.	CHITCHAT
Why would you want to learn it?	CHITCHAT
Simply because painting could help you be better at coloring, you know application of color.	CHITCHAT

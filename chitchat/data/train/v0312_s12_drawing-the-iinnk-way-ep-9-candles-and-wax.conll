You could actually teach you a lot about Hughes and values you know, which is something that was huge.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know what the hell that meant when I was doing when I first started doing art.	CHITCHAT
You know the art lingo and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I used to be like Miss me with that crap.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to learn this art lingo.	CHITCHAT
You know, I still don't know a lot of the art lingo just because I I'm a self taught an I just like to draw stuff.	CHITCHAT
You know, I didn't necessarily understand that from my perspective or from what I've gained are from what I've understand, are learning the art lingo.	CHITCHAT
Is is more so, so you can.	CHITCHAT
You can communicate with other artists.	CHITCHAT
You know it's just like it's just like trying to talk to someone that has a different language.	CHITCHAT
You must learn their language in order to speak to them sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Artists can familiarize themselves when you know how to speak to them.	CHITCHAT
In their lingo.	CHITCHAT
If I said junks to position and you don't know what that means, you're going to be like what?	CHITCHAT
I don't know what they meant for awhile.	CHITCHAT
I just thought it was something dumb and I'm like I don't like that word.	CHITCHAT
It just it sounds cool but it I don't know what it means.	CHITCHAT
You know like stuff like that it's like you don't necessarily need to learn the art lingo, but it is designed to help you understand when you're learning something.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
It's one of those.	CHITCHAT
It's art language that helps you understand when someone tells you that you have a lot of what was that I've always heard a lot.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
The heck is this word I'm trying to think of it, it's A.	CHITCHAT
Canyons.	CHITCHAT
You have a lot of tangents in your art and I'm just like thanks.	CHITCHAT
It's not a good thing.	CHITCHAT
It's not, you know it could be, but unless you, unless you typically meant for it to be done, from what I've gathered, a tangent a tangent is like a specific type of grouping of lines that you want to avoid having too many of.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
And I never thought about that.	CHITCHAT
If someone told you composition, you know.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And you didn't necessarily understand what that meant you be like Haha.	CHITCHAT
You know someone says you have great composition uh-huh thanks.	CHITCHAT
I workout.	CHITCHAT
You know, like you understanding what these things mean is very, very important.	CHITCHAT
You know, when speaking to other artists, and especially you learn that kind of stuff when you're in school and things like that, you know.	CHITCHAT
But When I was growing up and I didn't know any of that, does the one that I used to but I used to hate.	CHITCHAT
That I was here all the time that became my greatest, the greatest MMA crowning achievement of my improvement was fundamentals.	CHITCHAT
Any and everybody is an artist will hear this word.	CHITCHAT
And it depending on how you react to it.	CHITCHAT
It could be good, or it could be bad fun.	CHITCHAT
And if you don't understand what fundamentals are and you don't and you don't.	CHITCHAT
Pursue.	CHITCHAT
Learning fundamentals the way you should.	CHITCHAT
You will probably suffer a very long time in your in your art journey.	CHITCHAT
Everybody perceives, fundamentally, everybody perceives fundamentals in the understanding of fundamentals differently, you know.	CHITCHAT
It is to my knowledge.	CHITCHAT
From my experience that fundamentals.	CHITCHAT
Are the key asset.	CHITCHAT
Of teaching your hands.	CHITCHAT
To work with your brain.	CHITCHAT
The there are numerous exercises that will help teach you that that will help teach you the fundamentals of art, but generally most people don't know what fundamentals are.	CHITCHAT
When you sit down.	CHITCHAT
And you try to make your hands do something and they can't.	CHITCHAT
A lot of times because you haven't had enough fundamental practice that will become ultimately muscle memory, like how you see me drawing his little circles and all of these different shapes to make up this thing that would ultimately ultimately be looked at as a candle you don't understand it.	CHITCHAT
That's all fundamentals I had.	CHITCHAT
I used to have the biggest problem drawing anything.	CHITCHAT
Like this?	CHITCHAT
You know these are just candles, you know, but like we do a lot of different types of stuff, Indiana.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Into Like my practicing and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I have a I have a large variety of.	CHITCHAT

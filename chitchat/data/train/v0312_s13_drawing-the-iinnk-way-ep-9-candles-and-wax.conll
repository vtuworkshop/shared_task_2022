Tashi As you can see.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And majority of my tests are based on learning fundamentals without being boring about it, you know.	O
Telling people that if you want to learn how to draw Hulk hands, you don't necessarily have to do the boring stuff.	O
You can jump in and learn how to draw Hulk hands.	O
You know 'cause ultimately the first thing you want to learn is that art is supposed to be fun.	O
If you're not having fun.	CHITCHAT
What's the point?	CHITCHAT
But at the same time, when you draw a whole cans and you start understanding or you start realizing I can't draw this and why isn't it coming out riding while my struggling with this you will start to understand why you need to practice fundamentals because fundamentals will teach you why your fists look weird and why they don't.	O
Why you can't get them to do that?	CHITCHAT
That favorite poles of the Hulk where it looks like he's smashing through the ground?	O
And why can't you get the whole to look muscular the way he looks in other peoples comics and stuff like that and?	O
You start realizing that.	CHITCHAT
I don't understand form.	CHITCHAT
You know and and of course, before I can understand form, I have to understand how to make these things look the way they want to look, which ultimately leads back to holy crap.	O
I need to learn fundamentals, my fundamentals are off, you know.	O
And even though you've been told a million times in your brain, it was like I did not need this thing.	O
I did not need it.	CHITCHAT
I do not want it.	CHITCHAT
Why do you keep trying to give it to me?	O
You know, and then you get to a point where you're like I need this.	O
I need to do this more than I need to do regular art because regular are being things that you want to show off because practicing is a form of art like this kind of stuff is just as artistic as drawing this kind of stuff over here.	O
This is ultimately for the.	O
Van Or the non artist?	O
You know this kind of stuff over here is for the artist.	O
This is going to help artists get better, and it's going to help artists understand, you know.	O
I could care less about this kind of stuff over here.	O
I already know what this is going to do.	O
This is more entertaining to me because this breaks down and this makes me understand in.	O
This teaches me which is why I do more practice than I do anything else.	O
I just decided to make it more artistic and call it test sheets, but it's basically me practicing fundamentals.	O
It's no difference.	CHITCHAT
You know, is literally just me sitting there.	CHITCHAT
Figuring out how to draw all manner of things that I you know should have been learning how to draw years ago.	CHITCHAT
That I missed out on.	CHITCHAT
Because I was being stubborn.	CHITCHAT
And I was super stubborn.	CHITCHAT
I have friends that I went to high school with.	CHITCHAT
That Basically, only dealt with me because they because they knew that I I knew how to draw I was.	CHITCHAT
I was semi popular, wasn't super popular but I had popular brothers, you know, but all my friends were nerds and like in high school.	CHITCHAT
When I went to high school in the years that I went to high school nerds an popular people didn't necessarily makes because of the stigma that went along with being popular versus like nowadays.	CHITCHAT
The entire the entire dynamic has changed, but I'm a lot older, you know.	CHITCHAT
But art wasn't really art.	CHITCHAT
Wasn't really something that was considered something that popular kids did, and when I was younger you could get beat up for something like that.	CHITCHAT
You know, doing anything that wasn't.	CHITCHAT
What they, what people thought you should do, or being a nerd was like a target to put a target on your back for people to pick on you.	CHITCHAT
It was like it was like.	CHITCHAT
People didn't like for you to be too smart, and please don't be the person that would tell the teacher they forgot homework.	CHITCHAT
Stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's a lot of people that would do things like that where it would be like.	CHITCHAT
Where do I even begin?	CHITCHAT
Where?	CHITCHAT
You always had that one guy.	CHITCHAT
Or girl in the classroom.	CHITCHAT
That cared more about being the teachers pet then ultimately being chased home at the end of the day, you know, because you told the teacher that.	CHITCHAT
You know, hey teacher, you forgot to assign homework because that kid is more so concerned about impressing that teacher where everybody else is just trying to have fun.	CHITCHAT

Like in high school you.	CHITCHAT
I tried to explain to my children like.	CHITCHAT
They do this you there's a.	CHITCHAT
There's a thing you have to understand and is very important in art.	CHITCHAT
OK, which is why I'm even discussing this.	CHITCHAT
There is a known fact that anybody.	CHITCHAT
Anybody that goes to school?	CHITCHAT
That hasn't realized this obviously hasn't been paying attention, but everybody should graduate high school.	CHITCHAT
Because they give you all the answers.	CHITCHAT
No one ever really thinks about that because they're too busy doing well, whatever it is that they've been.	CHITCHAT
Like taught.	CHITCHAT
Subconsciously.	CHITCHAT
Overtime, you know.	CHITCHAT
Go to school, you know, hang out with your friends, you know, and then do the boring stuff like work you know.	CHITCHAT
But if the smart people realize up front that well, I mean all I'm basically doing is developing my memory.	CHITCHAT
In Highschool Elementary School Junior High School.	CHITCHAT
They're giving you all the answers and then they give you a test.	CHITCHAT
You're basically remembering.	CHITCHAT
Is the same thing with art.	CHITCHAT
Is when you're learning art, you're being given all the answers you know.	CHITCHAT
You just have to be able to attain that knowledge and do something with it.	CHITCHAT
You know you're training yourself your entire life to increase your memory so that you can store all of this knowledge so that you can ultimately recall it when you need to do something different and utilized it in a different way, you know.	CHITCHAT
If if you remember being a high school, you will remember that a lot of people.	CHITCHAT
When I see a lot of people, I mean, a lot of people just getting.	CHITCHAT
Care about doing it, what they were supposed to do in high school.	CHITCHAT
They were basically John to go out and hang out with their friends and wait for lunch time and you know it was.	CHITCHAT
It was all about fun.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
The people that changed the world and the people that do the most.	CHITCHAT
They will sacrifice fun for a later date or all together to accomplish a goal.	CHITCHAT
That doesn't mean you have to do that in art, you know.	CHITCHAT
Hey Steven, how are you good morning if you have any questions feel free to ask.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't mean you have to do that in art, you know, but.	CHITCHAT
You have to find a healthy balance.	CHITCHAT
You have to find a balance of boring stuff.	CHITCHAT
And fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
Now if you find if you find the ability to make the boring stuff fun, art will open up, and in the universe will be yours.	CHITCHAT
You know the boring stuff, meaning practice or things that don't get you attention or whatever you're seeking, or whatever.	CHITCHAT
Me, my, my goal has never been after a certain point.	CHITCHAT
Once I got over my ego, my my goal was to never be famous or any of that kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
I don't care about fame.	CHITCHAT
I don't care about being known and the reason why is because I want people to focus more on my art and less on the person that does it, you know.	CHITCHAT
Plus, I learned very early on that fame comes with a hefty price.	CHITCHAT
And if it doesn't have anything to do with art	CHITCHAT
I don't want to be bothered with it, you know?	CHITCHAT
I also learned that I went through a lot of really tough stuff in art that a lot of people could potentially go through, and I want to save as many people as I can from going through as much pain.	CHITCHAT
You're gonna go through pain.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to be able to stop people from going through pain in art.	CHITCHAT
My goal is to minimize the amount of pain you know ASL W.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
Welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
To the channel.	CHITCHAT
What we basically do around here or what I basically do around here is I practice and I turn practice into these lovely things called test.	O
She's you know.	CHITCHAT
And basically what I'm practicing on is is honing my my my style in my skill set overall to increase the value of what I do not to sell it.	O
But to get people to listen.	CHITCHAT
Because if you can get people to listen, then ultimately you can change the structure and the current state of art and hopefully.	O
Get people to open their eyes and start and start being more.	O
Are always takes the shift.	CHITCHAT
And it all it has.	CHITCHAT
There has to be something to make that shift happen and every little bit that you do in art.	CHITCHAT

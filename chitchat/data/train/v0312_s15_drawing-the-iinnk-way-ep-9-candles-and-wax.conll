Helps with that.	CHITCHAT
You know, I want people to grow their mind and do lots of creative stuff and and get more people to actually stay in our instead of thinking.	O
Oh well, this isn't going to pay the Bills and I need to get a real job.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to get people to focus on the fact that art is not about the money.	CHITCHAT
It's nice if you make money from art, but ultimately you want to express yourself in art is a great way to express yourself and trying to get and I'm basically trying to get people to pick up their pencils and raw because if I can get them to pick up their pencils and draw eventually.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully.	CHITCHAT
Eventually they'll understand later on that that is how you get better.	CHITCHAT
At the end of the day, that will be how you determine.	CHITCHAT
How your journey will go.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
But you don't necessarily know that.	CHITCHAT
If you don't ever get that far, So what I try to do is get people to understand is that if you don't give up and you keep doing what you're supposed to be doing, you will eventually.	CHITCHAT
Understand that.	CHITCHAT
You can do anything.	CHITCHAT
In art.	CHITCHAT
If you consistently practice and you consistently focus on the fun aspect of it, you know.	CHITCHAT
Rather than doing boring mundane.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't know cookie cutter, so that's a cookie cutter.	CHITCHAT
Like methods of drawing and stuff like that, you know.	CHITCHAT
No one ever really tells you this, but I'm going to tell you.	CHITCHAT
Because I want you to understand.	CHITCHAT
The journey of learning art.	CHITCHAT
Will be greatly overlooked by you.	CHITCHAT
But will be ultimately remembered as some of the greatest times in your life.	CHITCHAT
And you will ask yourself, well why?	CHITCHAT
Because right now, if you're learning.	CHITCHAT
And you're not paying attention to it.	CHITCHAT
You don't realize that.	CHITCHAT
These times are fleeting.	CHITCHAT
And once you get to the point where you actually start making money from your art, you no longer have time.	CHITCHAT
For your own journey, will you have very little time for your own journey, meaning you won't be drawing very many things for yourself.	CHITCHAT
You won't be drawing very many things.	CHITCHAT
You know that.	CHITCHAT
Will make you feel warm and squishy inside and things as you can post on the Internet and stuff like that when you actually start making money from yard.	CHITCHAT
If you're pursuing money you will learn later on that you're drawing for other people.	CHITCHAT
So if your dry for other people.	CHITCHAT
You don't draw what you want.	CHITCHAT
No one like in most professions no one wants people want your skill set.	CHITCHAT
They don't want to see.	CHITCHAT
They don't want to see you do what you do and then pay you for it.	CHITCHAT
Which is what most people think when they getting tired.	CHITCHAT
I want to draw.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to draw this and I'm gonna give you to pay me for it.	CHITCHAT
You can do it.	CHITCHAT
But first you have to establish that you can actually do art and that you can actually do things you know.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
You start gathering customers.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause a lot of people think.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm going to make prints.	CHITCHAT
You can make friends, right?	CHITCHAT
But You're also going to have to take commissions.	CHITCHAT
Commissioners make more than Prince unox is going to come in and make friends and make it make a crap ton of money.	CHITCHAT
You know, can it be done?	CHITCHAT
Of course anything can be done.	CHITCHAT
But realistically, coming in with that mind state could be more hurtful than helpful.	CHITCHAT
You know you.	CHITCHAT
Have to enjoy the time you have because once you start working it is no longer about you.	CHITCHAT
It is about the people that are going to pay you or is going to be about you making a living, which ultimately is to get people is going to end up being getting people to buy what you're trying to sale, you know, and even if you don't work for somebody and you work for yourself in order to get people to want to buy what you sell, you have to be able to do things that people like.	CHITCHAT
I cannot just sit up here and draw whatever I want and say, Hey, you need to buy it.	CHITCHAT
I mean I can, but no one's going to do it is going to look at you like I'm not buying that.	CHITCHAT
I don't want that thing you did you, did you know it's the same thing?	CHITCHAT
It's actually, I gotta tattooing and I told myself I'm not going to draw fairies.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to draw butterflies.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to draw roses.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to do all of these things because they're all dumb and I don't want to do it.	CHITCHAT
and I don't want to be that.	CHITCHAT
Tattoo artist and I'm better than this, you know?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It was it was.	CHITCHAT
It was great.	CHITCHAT

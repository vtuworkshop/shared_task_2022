Feeling that way when I first started thinking I'm going to be the different tattoo artist and I'm going to be dominant.	CHITCHAT
Do the things that matter.	CHITCHAT
This is kind of how my brain was working is like I'm going to do things that matter.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to do what other people do.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do the real stuff well.	CHITCHAT
You know 19 years later.	CHITCHAT
Here I am.	CHITCHAT
And this is what I'm basically doing.	CHITCHAT
Today At about 11:00 o'clock PM or AM Pacific Standard Time.	CHITCHAT
This is of all the artwork that I can do in stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
This is ultimately what pays my bills.	CHITCHAT
This is ultimately what it allows me to do.	CHITCHAT
All the things that I do.	CHITCHAT
This is, ultimately, ultimately what allows me to sit up and complain about not wanting to do things that I don't want to do.	CHITCHAT
This is the reality, but because I'm because I matured as an artist and I have grown a lot, I understand that because I do this kind of stuff, even though I don't, I didn't ever want to do it in the 1st place.	CHITCHAT
Didn't mean I couldn't do it my own way.	CHITCHAT
And that's the game changer for the longest time when people would bring me stuff I would just do what they told me to do.	CHITCHAT
And you know all of that.	CHITCHAT
If someone comes to you and they tell you they want a tattoo, which this particular person came to me in there, like I want a half sleeve, they gave me all of these.	O
Different Flowers are tulips.	O
Daisies Lotus Flower arose.	CHITCHAT
Cherry blossoms at a giant.	CHITCHAT
Sunflower with a little lady bug on it.	CHITCHAT
I said that's not going to be for 1/2 sleeve.	O
That's too much stuff.	O
To fit in a half sleeve, you know, yes, I can make it fit in a half sleeve, but it won't look good.	O
It will be way it will be way more artistic.	O
If I actually made it fit the full sleeve, you don't necessarily have to get it all done at once.	O
You get the bottom half done and then you can get the rest done later and it will have a lot more meaning and significance.	O
I fact that up with a drawing which you see here to show her what I meant now granted this is going to be a full arms Lee looking at this.	O
Like this you would think.	O
That looks kind of playing.	O
Imagine is being wrapped around someone's arm, fully colored.	O
Now, what we ultimately decided to do, or what I ultimately decided to do, which I have to actually convince her to do, but if not.	O
No biggie is to make everything black and grey except the butterflies.	O
Because that would be more artistic and it will ultimately pop out more.	O
It'll make the butterfly stand out more, you know, but it will also make her arm feel bored uniform.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
If she says no one, she goes with color.	O
It's going to be even better.	O
Sister butterflies will pop.	O
It'll take longer to probably be a lot more pain, but at the end of the day, you know.	O
But there was a time where I was like, I'm not.	O
I am not drawing this.	O
This is what I am not doing.	O
I don't like drawing stuff like this.	O
But this is what pays my bills because I'm good at drawing an Hulu.	O
I will be good at doing Flowers and butterflies and all of the things that I said.	O
I hate it.	CHITCHAT
Because.	O
Knowing how to draw everything.	O
May actually set you apart from those people that can't do it or do it very poorly, uhm?	O
Every artist wants to do things like this.	O
Every tattoo artist that I know of.	O
Wanted to do things like this.	O
You know which are a huge body suits?	O
You know a lot of them can't.	O
Draw stuff like this, but they want to do stuff like this because this kind of stuff gets you into magazines.	O
It's a different feeling when you can draw it and make it fit the body and you take into consideration things that are culturally related and that actually ultimately go together and you know all that good stuff.	O
You don't necessarily get a lot of that, but it all starts here.	O
Starts with something as simple as drawing candles and you're like how to candles.	O
Have to relate to draw and Dragons.	O
It's not so much about the candles, it's about the understanding of drawing pretty much anything you know you practice will make you better.	O
Everything relates to something you know, add.	O
Me practicing drawing candles now and getting my style to fit what I'm drawing.	O
And then someone comes to me.	CHITCHAT
And they asked me.	CHITCHAT
OK, I want you to date that they come to me and they say hey, I want you to draw me something for a tattoo and I'm like OK what do you want and they start explaining to me what they want and I take their idea and I do it in a way that I that I think would work best while while obviously getting what they want.

Also.	CHITCHAT
What ends up happening?	CHITCHAT
Is now you become known for your range in skill?	CHITCHAT
If that makes any, if that makes sense, your skill set being able to take someone's idea.	CHITCHAT
And turn it into something better than they actually imagined.	CHITCHAT
Which is the part that a lot of people can't do.	CHITCHAT
They a lot of people can't.	CHITCHAT
A lot of tattoo artist don't have the range of practice.	O
To take a person's idea.	O
And then sit down and rearrange it in such a way that it blows their mind.	O
Because remember and an artist.	O
In their head they know what it's gonna look like, but they don't necessarily know if it'll fit.	O
The weight is going to fit.	O
They came to you because they trusted you with their vision.	O
Your job is to take their vision and completely turn it on his head and bring them back, something that is going to blow their mind.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
That is literally going to make them like.	O
Like just drop their jaw in awe, like Holy Moly, I knew.	O
That this idea could be good, but man, I didn't think that it could be this good.	O
You are great at what you do and blah blah blah, you know.	O
And when you get clients like that, they will be lifetime clients.	O
You know, but a lot of people just like a lot of people miss that opportunity 'cause they're just like, Oh my God, you know, like meow cigar or another fairy.	O
I don't.	CHITCHAT
Stupid ferries.	O
I hate doing this kind of stuff, you know, like let other people do it.	O
And you know, I just want to do super cool, you know.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Ridiculously awesome graffiti work which not that many people keep graffiti tattooed people do it, but it's not.	O
I don't know what I was thinking about with that.	O
I don't know why I thought that I was going to be like the the world's best graffiti tattoo artists or I started being very abstract.	O
You know, with my art and abstract artist, cool, but you you have to appeal to the people that come to you as well as the stuff you want to do.	O
You know you will understand later that there is a balance.	O
Understanding that balance will greatly increase your revenue.	O
And that balances.	O
There are people that are around you that one specific things at the same time you have to seek out the people that want the things you want to do.	O
Meaning when you're at work, you're working.	O
Do what you do, what you have to do at your work.	O
After you're done working, you do what you want to do.	O
You know, so like right now I'm practicing candles.	O
I have no idea what I'm going to be doing with candles, but I know that when I do have to do something with candles I will be more trained at drawing handles.	O
You know, and I won't necessarily have to think, as much as I used too about drawing candles, because ultimately, I've been putting a lot of practice into my candle drawing and you know, people people will see these tests, and they may actually get better at drawing candles and everything completely works out, you know.	O
And then when I do my candle tattoo, I won't feel like not another candle because I'm actually drawing what I trained myself to do the way that.	O
I like to do it even though my goal is my goal.	O
Ultimate goal wasn't to be drawing candles.	O
You know if I'm going to be paid.	O
To do it.	CHITCHAT
I might as well like what I'm doing, you know?	O
That means that makes win.	O
That makes it so when you do things that you actually like to do, you like them even more, you know or you appreciate them even more.	O
You know, a lot of people don't look at it like that.	O
There's a lot of people that don't that cannot understand.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
He since you've essential value.	O
Of pleasing your client, you know your idea.	O
You know that you have to please.	O
Your clients get paid right?	O
But in most most artists mindstate it's I'm going to please my client with what I want to do because they want to see what I want to do and that's why they came to me.	O

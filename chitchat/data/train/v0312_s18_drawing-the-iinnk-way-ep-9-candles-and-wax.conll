They most clients come to you because they because they heard you were good.	O
You know they don't did a lot of really don't know your skill set and even if they do know your skill set there, taking your skill set to complete their vision, it has nothing to do with you.	O
You know a lot of a lot of people, especially in tattoo, and when they come to you in tattooing, they don't even know if you can do what they do.	O
They just know you're a tattoo.	O
Artists and their friend recommended you and they need to have to work done.	O
Can you do it?	CHITCHAT
You know, and if you say yes, they're going to be like, OK, well, I want this portrait done and you're like I don't want to do portraits.	O
You know I do portraits, but I try to refrain from doing it, but.	O
They'll be like well.	O
You tattoo right and it's like, yeah, it's like well I want to sports are done.	O
It's like yeah, I don't do portraits and the minute you say you don't do portraits, they're gonna be like bad tattoo artist.	O
Every tattoo artist should be able to do portraits.	O
I've seen that on Miami and it should take you only an hour, you know.	O
And because it's super small and I wanted on my knuckle it should be cheaper because for some reason people relate small an art to less expensive.	O
You know, and that is the exact opposite.	O
If you're doing something of high quality or high caliber high every however you want to look at it.	O
That's small, it makes it harder.	O
It makes it way harder to do.	O
And a lot of people can't get behind that.	O
Which generally ends up making it, making it a lot more difficult than you would probably think to do.	O
The things that you want to do.	O
In tattooing so you start like me I practice everyday.	O
Because the more and more I practiced in, the more things that I practiced, the more tattoos that I could make doing.	O
The things that I practice.	O
You know, if I get really, really good at tattooing.	O
Candles and I could do all kinds of things with candles and a lot of people will be like well, what?	O
What will be?	CHITCHAT
What will be the significance of me learning how to draw candles OK?	O
This particular drawing.	O
Of me drawing handles is cool, so whatever you know, it's you know candles.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
The drawing this like.	O
Onestream might actually help somebody's rock handle a candle.	O
Abra or candles.	O
You know when they're doing like.	O
A nice Dracula piece or something like that for the sake of just drawing.	O
You know, not not to make money or anything like that just for the sake of drawing.	O
They're doing a nice dracul peace and they need it like candles in the background.	O
Has helped him to learn how to draw candles.	O
Oh, it's really.	CHITCHAT
I'm not making any money from that right?	CHITCHAT
Because I don't sell artwork.	CHITCHAT
I just give it away, you know?	CHITCHAT
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
And people will be like, well, how do you sustain your living, OK?	O
This is where the cool part comes in.	O
Because these few running the meal regular, whatever concept candles.	O
Could be.	O
Done like this.	O
Now this is where the money comes in.	O
Same concept.	CHITCHAT
Except for these candles are attached to this image, which ultimately will go on someones body right?	O
And that body?	CHITCHAT
Attach that person will pay me.	O
That person is going to pay me hundreds of dollars an hour to put this image on their body simply because of the way that everything that's involved.	O
Now the client is going to be looking at the face in the in the skull and all that I have to actually finish this girls face 'cause it?	O
I really just kind of phones in the Bank of just wanted the idea to, but the Reaper and the girl holding the size is pretty much where everybody else is going to be focusing.	O
Now what I what I'm focused on.	O
Is the candles and the use of the smoke as filigree because in tattooing filigree is a very, very, very huge thing.	O
You know, and what is filigree filigree is basically the outline of the tattoo or the background of the tattoo, or anything that in frames which you want people to see and you want to make pop out.	O
Meaning like if if you pay very close attention, this candles down here.	O
The candles can literally be overlooked because they're just candles, but if you look at the smoke, the smoke will basically in frame the face.	O

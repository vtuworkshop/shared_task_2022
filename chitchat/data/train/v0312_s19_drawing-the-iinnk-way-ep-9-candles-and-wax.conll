Leading all the way up to the top where the smoke just like you know.	O
Skulls in the smoke and stuff like that.	O
Something very, very insignificant that will make a very huge impact on this piece.	O
In general.	CHITCHAT
And that's why learning how to draw in enemy stuff or unimportant stuff becomes important later.	O
You know, because the things that you don't necessarily look at.	O
Of course, the focal point is the girl and the Reaper, but everything in this piece ties into this focal point.	O
There are three different phases are three different levels to Tatooine.	O
There is the foreground or the focal point where everybody is supposed to look first.	O
It's what you want people to draw their eyes too.	O
It's generally the concept that idea.	O
You know two is background.	O
Background is, well, it's exactly what it says.	O
Background.	CHITCHAT
It's the back of the artwork.	O
Whatever is behind it that you are going to.	O
You know, try to try to use the push the foreground forward, or you know all that good stuff.	O
That's generally what the background is for is to make whatever is in front.	O
No kind of pop out or to make it look 3D or Whatnot then ultimately you have the the filigree.	O
Filigree is so that you didn't look like you just drew on someone skin that, like you were drawing on a piece of paper.	O
Filigree makes that artistic and makes it feel more like it was made for their body and not made on a piece of paper and stuck on their body.	O
The.	O
Professional or trained.	O
Usage of filigree.	O
Will determine whether or not you are considered to be at a higher caliber in tattooing.	O
Believe it or not, the use of filigree no matter what it is 'cause filigree can be any any form of media is literally just whatever's in the background that makes the foreground look better, you know, or whatever is in cat.	O
In casing the art.	O
In a sense, so let me see if I can pull up a better example.	O
So you have.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
What would be a good example?	CHITCHAT
So many different things.	CHITCHAT
What about this?	CHITCHAT
And not really.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
See, this will be dis appra bubley be a good example.	O
So you have.	CHITCHAT
This is the story of Persephone.	O
This is a tattoo idea that I did that I'm going to redraw every concept because I made it too.	O
I feel like I made it just simple.	O
Wanted to pop out more.	O
The only problem is if I do this the way I want to do it, it will no longer fit the body part I wanted to fit on and.	O
That makes it increasingly hard.	O
Or it's a tattoo so.	O
The focal point, of course, is Persephone, her mother demeanor, and the Devil, you know, lose for the background being like whatever is behind them, like the fire.	O
You know, like the birds, the leaves and stuff like that, and then the filigree is the vines and all the decorations.	O
That kind of go around it too, in case the entire peace and draw your eye and carry the image.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
Well, I was concepting this piece.	O
I had no idea how I was going to.	O
In cases piece or foreground, or may not offer or use, use a filigree.	O
Already the background the background was going to be whatever was behind them to kind of make it not look like they were just stuck there.	O
So like with with the Persephone.	O
For Stephanie Would basically like have birds 'cause she was like you know nature and like leaves and stuff like that.	O
Of course the devil being the Devil, you have to have some kind of fire or something like that.	O
You know Lucifer.	O
You know, and then of course, demeanor being the the God of the seasons.	O

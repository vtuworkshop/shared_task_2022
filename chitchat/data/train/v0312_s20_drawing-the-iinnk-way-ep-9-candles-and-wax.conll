Basically, that's where the fruit in the harvest in the leaves and stuff come from.	O
Now I would I would dig deeper into that when I draw it better and more in depth.	O
This was literally a quick study.	O
But how do you in case something like that?	O
Because like up here, I'm probably going to have fire coming off the sides of the left side to counter the right.	O
You know, of course, the other two you have, like vines and things like that, but I couldn't figure out.	O
Anything else, and then I started thinking like what kind of designs would they have used in Greek mythology and stuff like that, you know.	O
And I've seen like a couple of the optimal a couple vods up.	O
My God vases are vases or whatever that had like little designs and stuff like that.	O
So I kind of stole the designs off of them and then just kind of use them as like the parts to encase each area of the design.	O
Now when I go back more into detail these little little.	O
Patterns and things like that will probably be taken.	O
And reused differently.	O
But that's kind of what I go for what I do my when I do my drawings and stuff like that.	O
It's the same thing.	O
With this is like OK, I have the I have the focal point.	O
What is the setting that this focal point is in?	O
So this is the grim Reaper and the goddess of death or whatever and what would be cool to add to their you know.	O
I don't know where they were there.	O
This whole entire thing is taking place.	O
I'm assuming it would probably be like in the underworld or somewhere dark, so the background will be like kind of dark in Erie or whatever.	O
And then of course you would have the candles to light the front of them and I will make the whole entire image kind of based on that light source.	O
With That being said, You know you throw the schools down for good measure 'cause This is going to be allowed.	O
A body.	O
And the thing that the dignity of the understanding was drawing on the body is that you can't just stop and image.	O
It has to have a beginning and an end, so I just threw some skulls at the bottom for good measure and then you know.	O
And also I could have the.	O
The candles dripping on the skulls.	O
You know 'cause more artistic now granite.	O
Once I get a lot more seasoned at at designing tattoos and stuff like that, I will.	O
I will completely do think of a different like.	O
My brain would be more expanded to think of more cool things to make this piece of feel a lot more cool, or a piece like this feel a lot more cooler, you know, but my whole entire purpose for drawing this piece was so I could draw smoke coming off of candles because people have not.	O
A lot of people don't realize how artistic you can be with smoke.	O
A special candle smoke because if you ever look at candle smoke when the candle burns out and the smoke is just going, it does.	O
It literally looks like it's dancing in the Wind.	O
It is so cool and you can do a lot with that if you understand how to draw it and you understand how to get it.	O
You know the way that you want it and you can.	O
You can high imagery in the smoke, you know little things like that when it comes to designing.	O
Tattoos will be a very very big asset.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Which is why I decided to practice candles.	O
I needed a techy for candles.	O
I have promised a lot of people would do one I said I would do inanimate objects.	O
Candles just happened to be the inanimate object that I chose because I know I.	O
I want to I want to at least draw one tattoo.	O
You know that scandal based?	O
Meaning the entire focus is.	O
Of the candle or what I want to do is like taking the image and make whatever the images.	O
Like a candle in it melting.	O
You know, whatever, whatever it may be.	O
I want that to be the.	O
The tattoo idea or concept or what not?	O
Is why you do boring mundane stuff like This is why this kind of stuff is so important.	O
What I'm basically doing right now because it doesn't take very much, you know, to learn how to draw candle like you.	O
If you know how to draw one, you can draw any of the red lines in the image of here.	O
It.	CHITCHAT
They represent the most basic shapes that I could come up with to help myself remember how to do.	O
Things like.	O
You know this, you know it's just a cylinder or whatever, but most candles are sailing.	O
There's now when you get when you get past the basics of drawing that specific type of thing you can, you can venture deeper.	O

And start doing different things and more experimental stuff.	O
But what I want to do more so is get used to drawing flames.	O
Used to drawing smoke.	O
Used to drawing candle wax, melting and then putting them altogether.	O
To make.	O
Designs.	O
You know that may eventually become tattoos or anything like that.	O
I also want to.	O
Sorry this early in the morning for me.	O
Um, I ultimately want to.	O
Make designs and stuff like that.	O
So like I kind of want to do tattoos of these is kind of where I'm going with this, but I don't necessarily want to do just tattoos of candles.	O
I want to do something that.	O
I haven't seen before, and a tattoo which is the problem is it's really hard to find things that you haven't seen before in anything real like like imagine doing like a candle, right?	O
And then my having the wax be something right and then having the flame be something else is something that I'm thinking about my head so you know you have like the candle.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But the candle is something like I don't know.	O
A bird.	O
Dying like the bottom part of the camp, this will be all like the image right here.	O
You know the bird like like say you have like a bird like dying or whatever like laying down and you know their wings and.	O
All of that is very rough.	O
Don't judge me.	O
And dying, and it's a candle.	O
And then have the flame being like a Phoenix.	O
Like As boring and ridiculous as that might sound that idea.	O
Could be something that is definitely definitely like groundbreaking in tattooing and will will will usher in a series of that kind of tattoo.	O
You know meaning people will.	O
People will see it.	O
And they will think, holy crap.	O
I should probably do something similar.	O
You know I've seen this guy do this work and I think it's awesome.	O
Or Have you ever seen anybody draw flames, right?	O
They draw flames.	O
So you have like a matchstick, right?	O
And then you have the flame.	O
But in the inside the flame you have, like a silhouette, so you have like.	O
Something like this?	O
Which a lot of people don't necessarily.	O
Do a lot more, but like you have like.	O
You know a female.	O
And then you have a guy.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Kissing or whatever you wanted to be doing, you know?	O
In the flame.	O
To represent like love or a mother holding a baby which you could silhouette that or think about you know all of that kind of stuff in the in the.	O
Silhouette Of the candle.	O
Or a silhouette of the flame coming from the candle, which could be the shape of a heart.	O
Or something like that.	O
Just just think of the possibilities you know or tell a story you know have.	O
The heart.	O
And then have the flame with the two people in it and then have the smoke.	O
Alt like being a baby, being born or something like that.	O
You know it again as art as regular drawings and stuff like that.	O
A lot of that stuff could really be like pointless.	O
You know my address is not just not that great, you know, but in a different medium like tattooing, that could be very, very meaningful.	O
You know it could really be.	O
It could be very meaningful to someone and then 'cause tattooing is all about.	O
It's all about expression and getting your ideas and getting your feelings on as a as a piece of art that will be on your body forever.	O
Your beliefs or Whatnot.	O
You know people will get like their mantra and a lot of people will get like you know there.	O

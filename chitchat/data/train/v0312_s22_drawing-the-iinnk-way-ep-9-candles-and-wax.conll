Words to live by and then words of encouragement and things like that.	O
A lot of people do a lot of different things in tattooing for a lot of different reasons.	O
But again, your ability to use their ideas.	O
To make something cool.	O
Will.	O
Show your range as far as like art creation is concerned.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
You know, again, if I?	CHITCHAT
Oh well, anybody can draw candles, not that big of a deal it scandal, you know, but your ability to.	O
Bend the rules.	O
To something that would be awesome see I would probably do something like.	O
I would have this here and then.	O
I would probably.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's make it bigger.	O
So you know, we've already established that there be two people.	O
I would probably make the the the silhouette VA lot more detailed where it would be 2 full body people embraced two cameras, I mean 2 candles, themes or whatever.	O
And then the candle will be sitting.	O
On the little candle, abra or whatever but.	O
In a tray on a table and then I probably have like a rose or something.	O
In front of it.	O
Just kind of like laying on the table in the candy.	O
The roles would be like here and then.	O
This would be like the candle abra or whatever you know.	O
Like like there's a rolls next to a candle on a table.	O
Is usually a very romantic setting, you know, and then have two people kissing in the you know like believe it or not, that would sell very good as a tattoo.	O
Where most people will draw that and start drawing and be like this is dumb.	O
No one is going to buy this stop and then go and do something else.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Go back to drawing.	O
Animatics or whatever it is that you think people want when you don't realize that there's somebody out there that would totally jump on the ability to be able to get an idea like this, and then they would really be like holy crap, no windows stuff like this, you know.	O
Or you could draw.	O
This same concept, same candle or whatever but.	O
In the candle.	O
You can add.	O
Something like a picture.	O
Make that make the picture look like.	O
Or make the make the.	O
The whatever you draw look like it's embedded in the side of the candle.	O
With all the.	CHITCHAT
With all the candle wax and all that tripping over it so you have candlelight driven over in it right here, it'll be like.	O
You know love and forever or I don't know anything you could possibly think of, like the possibly like this thing is like the possibilities are endless and if you really want to get artistic, throw like some butterflies up here.	O
Getting ready to be staged by the flames and dude you could just go so many places with it and people will automatically think like no one is going to buy this as a tattoo.	O
No one wants to get that as a tattoo.	O
You would be surprised.	O
Because of the level, simply because of the level of the symbolism, is it in it?	O
People would go crazy.	O
Or you could even do that.	O
Take the smoke.	O
Make a heart out of the smoke so like OK it's like this.	O
Back it up.	O
Because you know, again, we're making a.	O
We're making AO tribute to love or whatever for this piece or whatever you know like so you're looking at this and you thinking like.	O
These two people are in love in this task.	O
He was going to signify that love and that bond.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
When creating a.	O
New piece.	O
I'm thinking like OK?	CHITCHAT
You got the two people.	O
That are going to be silhouetted inside of here, which you know.	O
These would be more detailed, obviously.	O
You know, and they will be hugging each other.	O
It'll be 2 candle Wicks joining together again symbolism so you have.	O
These two candle was joined together and then like the flame and then up here you will have.	O

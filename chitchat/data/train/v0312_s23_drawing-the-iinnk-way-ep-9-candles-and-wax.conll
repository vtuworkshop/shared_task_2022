This smoke.	O
In the shape of a heart.	O
You know and.	O
This is where learning how to draw smokin, making smoke, dance and all of that stuff comes into play because again.	O
The average person is not going to think about this.	O
You know the average person isn't going to come in and be like Oh my God, I have this idea.	O
You know, they know they want something to signify their their them in their partners love, but they don't know what you know, but they've been with this person for 9 weeks and they know it's it's the realist.	O
In this is the thing that they you know they've been looking for their whole life and they want to symbolize it.	O
With something so.	O
You know, can you help them figure out what they're going to get, you know?	O
Where is my death candles?	O
Yeah, the other thing you gotta like.	O
Cancel.	CHITCHAT
I have it very.	CHITCHAT
Like Like with this I did a lot of study on candles and.	O
Figuring out ways to make it not look so boring.	O
Which is another reason why you make test sheets and you make references and stuff like that 'cause you forget a lot of that.	O
And that makes it.	O
It makes it harder for you to make.	O
Things like smoke.	O
To be balanced and.	O
All of that so.	CHITCHAT
Again, you're taking the smoke and you're making it look real artistic.	O
So what I'm trying to do is to make it look like it's flowing.	O
Of course, like smoke and not like fire because smoking fire can be easily misconstrued in tattooing because they're drawn similar.	O
If you draw like that, 'cause mean everybody has their own different style, but for me it could be misconstrued because I draw them similar except for the difference is the fire.	O
Is sharp and pointy where the smoke?	O
Is a lot more loose.	O
So you have like the smoke move and probably have a dance around in such a way.	O
You know where it will?	O
Be able to.	CHITCHAT
You know, of course this is going to be colored, so the flame will be yellowish red or whatnot, and.	O
The smoke will be Gray, you know, and then of course at the bottom.	O
You know, once you're done messing around with the candle and.	O
All that and making the candle look neat.	O
You can put.	CHITCHAT
Like like I said, I could put.	O
You could put like a like I would put like A.	O
A base.	O
Like a tray or something like that.	O
And then next to the tray.	O
I would have like a rose coming down right, like right next to it like a rose, like on the tray.	O
Right next to it.	O
So that it would look like, Well, you know this candle is telling a story of two lovers are two people in love, you know?	O
And depending on how in depth you want to go with that story or that whole entire concept, you can do all kinds of like symbolic stuff you know based off of candle.	O
But when we were creating, we usually well at least me.	O
I usually forget.	O
A lot of stuff that I would normally you know like refer to when it's when it's time to create.	O
Stuff using specific media.	O
I'm always like man.	O
I don't necessarily know how to stress this creatively to be better.	O
So I will reference old stuff that I've done.	O
To pull from that.	O
Something new.	O
And the purpose of this test sheet or the purpose of this test, she will be too.	O

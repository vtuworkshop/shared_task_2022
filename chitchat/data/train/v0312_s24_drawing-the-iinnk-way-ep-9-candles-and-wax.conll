Basically, emphasize how to use fire.	O
Smoke and the candle itself to make decorative.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Art stuff.	CHITCHAT
And of course, if you guys have any questions about Arctic tattoo and feel free to ask.	CHITCHAT
I am.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much.	CHITCHAT
Done with my studies for today.	CHITCHAT
Well, I mean for this particular time I'll be back on later.	CHITCHAT
To work more on drawing candles.	O
And finish this, test it off.	CHITCHAT
It was early.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to draw.	CHITCHAT
So I got up and I drew 'cause I was early.	CHITCHAT
I will.	CHITCHAT
Be going back to bed and then I will be getting up in my regular time so I will more than likely be drawing this tomorrow or later on today, probably in the afternoon.	CHITCHAT
My time.	CHITCHAT
So like around you know three o'clock four o'clock my time.	CHITCHAT
If you haven't followed the channel, make sure you follow will be finishing this off and then of course if you haven't followed my discord.	CHITCHAT
Once this is done, I'm going to put it in my discord.	CHITCHAT
I do not sell art on my channel.	CHITCHAT
I give it away because entire purpose is to help you learn.	CHITCHAT
It's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not about you sitting here watching me and seeing me to art.	CHITCHAT
It's about me motivating you to want to try it yourself.	CHITCHAT
An ultimately, when the tests are done, I post them where you can get them.	CHITCHAT
So like these kinds of things, I have like hundreds of 'em in my discord.	CHITCHAT
Just go into the room labeled test sheets.	CHITCHAT
Once you join discord and you can download, download them and do whatever you please.	CHITCHAT
I also.	CHITCHAT
You know, take requests in my discord for things you want me to draw things you might want to see me work on things like that.	CHITCHAT
You can pretty much request whatever you want.	CHITCHAT
I usually just go in there when I have nothing to do and I pick pick something from what you guys want and I draw it and I try to.	CHITCHAT
I try to teach myself and then I try to turn it into something that could ultimately help other people.	CHITCHAT
Want to become better at doing things?	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
I also have a page on any nicely put the link up for the Patris on, but if you want to take out the pizza Rita Patris on the page on is basically called 1000 true fans I will put a link in the chat in just a second.	CHITCHAT
But the whole entire goal of the Patris on is to show.	CHITCHAT
How good of?	CHITCHAT
How do I say it?	CHITCHAT
How?	CHITCHAT
Much better production value could be.	CHITCHAT
If.	CHITCHAT
I had the funding to do so.	CHITCHAT
It literally only costs a dollar to join my Patriot.	CHITCHAT
Pogo, let's see if I can get 1000 people to donate a dollar for one year to be ultimately like $12.00 to show.	CHITCHAT
To see just how much better this show could be the production value and stuff like that are, you know, like YouTube videos, stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm also in the process of learning how to video edit so I could actually do better jobs editing, which would ultimately make me get more to the point when I draw.	CHITCHAT
You know, instead of like a lot of times what I do is I Ramble.	CHITCHAT
You know, and it would help me.	CHITCHAT
It was definitely going to help me cut down on the ram.	CHITCHAT
Lee, you know, I rent a lot to the Ritz.	CHITCHAT
I want the rest to be more focused, you know.	CHITCHAT
But in any case, check it out if you want.	CHITCHAT
If not it doesn't.	CHITCHAT
You know you don't have to, but I want to put the information out there so you guys know when is there also drawing a book?	CHITCHAT
Which turned out to be a lot more headache even I thought, but when it's done, it's going to be a nice life resumes thing to add.	CHITCHAT
I would love to be able to say I made a book, so I'm going to make a book while I'm making a book and it is going to teach you the why of art and not the How everybody always teaches you how to do stuff.	CHITCHAT
But no one has ever gotten to the part where they teach you why.	CHITCHAT
You know which I try to talk about a lot.	CHITCHAT
When I'm doing my art because that's the thing that's most important to me, is the Y.	CHITCHAT
How is not that big of a deal?	CHITCHAT
You know how how you draw?	CHITCHAT
You know a candle.	CHITCHAT

This is usually what my mornings look like.	CHITCHAT
I open up a fresh you know canvas right here in a fresco on the iPad and I just start start drawing.	CHITCHAT
Kind of just fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm working on feet so what's up?	CHITCHAT
Jack?	CHITCHAT
Jack?	CHITCHAT
Awesome stream by the way, I was checking it out right before I came on here.	CHITCHAT
Love the spaceman.	CHITCHAT
Love all those like millions of lines of code that you decided to bring up.	CHITCHAT
That stuff was super cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna go back and watch 'cause I saw the animations at the end and it looks really super rad so.	CHITCHAT

You know, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Let us know when your stream schedule is.	CHITCHAT
Uhm so yeah.	CHITCHAT
So like I was saying I rough sketch a lot in the morning.	CHITCHAT
I do these fun little doodles.	CHITCHAT
I've started working on feet view that are returning.	CHITCHAT
You know that I struggle with drawing codes so I'm starting to try to like get into it.	CHITCHAT
I keep doing the feet on the wrong side like this weird cross leg in front whatever.	CHITCHAT
Not the point.	CHITCHAT
I want to focus on this little squid with all this ink.	O
Kind of coming out the bottom of it.	O
There's a lot of folks like.	O
If this was a rough sketch, I want to take that next step so tonight that we're going, we're going to take a new canvas or duplicate this project.	O
Going to go back to my home.	CHITCHAT
We're going to so just click fresco.	O
UI pressure Funeral Home page.	O
You can see like upcoming features up in the top part that you can view if you tap, it shows you what's in the update.	O
Also it shows like near most recent projects, we're going to actually go to our cloud documents and we're just going to duplicate this one were just jumping right into it tonight.	O
I should probably talk about the schedule usually so I have four streams that run for a week.	CHITCHAT
Monday, 6:00 PM and Wednesday at 6:00 PM is happy hour 60 minutes of drawings and Fridays.	CHITCHAT
I do a time lapse at noon.	CHITCHAT
Not on camera is just a quick like a few hours of drawing into a few minutes.	CHITCHAT
Kind of happens and then this stream right now that you're watching late night with fresh cake flagship stream.	CHITCHAT
Saturday night at 10:00 PM.	CHITCHAT
Oof, it was a stressful stream.	CHITCHAT
I got a little it, got a little chaotic.	CHITCHAT
Now the stream is good.	CHITCHAT
I enjoyed when I you know I will admit like I was kinda of scrubbing through.	CHITCHAT
Is watching the replay.	CHITCHAT
I've got a DD but I learned a few things.	CHITCHAT
Like that fancy open source little plug in that you had going, which is super cool.	CHITCHAT
And it's all good.	CHITCHAT
You hold your own.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I got something out of a stream.	CHITCHAT
I learned about a new.	CHITCHAT
I don't know things called I can't remember the name, but I learned about some new software that I didn't know existed in the world.	CHITCHAT
That was awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, see insane thought you handled it well oh what's up Sarah everybody there is another streamer where you just streaming.	CHITCHAT
I swear I like I tuned in for like a hot sex you were trying to match up something on it look like a mouth but like the lines were like a little off there like doing something like this and then you have like the top one was like a little higher.	CHITCHAT
There is also another streamer.	CHITCHAT
Sure, some love.	CHITCHAT
Give her follow.	CHITCHAT
Let us know when you're streaming and, uh, and I'm going to take this a little ink do that.	CHITCHAT
I made this little little little character right here and we're going to scale this up 'cause we get rid of this other random like excess junk that I doodled like these water pipes and my working on feet that wasn't even proper English so the terrible sentence that I just said my working on.	O
Selling caveman.	O
We're going to raise all the stuff 'cause I just want to focus on the little.	O
Little octopus.	O
Um squid, I don't know would have like a thing.	O
I guess it's more of an octopus.	O
So we're going to race all this junk 'cause we don't need it.	O
These are all this rough sketch.	O
I was like making popcorn at one point and amorphous blob over on the other side here and I would use that fancy like you know a racing trick that I do, but.	O
For doing that now, I don't know.	O
Do we want alright question for people in the chat for everybody watching?	O
Ah, do we want to make a fool so?	O
Backup if your new watch my streams welcome.	O
Like I said earlier, but also something that I do in pretty much every stream.	O
I'm always making it so I can make my Instagram grid and my Behance calories with really cool so they gotta have the same color palette and it's a whole thing anyway.	O
Do we want to?	CHITCHAT
So the question for the viewers, do we want to make a like 3 panel image that would stretch across three panels on the IG grid and also would make a really cool big Gallery image?	O
Or do we want to do just the basic square and then will make three similar images throughout the week?	O
Let me know the chat I'm going to kind of scale his character up.	O
'cause if we do the the going to continue if we're going to do the three across, we're probably going to create some kind of crazy scene extension thing here, you know?	O
'cause we got this like octopus kind of hanging out looking all cool.	O
The prophesied something like that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, the early birds get to decide something.	CHITCHAT
The early birds decide something.	CHITCHAT

Let's see Siri finish up a stream so you can hang out for this one.	CHITCHAT
Oh, nice, awesome.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I hope you finish up stream just to join this.	CHITCHAT
I feel really bad.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I like you know I live off you finish your work and then I'll come on.	CHITCHAT
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
This looks like graffiti on a wall of a city at this.	CHITCHAT
OK, yeah, it could be that, you know.	CHITCHAT
And how do you say your name OL studios?	CHITCHAT
How do you say your studio name elves Elvis?	CHITCHAT
I wanna say right let me know in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Thank you though.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it could be like the graffiti thing on the back on a wall.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
That's the wider formats often look like that for sure, and it's always kind of cool too.	CHITCHAT
'cause like.	O
I always like drawing with like the wider formats for that reason and it always kind of attracts some fun clients like you do get quite like questions about that for this kind of stuff on IG or whatever it's like.	O
Oh so you did that really like wide one?	O
It's also fun for doing comping and like hopping into a wall.	O
Later, so I guess we would just have some of this black 'cause the ink would be black with paint across.	O
But again, are we doing this?	CHITCHAT
Where are we doing a wide, uh, wide like you know format kind of illustration.	O
Let me know.	CHITCHAT
I will have to figure that out early on.	O
Otherwise gonna look like a potato.	CHITCHAT
Well, that means bad I guess.	CHITCHAT
Could be kind of cool then we can like really extend these kinds of like.	O
You know tentacles was happening.	O
Weather are you like saying coming in like oh what's happening I'm here or you like being like Yo fresh cake what are you doing?	O
I would check out a wider format.	O
Is this a custom know?	O
So I mean yes it is the custom dimension, but I'll explain, so we'll do a wider format tonight, 'cause I've never actually done one of these on the live stream, so we'll see how far we get.	O
'cause they do take a little bit longer.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
On my cell phone so chat doesn't work right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the chat in the cell phones kinda weird, like sometimes you hit the button scrolls up and then you can type or you can't watch while you're typing then you like try to Scroll down and then you can type.	O
Super bizarre anyway.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so to answer stands question, is this a custom format?	O
It is a custom format so basically for whatever I do like anything span three pans, panels on like in an IG grid, it's going to be 3 squares next to each other, so I gotta find what the square format is usually like.	O
I usually work 2100 by 2100, but for something like this that's a lot of.	O
It's like really big when you triple the one 2100 you end up with $6300.	O
That's like a large.	O
So I created this one.	O
This one is 36 by.	O
Hundred 3600 by 1200.	O
Just kind of make it a little smaller so it's not as taxing on my like crappy old iPad.	O
And it doesn't bog it down.	O
'cause again, I'm working on vector so I can scale things up and do whatever.	O
So we're going to rough sketch in some, like some slimy goopy stuff.	O
It doesn't need to be exactly as you seem to have an idea of where I'm going with it.	O
We can even take this.	CHITCHAT
We can scale it up.	O
We can grab this.	O
We could pull it out.	O
We can make the octopus a little.	O
With wider.	O
I don't know where is it a squid.	O
Like I said earlier, squid have like a hat.	O
Like that, that's the only real difference with them.	O
Like a squid, headache is long gated to like.	O
It's more like that's more of a squid head that has like this thing going.	O
Will do.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's let's let's let's extend one of these technical, so this would probably come a little bit further.	O
Forward, I'm going to grab like this is way out of character for me right now.	O
I'm going to grab this Gray line so I can kind of sketch in.	O
'cause I don't know.	O
Again, this is based off of a rough sketch from this morning, so when I was just warm it up.	O
So I was kind of drawing with like various pencils and stuff and playing around.	O
Usually I do just like that.	O
No photo blue, which a lot of you know, and then I called today at that.	O
Sometimes I add a little red in there, but there will work a little bit of actual charcoal, so just everybody knows this is a pixel brush in fresco that I'm using.	O
It is the sketching brush pencil.	O
No fancy stuff, no smoothing, just literally whatever the generic default settings were is what I went with very basic.	O
I'm gonna make that technical like pop out.	O
Looks like of course it is.	O
That's exactly what it is.	CHITCHAT
Also, why you watch it on your phone?	CHITCHAT
Heather, feel like you are on your computer.	CHITCHAT
It also feels like a really weird thing for me to be like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know you watch your streams on your computer by.	CHITCHAT

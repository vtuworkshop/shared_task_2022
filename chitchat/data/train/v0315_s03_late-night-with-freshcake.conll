Right, so then the blue is going to be where, like all the little kind of there's some like.	O
I guess it'll be some black ink that kind of shootout.	O
It's kind of a bummer 'cause when I stretched it out, I'm realizing now that I lost all that detail underneath which really made it.	O
So we're going to add a lot of that in.	O
So that's going to kind of all go in here.	O
So it's actually get something different.	O
Let's get the red, but we use the red to kind of rough in where where the ink is going to go.	O
And this could be a fun one, like watching my earlier streams from the week.	O
I I was doing some kind of like I don't know.	O
I'll call it soda pop, but like do effects and working with transparencies so.	O
It could be something cool to integrate here.	O
Take something I learned from last week streams.	CHITCHAT
Bring it into this stream.	CHITCHAT
Make something really cool and unique, again with some things that I learned.	CHITCHAT
You know, that's kind of this whole process.	CHITCHAT
This creative process.	CHITCHAT
Also really pretentious when I talk about like the process.	CHITCHAT
But I gotta ask that question once in an interview.	CHITCHAT
Somebody was, like you told me about your process and I was and it's funny.	CHITCHAT
'cause like I know as creators we all have.	CHITCHAT
I know we all have our process if you will, but like I never really had to explain it to anyone before that moment and I sounded like the biggest loser.	CHITCHAT
I was just there like tells about your process when you know you're doing things like well, let me tell you what I do.	CHITCHAT
So I go on the Internet and look at it for awhile and then I yeah, I just kind of think about it.	CHITCHAT
Maybe draw a little just like wow, I really.	CHITCHAT
It's not like I had some like.	CHITCHAT
Crazy thing that I was going to go into depth with like.	CHITCHAT
OK, well first it has to be at least 54 degrees out at 9:00 AM and I spent around three times in the front yard before I drink my coffee.	CHITCHAT
Then like yeah, I don't know what I'm supposed to say like I just think about stuff and then it happens.	CHITCHAT
Not a fan of octopi.	O
Is that a real portal?	CHITCHAT
I don't know fermenter Sam.	CHITCHAT
I'll be honest.	CHITCHAT
I thought you were talking about pies to have like chemicals in it.	CHITCHAT
That should be gross.	CHITCHAT
We're doing a meat pie.	CHITCHAT
We pause are delicious.	CHITCHAT
Let's you watch will be taught in their home.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'll make some like I don't know cloud kind of junk.	CHITCHAT
And it'll probably taper off down here, so will just kind of rough sketch that in I'll figure it out later.	CHITCHAT
I think it occupies the real plural.	CHITCHAT
I don't think they're like geese, you know so well.	CHITCHAT
Wait no moose, yeah sheep you don't say sheeps.	CHITCHAT
So so they would be like I don't know, I'm just blabbing at this point.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to tune in and be like what the hell is This guy talking about?	CHITCHAT
Geese and goose and.	CHITCHAT
Mason moose Is united there?	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
I feel like because I didn't start this one from the ground up right out of the gate.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I couldn't even see the octopi.	O
Oh well.	CHITCHAT
We have to work on that.	O
I'm not good.	CHITCHAT
No, I'm sure you'll see once colors added and everything else.	O
Will get there, will get there.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Sam, I don't know what kind of range just went on like that company for a minute.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So here, let's grab black.	O
Let's just put in some vector lines, don't work.	O
Alright, So what do I want to start I don't know.	O
Let's see we are working with.	O
A again, the canvas size is 3600 by 1200, so we grab our our black vector brush.	O
Really quick for anyone who's new to Frisco.	O
There are three brush sets.	O
There's a pixel brush.	O
A lot of you returning viewers already know this stuff.	O
There's a pixel brush which I used to do the rough lines.	O
Then there's alive brush.	O
We're not going to use that tonight, but it acts like watercolors and stuff.	O
Oh woops, it would help if I had like the watercolor brush picked.	O
Not, oh, I did have the watercolor brush picked.	O
That's crazy.	CHITCHAT
Back like watercolors, really fun.	O
I'm going to be using the back of Russian tonight for this one, so I'm going to dock that little guy down there.	O

Excuse me Alright, so going to set our brush to want to set it to like 8 'cause it's a little bit of a smaller canvas as far as the height goes then I usually use so it down like 8.	O
Set our smoothing up to somewhere in the 80s and they would have pressure dynamic set to 100% and we were going to have velocity dynamic set to.	O
Or do you percent?	CHITCHAT
Oh, you said, how do you get motivated?	O
You gave like a human answer?	O
Yeah, OK, I see what you're saying.	O
Yeah, I know I gave a real human answer.	O
But like seriously, like my processes like I drink coffee in the morning and then I just kind of start drawing.	O
I guess like I wanna bump this up actually a little bit back tonight.	O
I guess part of my process is watching cartoons in the morning like I do watch a great deal currently today.	O
Well for starters.	CHITCHAT
I recently signed up for HBO Max 'cause they got some really cool content on there and I started watching a cartoon this morning called summer camp.	CHITCHAT
Now yeah, summer camp island.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God it's like the cutest show I've ever seen.	CHITCHAT
Everyone seems so friendly in it and very excited to watch more of it.	CHITCHAT
And also we feel Max's Big Bang Theory, which I love that show so very excited to like watch it from start to finish.	CHITCHAT
So we start with the tentacles.	O
No crazy mouse tonight none of that stuff going to focus a lot on like the big folds that are pretty much kind of synonymous with fresh cake illustrations.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And all that kind of good stuff.	O
So Sam, how you look in the 90s?	CHITCHAT
You're 90 sneakers.	CHITCHAT
They're very 90s looking dude where they nikes.	CHITCHAT
I think this would have.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Something I don't like about how I cut this off is that like bottom technical is just going to be like nonexistent, but that's OK.	O
Right, so again, we are creating a like ultrawide kind of illustration.	O
I'd put some suction cups on the octopus, but.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Or the octopi?	O
What do we decided it's just?	O
It's only one, so it's not plural, right?	O
Max also has.	CHITCHAT
Yeah they have Adventure Time distant lands.	CHITCHAT
The bimo episodes I saw that on there went to watch it.	CHITCHAT
You know I never actually finished Adventure Time I fell out of it when when the creator kind of moved off and went into just storyboarding.	CHITCHAT
I thought the 1st and 2nd season were incredible and then I just kind of started to lose focus with it and then yeah, when he decided to lose his name.	CHITCHAT
Pendleton Ward when Pendleton decided to kind of bow out for a hot 2nd take a backseat with things which can't blame him, you know?	CHITCHAT
Uh, that stuff get stressful?	CHITCHAT
Aside from doing illustration, I work quite a bit in broadcast TV and it is not easy to say the least, and so yeah, I guess he took a backseat and started kind of just focusing on doing some writing and storyboarding for the show and.	CHITCHAT
When I finally kind of started to fall off a little bit, but I will say I feel like the show really.	CHITCHAT
I feel like Adventure Time really, really kind of set the stage for a lot of cartoon networks like future programming, which which is awesome.	CHITCHAT
Because a lot of shows I feel like kind of mirror that like I I do feel a little bit like.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I can see hints of it in stuff like summer camp island.	CHITCHAT
So there are you big like cartoon fan.	CHITCHAT
I should say are you a big cartoon fan too?	CHITCHAT
Because I love my cartoons.	CHITCHAT
Like, really like reality TV an you know live action shows.	CHITCHAT
Take him or leave him.	CHITCHAT
If it doesn't have colors screaming in my face.	CHITCHAT
It's whatever.	CHITCHAT
Like not that into it.	CHITCHAT
Are you love cartoons?	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT

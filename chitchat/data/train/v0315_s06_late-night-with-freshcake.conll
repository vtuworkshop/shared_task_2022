Alright, so let's let's let's lower the opacity of our rough sketch.	O
Forgot our squid thing in place.	O
We got pretty eyes and it's pretty eyes.	O
Take a new layer.	O
Remember shape tool and let's make it a circle.	O
'cause eyeballs are circular.	O
Let's move it over, so here, so take this here and let's put it there.	O
So we are 30 minutes into the stream.	CHITCHAT
I want to point out this stream is called late night with fresh cake.	CHITCHAT
It happen Saturdays at 9:00 PM.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes little later, depending.	CHITCHAT
But it's a fun stream.	CHITCHAT
The longer stream and at the top of the hour on the stream I do a comic book review when I talk about a comic book that I really really like called Let's all comics.	CHITCHAT
Tonight I'll be talking about Sarah Anderson should make some really cool stuff.	CHITCHAT

So if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.	CHITCHAT
In the chat, I would love to answer them to the best of my ability.	CHITCHAT
And if I can answer something, I'll do my best to figure it out, you know.	CHITCHAT
Also, if you are new to watching please say hello.	CHITCHAT
You know and let us know your favorite cartoon is we've got Brazilian animation going on.	CHITCHAT
We got Adventure Time.	CHITCHAT
Without South Park.	CHITCHAT
I was watching the old Looney tunes to this morning.	CHITCHAT
Oh man, so good.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're just gonna put that there.	O
So the eyeball has a little bit of like A.	O
Don't they have like one eye is not like a thing?	O
This is an octopus have.	O
And they have like 4 hearts I don't know.	O
You don't know that you can pick a favorite cartoon like music.	CHITCHAT
You can't pick a favorite band, you know.	CHITCHAT
Or movie.	CHITCHAT
I think for that kind of stuff, like the way to identify.	CHITCHAT
What your favorite is is to just be like what's the one that you default to the mouse like.	CHITCHAT
I probably watch Futurama and regular show the most, so those are probably the two cartoons that I default to.	CHITCHAT
All the time.	CHITCHAT
So I moved everything down really quick.	O
Want to point this out because I had started to form what's called a tangent, which is when you have like you make a piece of art and you have something else like if there's like an object coming in right here and it like just barely touches this like that's annoying.	O
Handed.	O
So I'm just kind of moved everything down so we're going to turn off pressure, velocity dynamics just so I can.	O
Kinda rough in another eyeball on the back part here.	O
So Heather, if you're still tuned in are you are you are doing tonight.	CHITCHAT
I know.	CHITCHAT
I think you're saying that you generally generally create something during the stream.	CHITCHAT
Since it's a little bit of a longer one, I'd be curious to know if you're making something fun.	CHITCHAT
Who's drawn along with me?	CHITCHAT
Who's arting?	CHITCHAT
You don't know what I'm talking about from the last stream on Wednesday, the happy hour we were talking about what we do and when we create and Heather decide to point out that she arts, which I thought was a very creative way to describe making something because it's true.	CHITCHAT
That's what we do, our King.	CHITCHAT
Auto gyro Oh my God, it's such a good one Jessica Awesome pic that's also on Max.	CHITCHAT

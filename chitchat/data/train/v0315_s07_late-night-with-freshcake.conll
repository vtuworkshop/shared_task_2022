Where are my?	CHITCHAT
Thank you Jack for posting it deeply.	CHITCHAT
Deeply is that outside Ghibli?	CHITCHAT
I'm I found really interesting that that's on.	CHITCHAT
Max on HBO maxed out because I thought Disney bought them, but I guess not.	CHITCHAT
Maybe maybe Warner did.	CHITCHAT
Everybody's getting owned by the same companies at this point.	CHITCHAT
Where are my anime fans at?	CHITCHAT
Are there anybody?	CHITCHAT
Is anyone in the chat here?	CHITCHAT
Big anime fans?	CHITCHAT
If so, please say hello and let me know what your favorite anime is.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Colonel minus.	CHITCHAT
Kind of thing now it's one that I always go back to.	CHITCHAT
One punch man I watched I watched a few Times Now.	CHITCHAT
Place some of that two or three times twice.	CHITCHAT
And I like one punch man alive.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it counts as my favorite.	CHITCHAT
Very nice fresco allows drawing beyond the canvas.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it does.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't want to pixel brush but it does with the vector brush.	CHITCHAT
I find that very interesting Pokémon.	CHITCHAT
Listen, Sam, don't get me started on Pokémon.	CHITCHAT
We've had this conversation before.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't go well for you all, right?	CHITCHAT
Doctor all about it.	CHITCHAT
how I find it very weird that the Pokémon can only say their names like don't make any other noises, just that you feel lazy.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's put some miles from spreading.	O
Blow this guy or girl.	O
But gender neutral really matter.	O
I'm going to make it kind of like puffy, puffy and cloudy.	O
Or do we want to be like?	O
Oh, I like that better.	CHITCHAT
OK, we're going to go down this road.	O
'cause we gotta do?	CHITCHAT
What kind of like this?	CHITCHAT
Like there's so many ways to make like A.	O
To make a like a cloud kind of vibe in my style.	O
Here I'll show you over here this several ways that I make puffy things.	O
One is to do something like this.	O
Where it's a little bit more like a goo, and then you kind of add these like.	O
These, like you know blobs, that kind of shoot off.	O
That's always really fun the other way that I do it is by kind of creating like.	O
These like 100 overlapping shapes where they kind of do things like.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
But that runs the risk of looking like intestines, so we're going to we're going to end up doing this.	O
Has got to be a little more fluid, so we're going to do it this way.	O
True.	CHITCHAT
Now I know that I'm kind of like crudely dropping these in and none of my points are kind of, you know, connecting, creating clean lines and it looks really weird with having the main character sort of, you know, all the transparency.	O
It's all good, but I turned it off.	CHITCHAT
I hope it looks decent.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We're going to find out a whole lot of this is just experimenting.	O
The reason why the transparency set down though, so I can clean up and do things like this.	O
So fun little fresco trick for anyone wondering how I'm racing so quickly 'cause I often get asked this question.	O
If you tap your little dial here with your brush selected it turns it into an eraser and then to get rid of this line quickly instead of sitting here going like this because that's a pain in the butt.	O
If you have that thing still selected and you drag down making the circle solid and you just kind of draw this blue line, you can get rid of stuff whatever the blue line cuts through will disappear.	O
So helpful trick.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for raising things quickly.	CHITCHAT
Easy.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see here.	CHITCHAT
And let's go over and take another new layer.	O
Let's just start kind of put in some of the bigger cloudy areas are going to fill the scene.	O
So we're going to draw right through.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
We're just going to write through kind of the leg here, and the reason for this 'cause we're, we turn it all up and fill everything in and kind of race things and merge everything together.	O

It'll look good.	CHITCHAT
The reason why I draw through right there, so you kind of make sure that you know.	O
If this were a real thing, this would kind of actually expand down into their now just feel a little weird.	O
So add a little kind of shape.	O
Maybe in here I don't know.	O
It will kind of help it out.	O
Drawn right through stuff like this kind of allows for like easier cleanup.	O
No already.	CHITCHAT
I gotta say, I asked.	CHITCHAT
Norm's favorite anime is and I'm kind of surprised that it didn't really outside Sheridan.	CHITCHAT
Surprise, I didn't really get a lot of responses.	CHITCHAT
I thought I was going to have quite a few there.	CHITCHAT
Everybody sharing Electra is another streamer here.	CHITCHAT
Gotta Streamers today watching.	CHITCHAT
I kinda like it.	CHITCHAT
I gotta get up streamer and chat graphic going.	CHITCHAT
Going to make 1.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
More things to do added to the list.	CHITCHAT
Now I say that lovingly, it's fun making up all the assets and stuff for the streams.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so Speaking of which, I am going to be adding a new stream to the list, so I do four streams right now for week two of them are called happy hour.	CHITCHAT
They happen Monday and Wednesday at 6:00 PM and then I do Fridays at noon, a timelapse, vertical bunch of art, few hours of drawing condensed into a few minutes.	CHITCHAT
It's like a good bite size lunch break, kind of viewing.	CHITCHAT
Kind of experiencing anyway, so those three and then I do this one right here.	CHITCHAT
But I am going to be adding a new one relatively soon called random stream.	CHITCHAT
And just like the name says.	CHITCHAT
Is a random stream.	CHITCHAT
Guess what?	CHITCHAT
It just happens randomly like whatever the heck.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it so the only way really be able to see that is if you give me a follow up here on the hand.	CHITCHAT
So if you like what you're watching right now and like hearing me Apple lot, give me a follow behance.net backslash fresh cake and you'll get you know get notified when I go live and then you won't miss the random stream and you can watch him on replays.	CHITCHAT
I don't know when the random streams gonna happen 'cause you know it's random OC that doesn't match.	CHITCHAT
It's gotta be like this.	CHITCHAT
But it's going to be a mix of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I'll be drawing.	CHITCHAT
There's going to be some video content.	CHITCHAT
I'll be showing some things, for example on the next random stream whenever it happens at some point.	CHITCHAT
The very first one I do know is going to be a video collaboration from print shop that I worked with to create this really cool vinyl on wood illustration thing.	CHITCHAT
Sort of like video packages.	CHITCHAT
That kind of stuff something a little bit different than just me drawing on an iPad and talking to all of you all the time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no problem.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for sharing.	CHITCHAT
It says you are totally welcome.	CHITCHAT
Please feel free to plug any other streamers.	CHITCHAT
Like I said earlier, I think mentioned this era and Jack.	CHITCHAT
Feel free plug yourselves in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Please put your schedules there so everyone can TuneIn and anyone watching that does not follow them.	CHITCHAT
Please give them a follow.	CHITCHAT
Also, for the regulars who had been watching the streams, have you found the one you really liked and you can't say me?	CHITCHAT
I don't count your watching right now, so I'm assuming that are just watching me 'cause you're like.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna make fun of this pool.	CHITCHAT
Damn, I'm looking at you anyway.	CHITCHAT
Let me know who you're watching that you really like right now.	CHITCHAT
'cause you know, I watch a lot of streams too.	CHITCHAT
And maybe you're watching someone that I haven't found yet and I want to watch when I catch up.	CHITCHAT
I want to be cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's just looking like goop goop goop.	O
Alright let's, let's do a couple things, or at 43 minutes in full die so fast.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's watch this down.	CHITCHAT
Let's turn up the opacity, unless this merges altogether.	O
Oh, wait, no, let's not do that yet.	CHITCHAT
We gotta clean up some stuff like this little area.	O
One thing I do want to point out that gets kind of weird like I'm going to clean it would be very careful like a surgeon.	O
So they want to be careful about sometimes, so like those little folds that I add, if it goes down below something and it doesn't have like a like, it looks like it gets.	O
Like this like how it looked.	O
It just looks like a mistake so try to keep a little bit of distance.	O
Kind of between that looks like this little space here.	O
A favorite anime is probably ghost in the shell you know Sarah.	CHITCHAT
I've never actually watched.	CHITCHAT
Ghost in the shell like kind of embarrassed about that.	CHITCHAT
I feel like that's something that I should have.	CHITCHAT
Had to choose very yeah, sharing to watch the stream.	CHITCHAT
You have to choose a favorite anime otherwise.	CHITCHAT
The stream just cut out like if you watch 5 minutes and you don't tell me exactly who you like it just it just shuts off.	CHITCHAT
I don't know that worked out with Adobe or they were like you.	CHITCHAT
Sure you want this features like yes very.	CHITCHAT
Now you don't have to pick one if you don't.	CHITCHAT
If you don't know.	CHITCHAT
You know it's up to you.	CHITCHAT
You can share.	CHITCHAT
Share your fave if you have one, but you know what?	CHITCHAT

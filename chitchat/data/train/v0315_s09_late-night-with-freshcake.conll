It's all good.	CHITCHAT
No pressure.	CHITCHAT
You know we should add in some of this sort of detail.	O
Like in here.	O
We also everyone our wish like.	O
I feel like I'm going about this like I have a lot of confidence, but I'm looking at it right now.	O
I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
It's a good one.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm gonna check it out.	CHITCHAT
Jack is informative, Sir.	CHITCHAT
Getting this out.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to decide.	CHITCHAT
You have to pick Sam.	CHITCHAT
Now Sam, your favorite Pok√©mon that counts.	CHITCHAT
Also, I had this really bizarre like debate with myself along time ago, 'cause I thought Aeon flux was an anime.	CHITCHAT
Simply basing that on the House animated, I'm going to be honest, but I don't think it is.	CHITCHAT
Who is the creator from my California?	CHITCHAT
Also fun fact they do.	CHITCHAT
That made aeon flux also makes Rugrats so.	CHITCHAT
Some more cartoon knowledge bombs for everybody.	CHITCHAT
Favorite anime is probably full metal Alchemist Brotherhood.	CHITCHAT
Fullmetal alchemist is awesome.	CHITCHAT
I've never actually fully watched or finish the entire series, but from what I have seen, it's really really good.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's let's start coloring this dude, and then we'll add some detail and you know the whole thing looks really cool.	O
Alright, move that way.	O
For color, let's start out with.	O
Here, let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Let's do a couple things.	O
Let's make a new layer.	O
Let's grab the color white.	O
NASA, Phyllis in no way to color.	O
The absence of color.	O
Wasn't light then.	O
It's all the colors combined.	O
Whatever pick white and film background or Gray or whatever you want does matter.	O
Merge down and then let's shut off this background layer and then we're going to take the paint bucket still selected.	O
We're going to hit a little toggle.	O
We're going to tap.	O
Oh whoops, we have our layer selected where tap we're going to create an Alpha out of this.	O
Just get rid of that stuff so we can properly see you know the scene.	O
Let's make a new layer and let's pick A.	O
We don't need a background color yet to turn that back on.	O
Turn on the background.	O
Alright, let's now the reason why did that is 'cause when I start adding in a background color like let's say.	O
This color here.	O
Our character will still have, you know.	O
Some kind of fill to it, so we're not just looking through the background color, just seeing Linework Rugrats.	O
Really, yes.	CHITCHAT
Yep, they do.	CHITCHAT
That made aeon flux made Rugrats, which is super weird when when you like.	CHITCHAT
Think about that for a minute.	CHITCHAT
'cause like that shows are very different.	CHITCHAT
But now that you know that, watch like one episode or like just look at some images.	CHITCHAT
Going to watch episodes.	CHITCHAT
What one episode of each on a TV next to each other and watch Movies Now that you know that if you look at some images though from the shows, you'll see the similarities.	CHITCHAT
Oh thanks so much Sarah.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Just now I watch everything OK, fair enough.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
I like that color for the background.	O
Let's go to my colors are also in fresco.	O
If you hit recent under your color, you have your like you know your color wheel and you can.	O
You know HSV sliders and everything else.	O
But if you go to your if you go to the tablets is alittle access your CC library.	O
So if you use the Adobe creative cloud and you're not utilizing CC a whole lot you should start because all that stuff port through to pretty much all the apps you can make really cool stuff like the full category, have club colors rule with a whole bunch of fun colors.	O
Some of these I've made I've been on like a red cake.	O
Very excuse me.	CHITCHAT
Little bit alright cake clearly, but you can create some really cool color palettes like.	O
Actually, this is kind of fun.	O
Hold on.	CHITCHAT
And you can use them just by selecting them and then you know happen to fill stuff in.	O
Let's pick a line.	O
Let's pick a color for line work and let's.	O
Let's see what do I do here?	O
This is the other thing.	O
Now 'cause Elvis or else is the eldest.	O
I feel like that's how it said anyway.	O
Something that's really weird with the whole like Yes, you can draw pasture artboard, but when you feel things in it doesn't fill past the art board.	O
I don't know why fresco does that, it's very odd.	O
I don't know why I didn't just fill all this stuff in to begin with, but it's all good.	O
Hi.	CHITCHAT
That's looking kinda cool actually.	CHITCHAT
I like that color.	CHITCHAT

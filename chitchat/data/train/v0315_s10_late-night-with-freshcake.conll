Bright colors make me happy too.	CHITCHAT
I'm with you.	CHITCHAT
Oops, I like I I go between different color palettes like all the time.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes things are very like vibrant and then other times are like way more like subdued and it's really funny because if you look at my IG account right now, like at eat fresh cake, that's not handled by the way.	CHITCHAT
If anyone wants to follow.	CHITCHAT
If you look at it right now, it's very like it's very like pink and blue and there's a lot of pastel colors going on.	O

Also studied broadcast media or broadcast and digital media production and so.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm telling you that is because I had to take a lot of really cool classes that involve cameras and lights and all these other things in our project.	CHITCHAT

Like watch this now I can like get rid of that.	O
Oh no wait cancel never mind.	O
Oh, but if I do this and like let's pick like a crazy color like this green now like it doesn't change the top part and it won't fill in that region even though it created the shape.	O
So I don't understand.	CHITCHAT
That's all about.	CHITCHAT
But really quick, this green color is really cool.	O

Yeah, that's my song for it.	CHITCHAT
Drawing outline and then fill it in.	O
OK, so you're saying?	CHITCHAT
I thought all the shapes had to be closed in order to fill the middle with the bucket.	O
No, you can draw a shape out of the art board and then it closes it off where the art borders and you can still feel it.	O
Yes, that is that is right.	CHITCHAT

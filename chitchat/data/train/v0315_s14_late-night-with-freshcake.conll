I think in the game I'm like nearing the end and I've been prolonging until my daughter goes best I can beat it tonight 'cause.	CHITCHAT
Famous so.	CHITCHAT
Damn long, Oh my God, it's like brutal.	CHITCHAT
I came here to relax 'cause my heart was about 6 lug all your in Hillcrest at like 12 or 13 hours in my friend beat the whole game in 27 but I'm playing survivor.	CHITCHAT
OK yeah I'm on your friends level.	CHITCHAT
I'm going for like a 25 hour playthrough.	CHITCHAT
Sound like that whatever the minimum is.	CHITCHAT
I was on my way.	CHITCHAT
Oh what's going on in you in.	CHITCHAT
I was going.	CHITCHAT
He thinks it's going to take.	CHITCHAT
Yeah might take you.	CHITCHAT
One of my friends is it did what you're doing.	CHITCHAT
I think it took him like roughly 40.	CHITCHAT
Maybe like in the 30s.	CHITCHAT
Somewhere in the 30s I think is very finished out.	CHITCHAT
I'm.	CHITCHAT
I am I was going for the long run a matter fact.	CHITCHAT
It's funny that you're in Hillcrest, 'cause when I was in the Hillcrest level Is really what I was like really exploring in like going into every building and making sure I didn't miss anything and then somewhere in the game my pace changed drastically and I started just sprinting through levels.	CHITCHAT
I was like I can't do this.	CHITCHAT
I need to know what happens next in the story is a very intense game like like.	CHITCHAT
If anyone is playing it out there, yeah, it'll make you feel thanks for sure.	CHITCHAT
I just got here we go.	CHITCHAT
What difficulty you plan on?	CHITCHAT
I'll be totally honest with you.	CHITCHAT
I am playing it on like like a noob.	CHITCHAT
The reason why I'm playing it on light though is because I want to actually enjoy the story and I have a daughter and she wakes up from Naps and cries and does all sorts of things.	CHITCHAT
I'm saying excuses to be honest with you.	CHITCHAT
I probably could have up the challenge level a little bit.	CHITCHAT
But I'm playing a light because.	CHITCHAT
I'm scared now I'm playing I'm playing like 'cause I can't just like sit down and like focus and grind away at a level like if I played on anything harder I would never beat the game 'cause I get interrupted every so often 'cause I have to be dad.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
So that's Why.	CHITCHAT
Very selective what games I up the difficulty on.	CHITCHAT
I couldn't play a game on survivor, though I wouldn't make it.	CHITCHAT
How's your daughter mind 3 mine is 8 months.	CHITCHAT
You showed me up with a daughter thinks you're like I got a kid too haha.	CHITCHAT
I'm playing on difficult.	CHITCHAT
You could blame other hand coworker I I no longer thank you, put me on a Dark Souls.	CHITCHAT
My life hasn't been the same since.	CHITCHAT
We play the misery.	CHITCHAT
Well, it's funny.	CHITCHAT
The irony is that he never beat Dark Souls, even wow.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm uh, I'm not one for grinding either.	CHITCHAT
Like like I enjoy the story a lot in games and so I'll happily play 2 on an easier difficulty if it means I get to just like really kind of focus and enjoy the story more.	CHITCHAT
This is not a lot of like bubbles.	CHITCHAT
Never had a chance to play it.	CHITCHAT
You never even played the original.	CHITCHAT
The first one.	CHITCHAT
I'm saying like I'd remain, it is better.	CHITCHAT
Right now I'm learning this bubble here.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't make any sense 'cause.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't do anything for me.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I, uh.	CHITCHAT
I like I.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be honest playing this game.	CHITCHAT
It's funny talking about this playing this game on.	CHITCHAT
On light or easy.	CHITCHAT
Is making me want to play games on easy, more 'cause I'm just kind of like well I like going through level like I'm not in it for.	CHITCHAT
Like I'm not like trying to like up my KD score anything.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kind of like OK, I'm here to enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to convert you Dave the other side I like now.	CHITCHAT
Did you start playing games on easy?	CHITCHAT
Why you stressing yourself out?	CHITCHAT
Man, just relax.	CHITCHAT
Eight months is good to game 'cause you got like at least a solid hour or two for nap.	CHITCHAT
I think yes it's true, but see if I play that game on on on hard that whole hour I would have.	CHITCHAT
I don't know when I was done I would've spent the entire hour trying to kill like one clicker.	CHITCHAT
Of.	CHITCHAT
But that is true.	CHITCHAT
It is a good age is a good age for gaming.	CHITCHAT
I agree it was better for gaming six months and then prior to that was when she was like 2 months.	CHITCHAT

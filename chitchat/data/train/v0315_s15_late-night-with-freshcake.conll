The puzzles in this one or a lot easier to solve than the last one.	CHITCHAT
I can watch any part of a sleeping.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be honest with you, my wife and I got really lucky.	CHITCHAT
Our daughter sleeps like it blew our minds.	CHITCHAT
There was a night.	CHITCHAT
Well, two months is Ella exaggeration.	CHITCHAT
But like the three month mark, she started sleeping longer.	CHITCHAT
But there was a night where we thought we missed a feeding because you shoot wake us up or alarm Clock would go off.	CHITCHAT
But we we like woke up in the morning and were like Oh my God she didn't eat.	CHITCHAT
Last night we missed the feeling like horrible.	CHITCHAT
We went in there like things like freaking out no dead asleep like my daughter sleeps so well I'm spoiled by it.	CHITCHAT
As much people acting like I was talking about, kids don't have one.	CHITCHAT
Like what happened the other night yesterday she went to bed at Seven 7:30 and slept till 8:30 the next morning.	CHITCHAT
My daughter sleeps in.	CHITCHAT
That's great.	CHITCHAT
Oh sure, you will be no.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, that's why I'm not having another one.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Just make it.	CHITCHAT
Let's make a big dot there.	CHITCHAT
Race will probably be done with doing this part.	CHITCHAT
Sorry that was very tedious.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully we had the conversation.	CHITCHAT
Everyone enjoyed it.	CHITCHAT
Good luck Mr.	CHITCHAT
Oh Yeah, I think my kids getting tired of me through this whole thing.	CHITCHAT
Five finger optionally coming out like alright.	CHITCHAT
Thinking that one luck.	CHITCHAT
Alrighty.	CHITCHAT

Yes, the pandemic is made going outside very difficult, although I did go to the beer store today.	CHITCHAT
Went out public is crazy.	CHITCHAT
I like I realize that like I mean I don't get out much to begin with.	CHITCHAT
'cause I work from home and.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, so.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't really go outside a whole lot.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I like to go outside like I go outdoors in like hiking stuff, but like I don't.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't go to the bar that often, you know?	CHITCHAT
And now the whole pandemic thing and everything being closed.	CHITCHAT
It just has like exasperated that now even further so now I just go out even less so.	CHITCHAT
Today I finally was like I need to go outside and I'm going to go mountain biking, but that didn't happen.	CHITCHAT
'cause there ain't so.	CHITCHAT
And there was like Thunder and lightning and something about riding a giant piece of Â£40 metal doesn't sound appealing enough under storm, so I so files like I need to get out.	CHITCHAT
So I went to the liquor store and I bought some beers.	CHITCHAT
I bought a South answers later.	CHITCHAT
I remember the companies just looks really good.	CHITCHAT
Nothing to drink one later I beat the Last of Us.	CHITCHAT
That's my plan.	CHITCHAT
And then watch cartoons.	CHITCHAT
Watch them.	CHITCHAT

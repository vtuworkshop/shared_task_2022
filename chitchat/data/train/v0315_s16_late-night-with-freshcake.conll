Let's show a great tunes.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm thinking about it.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I'll pay Interstate tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
My first vacation tomorrow for three days at some beach house.	CHITCHAT
Thank God the weirdest thing just happened.	CHITCHAT
OK, go ahead.	CHITCHAT
Describe sounds like I'm at a beach house too.	CHITCHAT
Get rid of that line.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we got all this detail now in so we're done putting that part in.	O
I feel like people are like Oh my gosh guys, still filling stuff in filling in dots.	CHITCHAT
We also with me here like we're all good.	CHITCHAT
Lost their attention spans are probably pretty short now, Alright, let's see how we feel with the colours we like and everything.	O
So we still change the stuff we want.	CHITCHAT
Now it's time to do it.	CHITCHAT
Come out, start answering serious detail on this thing.	O
You know would be cool, just make a new layer, let's grab.	O
Let's take our line work color.	O
This dark are kind of Orange.	O
Let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Let's fill that in.	O
Now we've got some depth, some other stuff going on now.	O
Don't worry, I'm not going to put a whole bunch of dots and stuff in the background.	O
Or am I probably, but they a lot faster than doing the other way.	O
'cause I feel like filament and do all the line work.	O
This just creates a nice little bit of.	O
Like I said, some something in the space appreciating some depth.	O
Whatever you wanna call it.	O
Just kind of adds to the illustration a little more.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Hi, what's going on here we got?	CHITCHAT
Is watching the audio cut out and then it went back to the beginning and you were talking about the start of the stream 1000 miles up?	CHITCHAT
Oh wow, that's weird.	CHITCHAT
You are the toilets on sale.	CHITCHAT
I haven't streamed in 30 years now.	CHITCHAT
There was a kernel on the plane.	CHITCHAT
Dave says anyone ever say your art is like a nightmare mixed with some drugs to make it feel friendlier, like Alice in Wonderland, but you get that all the time 'cause it's like Monsters but friendly monsters but not like Sesame Street Friendly?	CHITCHAT
No, I've actually never gotten that.	CHITCHAT
Although this is a really funny story.	CHITCHAT
The Prophet story like that it's not funny, so I realized that I was on location for a client project.	CHITCHAT
They want to have a mural installed vinyl like we print out like something like this will get printed vinyl and installed in the restaurant and I was there with the client and we were talking about the wall and I was showing some rough sketches and kind of what we were going to go for and his wife FaceTime him and he gets on the phone with her and psychoanalyze me like answers things like hey what's going on honey and she's like hi how are you like?	CHITCHAT
I'm here with the artists like oh how's it going?	CHITCHAT
What's this art?	CHITCHAT
Looks like he's like oh it's so cool it's like perfect for the kids.	CHITCHAT
And he shows her like I had given him some stickers that day.	CHITCHAT
It shows him her up like a sticker and he's like look like this was art.	CHITCHAT
Looks like she's Oh my God, that's scary like right behind because I no, no, it's fine.	CHITCHAT
It's good.	CHITCHAT
Oh it's either he's like Yeah but you didn't hear ya I'm like free here bro like super weird.	CHITCHAT
But I've never gotten that that much of a in depth description, but I like it.	CHITCHAT
I like the pink, but I think I want to see more colors in this piece.	O
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I was thinking about doing some more colours were talking about that a little earlier and then kind of headed out here.	O
I was playing around like if I was going to add more colors I was going to add to the actual octopus I was playing around like these like kind of.	O
Blue sort of colors.	O
Which I really liked, but I felt little harsh on the eyes so.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I like the thought a lot.	CHITCHAT
And adding more you know just more.	CHITCHAT

I think it's just the two characters like going on weird adventures fighting.	CHITCHAT
Messed up, let's go to the movies.	CHITCHAT
Characters, you know.	CHITCHAT
By the way, if anyone knows what I got references I just said there's like the old, you know, let's all go to the movies that it's like they're all like a dancing hotdog on prime.	CHITCHAT
You can watch 45 minutes of that FYIA some companies strong 'em all out.	CHITCHAT
I'm not watching it, but I intend to.	CHITCHAT
You wanna talk about drugged out monster things?	CHITCHAT
Dave, that's definitely one.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's just like gross.	CHITCHAT
Let's grab the circle tool again.	O
Let's put some like gross blemishes, but these little larger not going to like suction cups, but we're going to definitely do something like that.	O
Now I would just use my brush with a pressure dynamic turned on and rely on the pressure that I push with my hand to create.	O
Like you know the size, but for this I wanted to be more kind of like Oval shaped since they're kind of all these chemicals and they're going to be stretched out.	O
Hell boy jacking it up.	CHITCHAT
Day there was actually a Kickstarter for some game that was 100% rip off of Cuphead stood out 'cause it looks amazing and everyone was sad 'cause.	O
So those are Apple.	CHITCHAT
If I got it.	CHITCHAT
This is clearly the designer had no idea.	CHITCHAT
Use all the time.	CHITCHAT
All that time to something awesome and it would never be used in the real world.	CHITCHAT
That's sad.	CHITCHAT
Like where the characters actual cups and stuff that is a bummer for that do also.	CHITCHAT
I don't want the research 'cause I'm sure he didn't know and I've done that before by accident.	CHITCHAT
Like anyone out there that's a designer ever design something and then be like, oh, this is very similar to blank.	CHITCHAT
That actually so that happened with me on a project last year.	CHITCHAT
Not making this up.	CHITCHAT
Uh, we always asked to work on a series.	CHITCHAT
You guys to look this up with at work on a series called at the time it was called.	CHITCHAT
What is it called on fire or something like that?	CHITCHAT
And it was all about this dude goes out any grills.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I'm definitely going to come from somebody for this, so he goes out, he grills and all this other stuff and he doesn't much like cooking in nature.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
The logo was supposed to feel like a bourbon kinda vibe like he's grilling is outside very manly so we do this like this answer blocky kind of condensed typeface for the logo treatment and it had like an O with O's question.	CHITCHAT
I had a little like bar underneath it.	CHITCHAT
'cause it was supposed to like feel like I don't know like a number thing or whatever.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It just felt like it fit the brand, not the boy.	CHITCHAT
They change the name to Stoke 'cause he stoking the fire.	CHITCHAT
So we just took the same type treatment.	CHITCHAT
'cause I liked the client like the type treatment a lot and they're like Leadside treatment but change the name to.	CHITCHAT
So there so we did it and then we found out later there is a brand of coffee called stock.	CHITCHAT
And guess what?	CHITCHAT
The logos are almost identical.	CHITCHAT
Yep, so happen to me 'cause I'm blender loops.	CHITCHAT
Should Emma research better?	CHITCHAT
Don't ever say anything though.	CHITCHAT
So I guess we're OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy, alright look at this.	CHITCHAT
Right, I mean everybody.	CHITCHAT
Alright Dave, I'm looking this up.	CHITCHAT
I had a cool Brazilian cartoons on here.	CHITCHAT
Who also?	CHITCHAT
Should while I'm here.	CHITCHAT
She make Dave a MoD because.	CHITCHAT
Well Dave, wait where can I find you?	CHITCHAT
I can make your MoD so you don't pop up.	CHITCHAT
That's super weird.	CHITCHAT

Same time man.	CHITCHAT
Oh, Amanda, I had something to share with you.	CHITCHAT
Actually I haven't put it in the discord.	CHITCHAT
Well, rather for everybody, but I know you like coffee a lot, so more specifically geared tordue.	CHITCHAT
For anyone out there, those coffee, I started using this thing called trade recently and they ship you a new bag of coffee like putting like it's like you know, like you know, those things like Citrix and all those other brands where they like send you a box of stuff and then you pick what you like, kind of localized.	CHITCHAT
We put it like what you like for coffee and then they send you a different bag every 2 three weeks.	CHITCHAT
You pick how often you want your coffee to come but they send you a new bag of something that's like on Taylor two.	CHITCHAT
You're like flavor profile and then you rate it after you get the bag and you try it and then they kind of that helps.	CHITCHAT
Better pick.	CHITCHAT
New copies that you that you might enjoy.	CHITCHAT
Really super cool.	CHITCHAT
We got our first bag and it was delicious atomic I think was the name of the company, their mild roast or whatever was medium blend.	CHITCHAT
Local attic right here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm with you.	CHITCHAT
That sounds rad.	CHITCHAT
Is it your space?	CHITCHAT
So I don't know.	CHITCHAT

If you just look up drink, trade, I think is the website.	CHITCHAT
Um or trade car.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, I'm going to add some bubbles and stuff in there and some like lighter shades just to kind of help indicate that it's a liquid.	O

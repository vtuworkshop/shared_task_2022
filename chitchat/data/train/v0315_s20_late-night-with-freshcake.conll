If not, looks kinda friendly.	O
Oh, that's metal, keep it.	O
Alright, let's see here.	CHITCHAT

Full drying, my place had the like AC crank it for a few days and I turned it off now so that.	CHITCHAT
Which is getting kinda hard, but I had to do it 'cause otherwise you hear fan blowing constantly not be annoying.	CHITCHAT

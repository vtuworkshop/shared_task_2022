Let's grab our line work and let's grab our vector brush.	CHITCHAT
Let's make a another new layer, let's turn it down, but we'll turn down as far we're going to do our shading.	O
So to do the shading, we're just going to kind of done alot.	O
More makeup brush alot fat or two.	O
Home is going to kind of trace in here.	O
It's going to follow along along the line work.	O
Now we can we would like or.	O
Do you want to do this kind of shade where I add like that could be really cool nice, alright, let's go back let's do that so we're going to kind of draw these like.	O
I don't know Blobby sort of shapes and fill them in with my paint bucket gab.	O
Feel like I want to do this though in like a darker blue hold on.	O

It does look way better.	CHITCHAT
OK, hold on.	CHITCHAT
Is there a blend mode that would help?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Well, not a problem here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to duplicate this dude.	O
We're bringing up above.	O
We're just going to knockout the light blue.	O
The reason why I'm doing this is because I want to be able to have those shadows in a darker blue.	O
They want me to make sure that that's fully.	O
Knocked out one of those shadows in a darker blue like you can see down in here.	O
Inside the source quit dude, but I want my line work to lay on top because I want to be able to kind of draw around on it.	O

It.	CHITCHAT
Is.	CHITCHAT
And that way if I want to print this out, is going to have to work on my printer and actually let's go back.	CHITCHAT
We call this.	CHITCHAT
She.	CHITCHAT
I'll be original Airport International.	CHITCHAT
And then let's unlock.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
Jump into this group and I'm just gonna grab my little character.	O
Down here.	O
Alright cool, so I'm going to make him a little bit smaller because he's going to be the basis for my reference.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And now I'm going to create a new layer for some guides.	O
Cool and if you are just joining the chat, we're just getting started for the night.	CHITCHAT
I'll be streaming for the next couple of hours working on a character, turn around and the full character sheet, maybe do some expression exploration of this little character whose name is chicken yellow.	O
He is an egg yolk.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's what that's what we're going to work on.	O

So the first thing first thing I'm going to do as I start thinking about this character turn around and it's not to draw ellipses, but.	O
To draw.	O
Some straight lines.	O
That are going to be guides.	O
Floor, the turnarounds, and so I'm going to give myself a let's go with the blue ish.	O
Outline this is going to help me just to find where the top the bottom of my character or where does the body ends.	O
It's like that.	O
This is kind of the top of his hair.	O
Talking with body.	O
On the body.	O
And then we'll probably need to make the leg a little bit bigger.	O
Just here, he's got both of his legs bent, so I'm going to drop that a little.	O
Awesome Nicholas, your first follow on be heads.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for following.	CHITCHAT
All right, so the other thing that I want to do, I'm going to keep this little guy is a reference here.	O
But I'm going to make a copy of him and bring this up here.	O
Because I'm going to eventually make this one just a black-and-white reference.	O
Alright cool so for that black-and-white reference I'll just set my outline.	O
To block another, Phil.	O
Beach white OK cool, so the first thing that I'm going to do now it is work on the front view of this little guy.	O
So I'm going to ungroup this original image and really, I think the main thing that I'm going to want.	O

You get rid of her.	O
Fix the top here.	O
Get rid of the shading.	O
So is this going out of the way?	O
Remove the shading from the peak.	O
Get rid of the other wing.	O
Conservative shading area.	O
All right, so the other thing that we had to do.	O
It's just mark off.	O
Where the peak is.	O
Now I'm using, this is drawn lines instead of guidelines in the app that are built in rather from the rulers in illustrator because I want to print these out.	O
And have them be viewable.	O
In the final piece so.	O
Best way to do that is just to draw them.	O
I can select those endpoints as well just to get them even.	O
Is that matters and to me for some reason it does.	O
Don't worry about that right now.	CHITCHAT
Go.	CHITCHAT
So we're just going to drop him backwards a little bit.	O
Soon back in.	O
Just going to get rid of the rest of the highlights.	O
Get rid of this little light spots in the eyes.	O
Actually just drop this week.	O
I'm down.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make these lines in lighter blue.	O
Just so they stand out a little bit from the black line.	O
Discovered the highlights on swing.	O
Alright cool, so I've got my eye shape here.	O
Looking like.	O
See if there's more than one circle here, 'cause it's acting like there is.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Is the line for his eye drop the guy down just a little bit?	O
Nicholas is asking will you post the final work on Instagram?	CHITCHAT
Yes I will.	CHITCHAT
The final work will be both on Instagram and in behaves as well.	O
And I'll keep adding to that project as well as the animation for this little character gets underway.	O
So yeah, hopefully something will be posted tomorrow.	O
We'll See, and also as I don't know if I mentioned at the beginning of the screen, but this will also be evolving into a website based on a little trip in yellow.	O
And hopefully have some fun animation and some interactivity there.	O
OK, so there's a few things that I have to figure out based on this original sketch and.	O
One of those things is going to be what this character's beak is going to look like when viewed when viewed.	O
Head on, which are not going to get that same point.	O
I also want something that's going to be flexible enough to support.	O
Different expressions.	O
So there's a lot to figure out here.	O
Maybe before we do the be Kyle, Recreate the legs and for this I'm actually just going to delete the second leg will use this one as a reference for a moment.	O

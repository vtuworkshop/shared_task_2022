But I'm just going to take the pen tool.	O
And draw a straight line.	O
Down.	O
We will make that a little thicker.	O
Two thick Let's try.	O
That's probably about right.	O
OK, so I think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that should work.	CHITCHAT
So this will be the basis for his leg.	O
And then he's going to have.	O
His little foot here.	O
So I'm actually going to bring this up just a little bit.	O
Make a copy of this one.	O
What I want to do now is just going to just get a feel for.	O
How's the foot might look?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
The trouble I'm here just to connect it.	O
You know, rotate it.	O
And just think about how.	O
How to put my look when it's when you're viewing him head on?	O
I think they probably just going to display out to the sides.	O
You can make it like just a little bit skinnier.	O
Maybe something more like?	O
Something like that.	O
Just his little.	O
Quatto's not sure which problems.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Little leg is going to be about pixels wide and actually for now.	O
Just going to.	O
Outline that stroke.	O
Oh yeah, Nicholas.	CHITCHAT
Actually that's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
So Nicholas hides the suggestion to maybe just try duplicating that left leg and.	O
Having it be like that on both sides so his legs are never quite.	O
Straight, which actually might work a lot better than what I'm doing now.	O
So let me join this one up real quick and then will try that.	O
'cause I think you're right.	O
I think he's going to want.	O
I'm not sure his leg should ever be the straight.	O
Cool, so yes, let's do two and we can compare them.	O
Use this one this one.	O
Personally.	CHITCHAT
And back.	O
And then let's take this guideline leg.	O
Over.	CHITCHAT
Over.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
It's actually maybe we can have both.	O
He can hit this could just be a different pose.	O
So there's like a difference between.	O
Kind of being crouched down a little bit and standing straight.	O
That could probably work.	O
'cause Yeah, I looked at two.	O
I think the straight can work.	O
He needs need to curb these corners in a little.	O
Grab that rounding tool.	O
Bring them in slightly.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT

Put this bottom guideline for his heel boots seeds.	O
That's not what I meant.	O
Get that about words.	O
He was.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so this group this.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to also.	O
Gridlock that.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now I'm going to select this whole character and grab my line tool center at all.	O
Great, so he's nice and straight within the same thing.	O
With this Ice facing about the same.	O
That's right group.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
The centre everything.	O
And move them over for a minute.	O
Nicholas asks, is it necessary to go to go to the psychologist because he fell in love with an illustration?	O
Wow, that might call for psychiatry.	O
I mean.	CHITCHAT
As long as both you in this character OK with it, I guess it's fine.	O
Alright, so I was thinking, oh I also, let's do a little more thing.	O
Will select these characters, cut them.	O
I've been a lock this one.	O
Let's put this on a layer above the guides.	O
Yes, like that.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I think that's going to work.	CHITCHAT
The other thing that I'm going to do now is just reduce the opacity of these lines.	O
Now we can work with them a little easier.	O
Let's lock that layer.	O
And this would be the general there.	O
Nicholas, you are so kind.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is looking pretty good for the front front view of chicken yellow.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I want to going to keep the beak for now super super simple so that.	O
In this next half after we finished the turn around, we can work on some.	O
Up Some different expressions and really get a better feel for how the beak.	O
Is going to look.	O
I do want to bring a little highlights back.	O
Scrap this thread size.	O
Scrap the colour so no.	O
Psalms bottom layer.	O
God.	CHITCHAT
There you are.	CHITCHAT
Take it off this one.	O
Let's lock that one so we can't do that again.	O
The other highlight here.	O
So I'm actually going to move this crouching version over for now, and I think this is a good start for the.	O
For the front view, and then the next thing to do will be the side view.	O
And you'll see that for the rest of this, once you've created that initial front view, creating the other piece is actually really easy.	O

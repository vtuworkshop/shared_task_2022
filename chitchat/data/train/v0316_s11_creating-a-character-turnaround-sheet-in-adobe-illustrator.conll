Not expressions though.	O
Haha, here we go.	CHITCHAT
All right, So what we're going to do now?	O
This is, uh.	CHITCHAT
Send an older character that I worked on.	O
This is a character.	O
Looks a lot like an Adventure Time character actually, but one of the really fun things to do, and so you can see the turnarounds that I made here for that character.	O
The thing I like to do next is start to play with expressions and.	O
So here you can see all these different expressions and it's a great way to start to get a feel for how the character is going to move.	O
What sorts of boundaries?	O
Maybe there are with the character that you define.	O
Maybe you figure out that, like oh, geez, you know.	O
Eyebrows will actually help add a lot of expression here, and so you can see that while my character in a neutral pose up at the top has no eyebrows when she is angry, she has eyebrows when she's kind of evil or devious looking.	O
She has eyebrows.	O
If she's scared she does.	O
So you can start to get an idea again for when animated.	O
How this character is going to behave?	O
What are they actually going to do?	O
And so I'm going to do a similar exercise with chicken yellow.	O
To start to get a feel for and actually we're going to do it without these highlights.	O
'cause these highlights are freaking me out.	O
He looks scary.	CHITCHAT
Be gone, I like to be gone.	O
Bring you back later.	O
Why does it bother me so much?	CHITCHAT
OK, so I don't need to worry about his legs so much, but I do want to keep his little plume here, so I'm going to copy this face.	O
Oh, I suppose we could also.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's work on it.	CHITCHAT
Head on 1st and then I can always do some more more expression work without.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
What's up?	CHITCHAT
Let's get rid of the legs.	O
Yes, Nicholas, that's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
Make chicken yellow scared with his wings covering his face, his legs almost spread like his legs crossed.	O
Yes, I love that and that will come so after I've done some of these expressions.	O
I can also share.	CHITCHAT
Let me grab that other character design.	O
So one of the things that you want to do when you're starting to think about a calla character will move is too.	O
Think about poses and expressions and so when I was working out my.	O
This little girl character Rather than.	O
Manipulating her in this complex state with all of the clothing in the styling.	O
The easiest way to start thinking about position and.	O
Full body poses with expressions is to 1st just block them out and so you get a feel for what basic geometric shapes make up my character.	O
In the case of chicken yellow, that's going to be really easy 'cause it's basically going to be a circle and some rectangles for the legs, but you start to block those out and it gives you really simple toolkit for playing around with different poses.	O
And so I took these closes and then those became.	O
Posts like this.	O
And so I'll go through a similar exercise.	O
I probably won't get to that tonight, but I will go through that exercise with.	O
With chicken yellow as well, but the first thing I want to do again is just play around with some expression.	O
Start thinking about how good his beak might move and and shape.	O

Last night I ended up.	CHITCHAT
Last night I ended up watching the new Adventure Time special on HBO Max.	CHITCHAT
The new distant land special with fimo and.	CHITCHAT
I decided that I had to work with a cute character.	O
So we're working on chicken yellow.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah Nicholas, that's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
Let's give him a little tongue.	O
3 little tongue.	O
Kind of tweak this year slightly alright.	O
So to create that I'm just going to use the ellipse tool.	O
A little smaller.	O
And then I will jump out of this real quick.	O
I'm just going to select all these.	O
She's like a second lection.	O
Just make sure everything is in the middle.	O
Then I'll make a copy of.	O
Smile.	O
He grabbed that tongue.	O
And then using the Pathfinder intersect shape mode we get the little.	O
Little bug first tongue.	O
Mommy, this is also a cool headgear.	O
Yes, that's a great idea.	O
Alright, so there is one basic expression.	O
A simple one to build off that could be.	O
Up We just take this.	O
Just take the whole thing.	O
Go back.	O
Grab this.	O
Rotate it.	O
Oh, now looks like his little tooth.	O
Bluetooth.	O
An intersection there too.	O
We want to.	O
Up just slightly.	O
I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I'm not taking this much.	O
Open it up a little.	O
So another option was just tried.	O
This is a variation would actually be to allow the entire bee to move.	O
It's to fill it did I took that tongue and dropped it down or it turned into a tooth when we flipped it.	O
So another thing.	CHITCHAT
Another thing that I could do would be to.	O
Allows its beak to move a little bit groups.	O
So sort of like your cheeks, like when he smiles.	O
His beak could stretch little.	O
Feels maybe a little more little more organic that way, so this can be his regular basic shape, and then when he smiles and then I think actually it would make this.	O
Would make this one look a little better.	O
When he is scared or sad.	O
This is to be more of that scattered.	O
So here for this one, what I might do is.	O

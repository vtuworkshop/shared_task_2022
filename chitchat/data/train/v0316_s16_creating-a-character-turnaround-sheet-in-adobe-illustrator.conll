Round 2.	O
This curve a little bit.	O
Then you could have like one thing is he could like his beat, could just have like a little.	O
Or you could have like a little.	O
Opening It's over here.	O
Open.	CHITCHAT
Alright, checking out the chat again mouth open.	O
Yeah, I think.	CHITCHAT
I think something like that, and then Stewart Stewart.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the chat.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for thanks for joining in.	CHITCHAT
Stuart is asking are you going to apply all of these expressions to the turn around looks, so I probably won't.	CHITCHAT
I'll keep them as references.	CHITCHAT
What I'm going to do, we just group this one before I ruin it, so I want to get some example expressions.	O
And once I've created some, a few more expressions.	O
I will start to do some poses and so again I'll start it out by blocking as I did with this other character.	O
Just creating some blocked out poses and then.	O
All we find where they are here.	O
So after I've created those blocked out versions, I'll use those as references to create actual character poses and then I'll take some of these expressions and apply those expressions to those dynamic poses.	O
I don't need to get everything laid out in the turn around the turn around just helps as a tool as I start to move into animation to know how this character is going to look as he's moving around in the world that you need.	O
Inhabits, so just looking at the time here we've got about half an hour left, so I don't know if I'll get that far tonight.	O
But because I do want to apply some color and make a little color reference, but I will be back tomorrow.	O
I think I'll probably be working on this project tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to get a basic animation done and brought into a website that I'm working on, but that will be a little bit earlier in the day.	CHITCHAT
I'll be posting that schedule both here on the hands as well as on Twitter and Instagram, but I will be signing off from this stream at 9:00 PM eastern, which is in about 30 minutes so.	CHITCHAT
We'll see how far we can get.	CHITCHAT
I do want to get some more expressions.	CHITCHAT
Kind of mapped out.	CHITCHAT
Before we wrap up.	CHITCHAT
So another expression would be so we have kind of a sad.	O
We could make a really angry.	O
Uh, a really angry face.	O
So let's zoom in here.	O
Nicholas, do it.	CHITCHAT
Nicholas in the chat is saying I'll try to make a human side that would be awesome.	CHITCHAT
I encourage you to that if you do it, post it on be hands or Instagram and let me see it.	CHITCHAT
I want to see the design should come up with.	O
'cause that's what this is all about.	O
You know if you are inspired to do something, you should do it and share it with people.	O
It's a great way to.	CHITCHAT
Great way to grow and to learn more about what you do.	O
But yes, I'll be back.	CHITCHAT
I stream usually three or four nights a week.	CHITCHAT
I post my schedule again on Instagram, Twitter and behaves.	CHITCHAT

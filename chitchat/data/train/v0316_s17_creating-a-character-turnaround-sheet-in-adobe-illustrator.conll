Speak now.	CHITCHAT
And so he's going to have this.	O
Kind of grid.	O
So.	O
And here I might actually even introduce some tea.	O
Great thanks for following on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I will follow you back and be looking out to see some work.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is just looks.	O
He looks kind of sick like he's ill.	O
I kind of like the other half better, so I'm actually going to delete.	O
This side.	O
Just like that.	O
And then only copy of it.	O
And flip it horizontally.	O
It's like.	O
Little overlap going on, but that's OK.	O
Snap.	CHITCHAT
Point Right, so I'm going to take.	O
These two shapes.	O
And China.	O
And then I'm just going to drop.	O
This back a little bit.	O
But this one back a little bit.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And then.	O
What's that again that joined?	O
Like we got a little bit of.	O
Duplicate point.	O
Action zone on.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
And I think what I want now he still looks scared.	O
Come back here.	CHITCHAT
Make.	O
This piece And.	O
Thanks for checking up the Instagram so this character is a little bit different than most of the work that I do.	O
I tend to do really geometric.	O
$1 style pieces.	O
But this may also be I've been doing a lot of 3D lately.	O
This one could be a fun 12.	O
Recreating TV.	O
All right, so the other thing.	O
In this one.	O
Thank you very much Nicholas.	O
Yeah, I've this has been.	O
This is a pretty difficult time for me.	O
Personally, and one thing that I'm I'm really thankful for is that I can spend time creating.	O
It's it's a really wonderful way to heal it away so.	O
Just trying to get this mouth.	O
Hum or even drag this point.	O
That's better.	CHITCHAT
Right now I'm going to.	O
Draw in.	O
These two shapes.	O
And this.	O
Connect is here.	O
This all right now I'm going to copy of this mouth.	O
Going to grab the intersection.	O
These two shapes.	O
Who are grounds?	O
All of those corners?	O
Just so there's nothing sticking out?	O
Group it.	O
Yeah Nicholas, that's a great idea I think.	O
If you want to spend a lot of time working on your art and sharing that with people, sometimes it's nice to have a separate.	O
A separate Instagram that you can.	O
Where you can be kind of purely focused on just art right now.	O
Mine is a little bit of both and I too may end up.	O
Setting up a personal one In addition.	O

Alright, so I'm going to flip this eyebrow over.	O
So now he's mad.	O
Not just a little bit mad alot mad.	O
Screw these eyebrows.	O
And then like I did before, I'm actually going to drop this beat down slightly.	O
Bring out just a touch.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And then maybe even just add a little more detail.	O
Maybe even put like.	O
Little bit of increase around the size for but cap on that.	O
Finally.	O
And group this one.	O
Yeah, sure.	CHITCHAT
Smell.	O
All right, now we've gotten angry.	O
Every guy Another way to augment the character is also to use his eyes and change them a little bit.	O
So while his eyes are going to primarily just be these circles, there could also be instances where, let's say he's smiling.	O
Actually, let's not use this one.	O
Scrap the smile.	O
And instead of this.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Stuart says thank you for the answer.	CHITCHAT
I've been working on a character of a cat recently and this is very helpful.	CHITCHAT
Great, I'm glad I'm really glad that that's helpful.	CHITCHAT
Stewart, the I started doing character reference is only in the last.	O
You're so I took a character design course and they had us do it there and kind of showed us how to use them.	O
But something that is really fun, Stewart if you Google like Adventure Time character sheets or just any of your favorite cartoons, search for character sheet.	O
You'll find all sorts of references for how to create these.	O
One of my other favorite shows outside of Adventure Time is bravest Warriors and their character sheets are all online and they can be really helpful to just to help you work out like what.	O
What is this character look like?	O
Because if you can solve these problems in this form, whether you're working on like a comic book.	O
Or if you're working on actual animation, you've got this reference now that you can use to build that character in all of those different ways.	O
Nicholas says, I'm going to eat dinner now.	CHITCHAT

Great to hang out with you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for all the ideas and the feedback is I've been working and I hope to see you see you again.	CHITCHAT
Um, I'm going to keep working on this overly happy version of this character character.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And he now is going to have.	O
Let's just delete this bottom point.	O
Right here.	O
No, not the whole life.	O
Autumn point.	O
Come on, there we go, so will do the same thing here.	O
So and as I did before, I just want to.	O
Fix this.	O
And I'm gonna just curve it so maybe the eyes will go like this.	O

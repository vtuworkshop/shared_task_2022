The master classes held in.	CHITCHAT
In Berlin.	CHITCHAT
And in 19 or 19 in 2019.	CHITCHAT
What's great about it is that you get to travel to Berlin for eight days and work with a group of usually 30 to 40 other designers of all sorts.	CHITCHAT
Some are some working games, some are illustrate children's books.	CHITCHAT
Others, like myself, are just like people who are passionate about character design.	CHITCHAT
But you get to go to all sorts of lectures.	CHITCHAT
You do workshops and really get a chance to develop your characters.	CHITCHAT
You also get some online mentoring from the.	CHITCHAT
From the faculty and then the following year you get to actually show your work at at the Pixel Plasma Conference in Berlin.	CHITCHAT
And so I got to go back the following year.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I guess I went to pick to Pleasanton 2018 and then got to show my piece of work that I created at picked a plasma conference in in 2019.	CHITCHAT
The two professors for the course who teach you are real Alexander and Nathan Jura vicious who are amazing, amazing artists and designers and really sweet sweet people.	CHITCHAT
And the the the course is just great if you have the opportunity in the means to do this, I highly recommend it.	CHITCHAT
Obviously with Covid and all of the travel restrictions we have right now, there's probably some delay on these courses, but there are other great places to another great character design.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
School our class that you can take.	CHITCHAT
Let me find a link for it here.	CHITCHAT
If you're interested also in animation and want to learn more about character design, then there is a.	CHITCHAT
Incredible animator close this.	CHITCHAT
There's an incredible animator named Marcus Magnuson.	CHITCHAT
Who has this course which is at motion design school and the character that I've been showing during this stream.	CHITCHAT
This little, this girl and these techniques of doing a character turn around positions poses all of these things were techniques as well.	CHITCHAT
That Marcus goes over in his course.	CHITCHAT
So this two is a little pricey.	CHITCHAT
It's 419 American dollars.	CHITCHAT
But this is an amazing course.	CHITCHAT
Marcus is a really funny and great teacher and this is all online, so you can do this at anytime and this gets you into animation.	CHITCHAT
Moving from illustrator into after effects.	CHITCHAT
How to use different plugins to make it easy to animate limbs and things like that.	CHITCHAT
So this is another course that is that is really great and I recommend it.	CHITCHAT
But you can also find great resources online.	CHITCHAT
This is some of the of Marcus is work.	CHITCHAT
This is one of the coolest animations I think ever.	CHITCHAT
I love that so much.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, but again picked a plasma is incredible.	CHITCHAT
I recommend it very, very highly if you have the opportunity to do it.	CHITCHAT
I would go back and do it again if I could.	CHITCHAT
It's just a great group.	CHITCHAT
Really wonderful people.	CHITCHAT
Oh, here's a bird character I was looking at a little earlier from a show called blazing beaks.	CHITCHAT
Just to get some some inspiration.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So I've got my little sleeping character here.	CHITCHAT
Just zoom out.	CHITCHAT
And take a look at our character sheet.	CHITCHAT
So we started off at the beginning of the stream with this character sketch that I had done of my little character named chicken yellow, who is an egg yolk.	CHITCHAT
Who has come to life is kind of like half bird, half eggs.	CHITCHAT
I guess you never fully never fully formed.	CHITCHAT
And what we did today was create a character reference sheet, or at least the beginnings of it.	CHITCHAT
And this is comprised of some information about the character turnarounds.	CHITCHAT
Some expressions tomorrow I will likely do a couple of dynamic poses, but I do want to play with some animation, so I may jump into after effects and do some simple animation there just so that I can get to work on the website project that I have tide into this.	CHITCHAT
But we are.	CHITCHAT
At the end of the stream for tonight's time, so I appreciate you all for turning it in, tuning in and hanging out with me as we've worked on our character turnarounds.	CHITCHAT

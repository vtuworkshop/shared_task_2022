Green, the green, a little bit more.	O
Maybe this guy could be more blueish armor.	O
It's kind of cool.	O
Yeah, there are quite a few advantages to selections like this.	O
I think well, one speed when you're doing this, 'cause like.	O
And like how clean it is and how you can if you're not making selections 'cause you're painting one layer, then you also missing out on reselecting stuff later on.	O
'cause now I can just re select this whenever I want all the skin tones.	O
Um, or if I made like a whole shadow path, which I will do later.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
Then I can select all the shadows.	O
And then only edit the shadow area.	O
Very useful.	CHITCHAT
Or you boy.	CHITCHAT
You, Amy.	CHITCHAT
Hey, stay hydrated.	CHITCHAT
I want to give him OK.	CHITCHAT
Now it's time for like the secondary armored color.	O
Whoa, what's happening there?	CHITCHAT
Hey.	CHITCHAT
Stop that.	CHITCHAT
I think I want to make these negative spaces too.	O
Oh yes, look at that value thing.	O
So yeah, I was saying you can change color right without changing value and that's bad.	O
We don't want to do that.	O
Why do I want that to be gaps?	O
I think that's a little bit too noisy there.	O
If it's gap, so we'll keep it.	O
But you can see in black-and-white.	O
When I edited those colors.	O
We're getting slightly different values as well.	O
So what does that mean so?	CHITCHAT
Instead of everything being just one tone like this.	O
Why is that?	CHITCHAT
I'll cut down with that on the same layer, isn't it?	O
OK, 1 second Yeah.	CHITCHAT
But basically instead of getting just one tone.	O
Of value.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
With Sunday at different variations of Gray in here from introducing skin tones and some of the highlight metal.	O
And I'm going to do even more of this to make it look more interesting.	O
It's Pizza man who's Pizza Man?	O
Yeah this guys your friendly slice of Pizza he wants.	O
He wants to take the first bite.	O
Masquerade vibes with the bird looking mask.	O
Hell yeah.	CHITCHAT
Kanichi konnichiwa hey.	CHITCHAT
That's not the right war.	O
That's why, but that's not the right one, so you don't actually speak Japanese.	O
You can't fool me.	O
If you want to write konnichiwa like that, you actually have to put her at the end up instead of war.	O
Did you know that?	O
I don't think so.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
I want this out the face to pop right?	O
So what I've got so far?	O
The colors are very complementary in terms of the armor, so if I want to make this part pop.	O
Then it's gotta.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be something orange like.	O
So I might go 'cause I want to contrast against the properly properly blue.	O
So maybe somewhere like here will make it really pop pop.	O
Dang pop up.	CHITCHAT
I don't want that one maybe.	O
Well, that's kind of interesting.	O
Pretty interesting so it too bright for me, though we are working in shadows for now.	O
Maybe they should make it pop that much either too, like.	O
Not compete with and have too many Hughes.	O
Then Well, maybe I need to turn down the green.	O
Are there we go?	CHITCHAT
I think that was the Hue I was looking for.	O
No doubt I wanted, though that's all good man.	O
Pick up that dual lingo and you'll get there.	O
I actually did do a lingo for I checked out Duolingo's Japanese course.	O

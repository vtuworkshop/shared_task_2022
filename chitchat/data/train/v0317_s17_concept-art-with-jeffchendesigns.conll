Let's look if I've been waiting to do this for like awhile 'cause the Workflow I had with line work didn't really allow it.	O
So I wanted to bring this leg out.	O
And I want to, I think.	O
Like laying the body more forward slightly.	O
Kay?	CHITCHAT
I have references for how I wanted to do parenting on the cloth as well, so we might look into that right now.	O
I want to get old that up to like proper detail before I go into.	O
More rendering was my reference board.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Primal Tech There it is.	O
I hope me loading things they didn't like.	CHITCHAT
Like the stream alot.	CHITCHAT
Probably did the.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm done with the screen.	O
Another screen.	O
So flight.	O
Hard light.	O

How do we sign up for houses on discord?	O
I can't write anything on the House.	O
Sign up.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you have to get so there's a challenge board.	O
You have to do one of those challenges.	O
First will assign you.	O
A Chunky Warrior Walt role, so that's for basically all the sort of challenge events in the future.	O
And then, if that's like the house parts optional.	O
So once you get the Chunky Warrior Roll, you can.	O
Sign up for house.	O
Let's have a look on there.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you know what?	CHITCHAT
Let me guide you through this place.	O
So if you go up to here, just take on one of these challenges, yeah?	O
And then you submit it to chunky Gallery.	O
You see other people.	O
Actually this is all like our recent challenge, but here's one.	O
He's one of the submissions from the Chunky Challenge Board.	O
Once you get that, then you can go into house, sign up and get a house.	O
Could Steve join discord?	CHITCHAT
Looking forward to speaking to you there.	CHITCHAT
No problem.	CHITCHAT
Actually hate doing cloth patterns, by the way.	O
2nd is the most annoying things for me.	O
Much is like I really feel like just taking some pattern off.	O

They really like playing mystery mode, just going rando.	O
That's fun.	CHITCHAT
But I think yeah, I'm touched there watching ages.	O
Probably more than a year.	O
Same as League, I think.	O
The last time I played League.	O
I tried it like a few people in this code.	O
That that was like.	O
Another thing that was last year, was it.	O
I just have to think about where I was living, 'cause like that's like the easiest way for me to tell what year something was.	O
'cause I move every year.	O
Where was, I think is back in Melbourne still so probably last year, early last year or the year before.	O
Oh yeah, that's what I want to do.	O
I'm going to overlay.	O
And get some nice juicy.	O
Saturation in here.	O
Yeah, this is what I need.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
And they're both with my friends.	O
Yeah, right?	CHITCHAT
I remember like I was doing some ranked matches in Overwatch.	O
And this guy is just so toxic.	O
It's like saying everyone's trash.	O
Hello like.	CHITCHAT
Well, for me at least I think game should be fun and relaxing.	O
I don't see the point in just being angry all the time, like like I know you care about a game and like your rank but like.	O
If that's going to make you be in a bad mood for the rest of the day, what's the point?	O
More of a single player story guy these days.	O
Yes, I.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I can't put in that much time for multiplayer games.	O
The only like multiplayer game I play now smash.	O
'cause I can't hear what the opponent saying.	O
But I hate when people teabag actually gets me so easy.	O
Easily triggered.	O
Luckily, like as you climb the ladder in smash, it doesn't happen as often people don't teabag.	O
Then if you want to trigger me.	O
Just just teabag me.	O
Select the balance on this canvas is.	O
Really annoying me.	CHITCHAT
Open that up.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Feels better.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but yeah, teabagging teabags, my curse.	O
When it's for friends it's OK 'cause I can hear them giggle and it feels funny.	O
But like online, It's like if they do something like if I like kill myself facts and then they they teabag just like what did you do?	O
Why you popping off like you didn't do anything?	O
I feel so good when like.	CHITCHAT
If they teabag and then I get to kill off the Woods, I think that's the best feeling.	CHITCHAT
Like when you win when you beat a teabagger.	O
It's better than just the normal wind.	O
I think that's like.	O

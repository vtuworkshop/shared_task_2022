I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna put this.	O
In this group with torso.	O
So most here another party can begin.	O
How's it going now?	CHITCHAT
How's it?	CHITCHAT
How's your super secret project going?	CHITCHAT
OK come get Quicken start here.	O
I'm just showing everybody that I've got all of this stuff broken up into separate layers and named which is going to be super helpful when we export this app to animate.	O
I'll be able to target these specific groups.	O
Let's if I back up here we go all the way back in time to where we started.	O
Here's our sketches that we started with God, I hate that astronauts sketches.	O
Just I didn't turn out the sketch was bad.	O
But the Astra Orion turned out very nice butt.	O
We started there and we kind of went over them illustrator.	O
I believe we talked about this before 'cause some people had asked when I do these sketches I just use.	O
It's worth pronounce it.	O
Calligraphic brush with just the pressure sensitivity.	O
Settings.	CHITCHAT
Here I've had such pressure sensitivity because I've got my centriq.	O
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna ask here.	CHITCHAT
Lego my network.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
No, it's not gonna work today that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I have a a overhead camera is not responding so.	O
Now I will show you that, but you can see I've got my pressure sensitivity on this brush here this weekend.	O
Looks like it's got a little thing that as you push down on pen tip it responds to pressure on screen.	O
So that's why I use just a sketch in illustrator.	O
So I'm actually early sketch later 'cause we don't actually want them for animating.	O
Will just causes.	O
Some grief when we tried to animate, so I'm going to leave all that.	O
If you look in here.	O
We got all of our stars name.	O
That's gonna help us.	O
Without lines.	O
Scorpion cleaning some stuff up.	O
Before we exports, you animate and you guys can tell me how you're going, how it's going in the chat with you guys and up to this weekend.	O
Say.	CHITCHAT
Why I'm just a setting all except for exporting as an SVG, so I think we're probably going to start there unless you guys.	O
How many objections ever?	O
I don't wanna start with us today, so now saying it is super secret.	O
So secret that I already uploaded just cleaning logos for fun.	O
Did you let an cringles you upload your being here for a cold?	O
Notification Oh, they are.	O
OK, yeah, I'll drag it over here, baby girl, there's no there's not be handsome hello which is full screen for no apparent reason I'll check it out now.	O
Oh, I like the mask.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it looks great.	CHITCHAT

Look scared, Crinkle man.	O
I like the texture that you added to these.	O
It's really nice go to.	CHITCHAT
I like the colors that are you like.	O
The colors for each of the flavors in the detection.	O
The bathroom counter reminds me like the flavor powder that is on the Pringles.	O
Yeah, this looks great.	O
I would like it would be cool to see these like Pringles locked up on the actual Pringle cans.	O
That would be fine I think.	CHITCHAT
Nice now.	CHITCHAT
Give me some light.	O

Everybody go give mile follow not great work.	CHITCHAT

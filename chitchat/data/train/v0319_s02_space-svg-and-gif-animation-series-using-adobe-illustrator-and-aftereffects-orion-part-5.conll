Oh my gosh, why just?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Hey, fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
My marches in the chat too.	CHITCHAT
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
Ray Marsh.	CHITCHAT
I think our TV is saying I'm not trying.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to learn know VHDL like watching network for flying.	CHITCHAT
Very cool, uh, we're not working in X DJ were working in uh.	CHITCHAT
Illustrator actually going to be working in mostly after effects and handwriting some SSO CSS.	O
Once we export this out so.	O
As I go through here, make sure I've got everything crossed.	O
Setup called once be.	O
Well, export unless you worry about the space layer because it's going to not be animating.	O
Ryan He got all this stuff that I wanted to hear.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna see what happens when I export this.	O
I might need to go through and clean up some lines.	O
This line work exports how I want it to make sense.	O
No, thank you.	CHITCHAT
It's not easy to get better doing.	CHITCHAT
Nods and stuff, but I feel like I'm upgrading My Portfolio little by little.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's great.	CHITCHAT
I think you're doing right.	CHITCHAT
Per say.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna export this out as an.	O
Sushi in equities.	O
Getting started.	CHITCHAT
Nice to see you.	CHITCHAT
Bigger TV says now you're creative and talented.	CHITCHAT
Of course.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, of course.	CHITCHAT
I believe.	CHITCHAT
I want use for an export this out.	O
Nope, that's not it.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
I will say that.	O
Save as SVG.	O
File here.	O
Uh micro through he's settings.	O
UM, if you want there.	O
Just some technical from information.	O
The SVD version we're exporting too.	O
Do I have any plans we don't really worry about that we don't have any raster art so we don't worry about this too much.	O
Um, I'm using silence because I want to export file tags, uhm?	O
I don't want to include unused rap styles on exporting it out to 2 decimal places.	O
You can increase the decimal places and it will that basically just it's rounding up.	O
To the nearest decimal place 2 decimal places.	O
That makes sense.	O
So you can increase that value and your points will be more accurately placed instead of rounding but we don't really need to worry about that.	O
It makes your files really large enlargement you increase that decimal place, so we're not going to mess with that.	O
Had to be responsive, so yeah, you can even get a little preview of your SVG code near.	O
Give you a little like text window to show you what everything looks like.	O
And I know that I'm probably going to have the same issue I always have with the clipping mask.	O
Will try to see if I can remember how I could set the last time so.	O
Nothing.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much Sir.	CHITCHAT
In August last year I learned illustrated by myself.	CHITCHAT
That's why it looks so simple.	CHITCHAT
Looks great now.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't have to be complicated too.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
It can be simple.	CHITCHAT
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
In fact, I think that logo should probably should be pretty simple because you want to make sure that they hold up that you know variety of sizes.	O
So think art TV says I still like it any learn quickly.	O
That's so cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's pretty fast, so you pick up illustrator, Nick saying a Jack everything looks so out of this world?	O
Yeah?	CHITCHAT
Uh, I stepped away for separate soon specify that use the embedded CSS option with export.	O
Why does not sound familiar to me?	O
I'm just look and see what color is something that you don't get that.	O
In here.	O
Specify the easy embed CSS option.	O

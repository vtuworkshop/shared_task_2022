I know there's things I have to that attach the styles to your paths in.	O
Ask G so I know that much.	O
But yeah, we want to use a stylus.	O
For our purposes today so.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Open this up in line for saying inline CSS is what you just showed, which would be harder to use.	O
Yes, because you don't.	O
Everything is like the styles are on each path.	O

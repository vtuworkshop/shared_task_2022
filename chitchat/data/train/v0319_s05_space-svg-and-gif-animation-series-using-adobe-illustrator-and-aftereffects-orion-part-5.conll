Ryan Murphy saying all the code looks proper confusing.	CHITCHAT
It's really not bad.	CHITCHAT
Um, honestly, I kind of talked about this before.	CHITCHAT
I'm not a developer and I can sort of.	CHITCHAT
Work my way, kind of through all of this, uhm?	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
File this animation every day.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit more complex than the other ones that we've done.	CHITCHAT
We're certainly animating more stuff, which is why I'm definitely saying like we're not going to get through all of this.	O
Today, but you can see here that I'm basically just targeting these names here that are the names of the groups from illustrator.	O
So if you just remember to keep all your file organizing like group and name, the things that you want to animate, you can apply the animations essentially to those groups.	O
If I Scroll down so all of this stuff you see here, that's like dot St, whatever those are the styles and those styles.	O
Basically they define the style of the paths that are below here, so you'll see in each one of these that would be like a color associated with it.	O
In this case, this is am a clipping mask.	O
But you'll see here like this style is saying like this is the fill color in it applies it to these paths down below here.	O
So if you Scroll down.	O
You'll see down here that the Stars Group has the class St one applied to it, and this down here the path class.	O
Basically you can think about this as a coordinate Mac for your paths out of illustrator, so you all of these, these numbers and everything they need to know what they do, but it basically it's the coordinates for your paths in illustrator and not just the path like you know, on a static grid.	O
So like you know when you're playing battleship like 0102, right?	O
Like an X&Y and.	O
Agreed, but it also.	O
It also, uh.	CHITCHAT
Has You'll see like some math in here like this this point line at this point, and things like that because it's also.	O
It also is a coordinate that like it because it's responsive, it has the points also in relation to the other points next to it, if that makes sense.	O
I don't need to explain this right but.	O
The parts, not just of coordinate grid, that's a coordinate grid of points in relation to other points to flying the shape.	O
So there we go.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I think it's useful to at least look at SVG files just so that you.	O
I think it's helpful to understand just for yourself what illustrator is doing.	O
Sort of under the hood.	O
This gives you a good idea of like.	O
You know we talk all the time about how illustrator is using.	O
Is is drawing shapes right?	O
But it's this really helps you understand like understand that unlike a different level.	O
What what that means?	CHITCHAT
So well to coordinate?	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Steven.	CHITCHAT
Nice to see you my friend.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's a It's a coordinate grid but also the the points are like relative to each other.	O
So basically it's it's pretty simple if you when you think about it, it's literally supplying styles too.	O
These points.	O
And I can change this on the fly, which is something that's really cool.	O
So, um.	CHITCHAT
On the website, for example.	O
You can change.	O
If using, ask Jeeves.	O
Theoretically, you could change the colors on the fly on the site with within the site, yet I don't know it's good you do a lot of cool stuff with that.	O
With the stuff I feel like we talked for a long time, uhm?	O
Everybody wants the tacos, so I think we need to make that happen.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Mouse saying If I did thanks, I did the job one from scratch.	O
20 very cool.	O
Yeah I thought the July 1 would be from scratch 'cause it looked very much like it was.	O
So now is in in favor of the Taco app.	O
Look, I saying applying yesterday closed my first UI speed art on Instagram.	O
Wow that is so cool.	CHITCHAT
Sharing the chat.	CHITCHAT
Share link to your uh your Instagram and will take a look at it.	CHITCHAT
Thursday hello tacos, tacos.	CHITCHAT
Yes, seriously, we need to, uh.	CHITCHAT

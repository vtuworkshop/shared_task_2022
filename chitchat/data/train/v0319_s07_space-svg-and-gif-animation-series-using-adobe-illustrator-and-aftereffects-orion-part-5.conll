I think it is like a happy dance.	CHITCHAT
It's now it's still here remembers me getting very excited about the.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Is there?	CHITCHAT
Who won?	CHITCHAT
So I need to.	O
Basically do the same thing again, but this time we're going to do the.	O
That's a shield over here or hide.	O
But you can talk about last time and I'm going to guess that this is going to be the same situation, yeah?	O
What?	CHITCHAT
So I need to increase the size of this quite a bit.	O
Thus why was longer?	O
You might be too much.	O
Play.	O
Maybe you should just the 1:50.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
I promise you that the next portions of this are going to be a little more clear.	O
Because this part in little bit.	O
Weird.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Try to explain to you what is happening here.	O
Think of this as.	O
So this is all of the information.	O
Uh, be giving it to say like this is the line I want you to to come.	O
Target to animate the stroke, dasheri and stroke offset ISM.	O
Making the dash line in this case I'm I'm making the dash is so large that thing essentially are.	O
Not visible in the animate on, so they are visible.	O
This is the animation duration of giving it a name, so I'm saying that your timeline is going to be 8 seconds.	O
The animation name Line 0 one drive.	O
Animation timing function.	O
This means that it goes.	O
Disney.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't repeat.	O
No, Anderson iteration count means it's repeating infinitely.	O
If I change this to what it would only animate once?	O
Animation film mode means it's going backwards and forwards.	O
Oh, animation timing function is the easing essentially, so I could change this to ease in.	O
And it would.	O
He said.	CHITCHAT
We don't want any using on this.	O
We wanted to animate.	O
Oh So look at asking, uh, where did you put to turn this SVG file into all of this code so I didn't actually click on anything.	O
Per say I have this code editor called Adam.	O
It's open source.	O
Order, but you can edit SVG files in any text editor if you just right click on the SVG year.	O
And and I can choose to open it with Adam or pretty much I can open it in like just a text editor and I can start editing things this way and save it, so I'm not.	O
This code, the SVG file, has all the code built into it already.	O
You just it's a matter of opening it in a text editor versus opening it as an image, and we kind of went over when I exported it out here.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Did not watch you.	O
I think I unfall Springdale strip slides not given media.	O
That's boring.	O
Window, obvious, where'd you go.	O
So maybe maybe.	CHITCHAT
No, my toolbar the top seemingly.	O

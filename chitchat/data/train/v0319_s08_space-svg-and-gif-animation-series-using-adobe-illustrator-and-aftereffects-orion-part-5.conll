Doesn't want to cooperate.	CHITCHAT
My exports are.	CHITCHAT
Hello no.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well normally I'd be able to get the drop down from illustrator up here.	O
But it does not want to give.	O
Look No.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy dragging it out from the top window up here and see if I can get it to Kodiak support.	O
Traveling is not want to give you a little, uh.	O
Like to live without you.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
That's fine, but you go to file export and save this as an SVG.	O
And yes, you open up.	O
Actually, if you think you can open up just straight illustrator files in text editor as well.	O
No you cannot, but I have accidentally and we talked about.	O
I think we talked about this in French cakes discord.	O
When you accidentally, you can actually copy and paste accidentally like illustrator content like I've accidentally like selected something in illustrator and copied.	O
And like was typing something or innotech doing something with text and hit paste thinking right?	O
Like copied Syntax Anet instead.	O
Like facing the contents of my illustrator file as text, but yeah.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Lego Luca.	O
That's how we did it.	O
Rheimar she saying he shined his boots up proper for his little space machine and it is.	O
Alright, where are we out here?	CHITCHAT
I'm just watching this anime through here to make sure they've got anything open I wanted to looks pretty good.	O
We're going to go with it for now, and I want to get into some other stuff, but.	O
If we look down here, I've got two things going on.	O
I've got this.	CHITCHAT
I'm targeting the line and giving it all these instructions about what it's supposed to be doing right and if we get on here, you see that animating the dash offset.	O
Which is basically like.	O
Position of the UM.	O
With a dash line.	O
Begins.	CHITCHAT
And Dasheri is the link up the dash I believe.	O
Don't quote me on that, but um, down here yet, key frames for these and these key frames are percentages of time, right?	O
So at 100% of 8 seconds this is where I want the dash all set to be so we can do the same thing with transform, which is what we're going to do with our little.	O
Spaceman, so next thing I'm going to do just because something I know that I want to do and I think it will be a little bit easier for you guys to understand is I want to animate.	O
So here the highlight on news helmet.	O
So open back up here.	O
I think I just have this name.	O
Check helmet highlights.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We'll see if that works may have to actually target the path inside of a group, but.	O
I don't want to, but I want some sexy.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
3 results.	O
Yeah alright hold highlight so I'm going to target this.	O
Hopefully it works I.	O
What happened to her?	CHITCHAT
Clip it there.	O
Oh so many things.	O
Sometimes things break.	O
Fact fact of life.	O
Alright, sorry too far in the 7 figure out what's happening by putting masks.	O
So what?	CHITCHAT
But what?	CHITCHAT

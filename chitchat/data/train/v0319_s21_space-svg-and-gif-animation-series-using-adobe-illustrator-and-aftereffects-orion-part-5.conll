Right now it's kind of disconnecting, so we have to make it as a group there to keep everything moving together.	CHITCHAT
Music will find that.	CHITCHAT
What's happening?	CHITCHAT
I know this word isn't here.	CHITCHAT
So we made.	CHITCHAT
You tether inside clipping mask group right here.	O
I'm actually gonna name that one one, which is probably going to break things, at least momentarily.	O
But I want to make.	CHITCHAT
Not the letter E have a new group and not that either.	O
My gosh, I don't know what that is.	CHITCHAT
OK here we go somehow like selected within a selection.	O
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
Stop asking your hands up too.	CHITCHAT
He asked the struggle is real, now saying Nope, no questions.	CHITCHAT
Watching a lot of work I don't understand son, just a little step guide you can make SVG logo animations as well.	O
That's always fun.	CHITCHAT
I did that for a nap project at work.	O
So we get a laugh.	CHITCHAT
Animated hum.	CHITCHAT
Logo.	O
Actually used body movements for that, so they use the plugin for after effects to that one.	O
So we're going to do the same thing.	O
When I called this group too.	O
And then I'm going to.	O
Make sure I have the whole thing here.	O
Hope too far.	O
Closed group.	O
Who are you?	CHITCHAT
From what?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Me make sure I've got the whole group.	O
Select Who?	CHITCHAT
Make sure got the whole thing.	O
Not even watching a lot of Animations Dreams you need to get into like.	O
Actually doing some.	O
So we got that fixed.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
This copied the whole ID.	O
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Now we got our little.	CHITCHAT
I know it's probably like super hard to even see what's happening but.	O
All of this stuff here.	O
It's all moving groups together.	O
So each other.	O
Parents, I says moving with this.	O
This guy is all moving with this and get another second animation happening in the helmet.	O
And like I said before we should have set everything up to make animating individual elements inside of the.	O
Sing there.	O
Jetpack we should have made it so entering the jetpack flames, which will be easy and so when we got left we've got the stars.	O
For I have need to have similar to how we do the Dogo and we need to have the	O
Jetpack Planes kind of like pulse in scale and those lines reaching with Azure Ray.	O
Trick come in animate.	O
Like Sparks basically.	O
And we're like motion lines or something.	O
And we need to, uh, maybe have the arm.	O
I'm thinking of holding the wrench turns up and down.	O
It can get that will be everything that we do.	O
You make this happen.	O
Yeah, but here like all the time.	O
It has done.	O
There's like 10 minutes left, so let's read the chat and we'll see maybe we can get the fire flames sort of whole thing that might be as far as we get so.	O

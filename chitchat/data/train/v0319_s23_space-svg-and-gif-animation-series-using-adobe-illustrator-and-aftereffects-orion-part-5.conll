So what is 100 percentages of that are so on and so forth so.	O
Leave um.	CHITCHAT
I'm probably gonna mess up, but we'll see.	CHITCHAT
Need to remember.	CHITCHAT
I need to go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's just try this.	CHITCHAT
I think I can use.	O
The animation pill for this.	O
Say no.	CHITCHAT
Calling someone by.	CHITCHAT
Not sure, OK I need to touch it.	O
I need to send my transform origin after I did wrong.	O
Alright, so we need to grab, uhm, this is this would be a good thing to show you guys so you need to make this not full screen for a second summer in illustrator.	O
Back.	O
This is kind of an important point for SVG animating so.	O
In order to.	O
So we are set to transform origin point on your objects that you're animating.	O
It will feel terrible that one there.	O
It will set the point of origin in your SVG.	O
When you're adding a transform, it will set it to like 0 zero, which is you know like.	O
Upper left hand corner essentially.	O
So we want to make sure that when we make this animation.	O
Since we're having it more round, we go into here and grab the X&Y coordinates from illustrator.	O
You can find up here.	O
You can also find them.	O
History actually has a couple of handy with old windows here for this kind of thing in the transform or properties.	O
OK, so yeah, you can grab it here as well.	O
I believe there is a way to get the.	O
Who is that?	CHITCHAT
This way it'll give you the.	O
You will show you the.	O
Excellent there it is I will show you the Little X&Y, became hovering over that and show me the X&Y coordinates for something that I'm hovering over.	O
There's also.	O
Any illustrator apparel that I've had not?	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Clay was very much.	O
This is SVD interactive interaction, which let's you apply.	O
Certain events Click on click events and stuff like that in illustrator before you export, but I haven't played with that very much, although it intrigues me very much.	O
And then there's also the CSS properties and how we played very much with.	O
It does give you basically the CSS breakdown of the individual item that you're looking at.	O
So if I only wanted the CSS code for the fire pop open, this little guy here that can copy literally this out.	O
That's the other.	O
Interesting little interesting little lab tools you have here.	O
I haven't.	O
Mess with this too much, but certainly on my list of things to check out more in depth so.	O
Now he's gone off track there for a second, you need to go back up here.	O
You actually give are.	O
Fire a transformed Oregon where it needs to be so we are going to split this out in a separate groups.	O
Origin.	O
I'm not confident that I had that spelled correctly.	O
Where is my mouse found it?	O
What's this?	CHITCHAT
Hopefully fix our problem.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
I forgot how to spell wrong.	CHITCHAT
Who had this photo?	CHITCHAT

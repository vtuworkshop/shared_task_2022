So what I'm going to do is actually going to know I need this year.	O
I'm just going to do basically the same.	O
Thing, but I want to change these two.	O
Fine.	CHITCHAT
All sex.	CHITCHAT
We go through that.	CHITCHAT
Super fun, right?	CHITCHAT
Seminole secondary thing is animating in this one.	O
Now that we have, like way overshot it by like 10 minutes.	O
This is where we're at, so I have saved SVG, so I can actually should be able to open it.	O
She got.	O
Open way.	O
We just drag it up to you.	O
No OK.	CHITCHAT
I don't know where can open.	O
Tractor supply.	O
One of the open with.	O
There we go alright, so drags down here she could see.	O
Where at?	CHITCHAT
Sir.	CHITCHAT
So that's where we got to, uhm?	O
Two day I will honestly.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I may or may not go in and animate the Stars, Um.	O
A Mega Ledonne finished the rest of Animation.	O
He asked EG portion of it um today tonight so that.	O
Tomorrow we're just working all in after effects 'cause I don't want to spend on the day that you like.	CHITCHAT
Playing my head against.	CHITCHAT
The screen trying to get this as we use that to happen, but I think this is pretty good.	O
Uh, could you pretty good idea of what?	O
Did you ever actually is a pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
You can also.	CHITCHAT
It's also response.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
And this will just animate um forever, just like the other one he did so.	O
We go animation is always so like.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Visually interesting as well.	O
The filtration stuff I'm illustrating things like everything is exciting.	O
A lot of a lot of Mebrate thinking very cerebral.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
So what we go, um?	CHITCHAT
Hope you guys enjoyed.	CHITCHAT
I know that it was like I said, little bit technical us animation stuff always is pizza.	CHITCHAT
Cortina We are looking good.	CHITCHAT
And then we'll have three animations that we will have done on the live stream together.	O
3 three illustrations.	O
Three SVG animations.	O
Three animations that we didn't.	O
After effects, which, like I said before I've explored the models MP fours, but you could exploit them out as.	O
PNG sequence board gift directly out of media encoder or it brings up PNG sequence from after effects into Photoshop.	O
Make it that way.	O
Or just a Verizon video format I did hear Speaking of something you want to go out there, I definitely want to get in after work tomorrow, but I guess after effects counts before it's like.	O
What like light stroke lifts like tapered lines?	O
So that seems to me with the new update.	CHITCHAT
So excited to check that out and see if I can just import my line so I haven't actually do anything that would be cool.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT

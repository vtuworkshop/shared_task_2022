Oh, good morning everybody.	CHITCHAT
Hello hello, hopefully will people are able to hear and see even having a little bit of a little bit of technical drugs this morning.	CHITCHAT
But it looks like everything is coming together so hopefully it's all good.	CHITCHAT
I'm having Abrams.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to another mograph breakfast.	CHITCHAT
We're going to see we're going to see what we get into today.	O
Arrange my windows.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, uh, good to see you could see some folks hanging out with this morning.	CHITCHAT
This is a thing we get into here all the time, every weekend.	CHITCHAT
From 9:00 AM my time until later.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure how how long will go today we should go for a couple hours, but we'll see.	CHITCHAT
If I get through all this stuff and it really depends on what stuff we get into.	CHITCHAT
If you're hanging out with us last week, let's see, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there we go now we're good now we're good if you're hanging over the last week we were working in cinema 4D light to try to make sort of a creepy fantasy gate thing for a weird gift series that I wanted to get into.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we'll continue that work.	CHITCHAT
Maybe yeah, let's do that.	CHITCHAT
And what I wanted to do was try to composite some things together in there.	O
So let's step back in and see where we are at.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So uh, hey good morning oh hey, who got hang it?	CHITCHAT
We got Ahmed hanging out we got PD from Spain.	CHITCHAT
Hello Gatineau zone Baker big like a pro hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Hello hello everybody.	CHITCHAT
Where you are in the world, those of us in the Greater Ottawa area are are enjoying some relaxing.	CHITCHAT
Some relaxing COVID-19 restrictions.	CHITCHAT
So that's always good.	CHITCHAT
But in terms of what we were doing last time we were working in cinema 4D to make this kind of door gateway thing.	O
And one of the things you know, I went ahead and skipped a lot of the texturing stuff.	O
I wanted to kind of look like a toy, you know 'cause.	O
I thought that was a funny idea, so that's where we kind of have this plasticky look.	O
But I didn't do anything for the Sky, so the Sky is completely.	O
We can't how's it go?	CHITCHAT
And the Sky is completely open.	O
You know why?	CHITCHAT
Didn't put any things back there in the in the render so it's completely wide open for us to put all kinds of stuff back there.	O
So in terms of what elements I kind of want to drop down here, let's see.	O
What I've done in the?	CHITCHAT
What I've done in the cinema 4D file is too messy.	O
Camps here or what would have been laughs kind of.	O
I removed the sconces.	O
Just because I'm not sure yet.	O
Not sure yet how really to composite that, but we have two lights there that are changing and intensity kind of way firewood.	O

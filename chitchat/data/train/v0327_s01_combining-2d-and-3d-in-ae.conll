So we might animate some little fires to go here in there.	O
I definitely want to do something, some kind of background up here, maybe some clouds.	O
And maybe some like gentle gradient sweeps.	O
Maybe not a gradient.	O
Per say, right, but kind of a messy swished upgradient.	O
So maybe will try to do that.	CHITCHAT
I think that will be a fun.	CHITCHAT
Exploration to get into, hopefully, and we'll see how it goes.	O
I don't know about master Evan.	O
I'm more like a more like a more like a chill buddy Evan, that's what that's where I'd rather be at.	O
OK, so yeah, let's uhm.	CHITCHAT
Dive in.	CHITCHAT
It's all good people, people dip in and out of this program all the time.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, let's let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's get into it.	CHITCHAT
I woke up like half an hour ago, so things might be a little bit slow.	CHITCHAT
So I want to put.	O
Some kind of interesting gradient back there.	O
I want it to kind of loop.	O
In some way, the whole idea of this is to be a looping GIF.	O
So if I want this to loop that I need to think of a few looping techniques.	O
Uh, one of them that is very, very useful way to think about this stuff.	O
It's kind of like Zoetrope style, like if you're able to rap a cylinder all the way around something right?	O
If you created a comp that's kind of the same on the edges, then just offset it then.	O
Everything will be fine so.	O
I'll make one of those, so let's see.	O
This is 1080 by 1080 so.	O
I should be able to make something out of this.	O
Start with.	O
So the solid takes up the whole space blob like that.	O
Have any other solids going on in here?	O
And no, I want this one, yeah?	CHITCHAT
So what I'm doing?	CHITCHAT
Making sure these things are spaced out.	O
So right now we definitely have a pattern.	O
So if I were to.	O
Simply start rotating this thing around.	O
You know this end would match up with that end, right?	O
If I were to do an offset of that, so we're going to be a comp too.	O
I'm going to call this.	O
Skyline Now I like a nice wide one.	O
Technically we could have done this chopping this completely in half, but I kind of want more room to play with to give myself some variation in this thing and to make it less apparent when.	O
When the rotation through happens, so I'm going to bring a skyline in here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So as you can see, it's now sitting behind.	O
That thing cool.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I use the directional blur.	CHITCHAT
The old directional blur.	O
No blur.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
To fuzz these out.	O
Goes high is 540 on this.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I may come less Michael more I don't know.	O
Here's a thing that you do need to do though is to put one out here, because these two are technically supposed to be the same thing.	O
Good afternoon Huma corn hello hello, hope everyone is having a good time out here.	O
That's what I think I'll do.	O
Lower this one.	O
'cause I want to create.	O
Some variation out here maybe.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, now we should be able to seamlessly go from one side to the other.	O
See how that works.	CHITCHAT

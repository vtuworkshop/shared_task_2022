I think the general idea is good.	CHITCHAT
Execution of idea, maybe not.	O
Not being able to.	O
Yeah, I am missing the little branches.	O
You know, I'm I'm missing.	O
Having little connective branches.	O
And the floating leaves kind of make me unhappy.	O
So I can try to cluster these up a little.	O
Get the more clustered.	O
See if that helps my disposition on the matter.	O
I don't want to increase their density necessarily.	O
Now they're real real shrubs.	O
Shrub Life OK.	O
Let's just go until nothing is disconnected.	O
Go back to this.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
Oh, how did the 1005 here too?	O
Yeah, this is kind of working out actually, actually.	O
I know it shouldn't shouldn't be surprised at it now.	O
Something to say is I'm careful not to rotate.	O
These Schreber Louise.	O
Because.	CHITCHAT
The way we have.	CHITCHAT
Things undulating through them, right?	O
If we were to rotate it at that undulation, flow wouldn't really make that much sense, and it wouldn't seem like they're all kind of getting affected by the same wind.	O
So just a tip there, I suppose.	O
Oh, really doesn't feel like we're coming out of the Woods on this thing.	O
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
If you go out in the Woods today, don't go to a creepy door.	O
If you go out in the Woods today.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn turn turn.	CHITCHAT
Don't don't, don't don't.	CHITCHAT
OK, OK.	CHITCHAT
Not really feeling lightning myself.	O
Although that part was kind of funny.	O
I like this.	CHITCHAT
Mad is shiny, but I'll figure that out later.	O
Walking through the Woods you encounter free plastic looking cats Castle.	O
Funny.	CHITCHAT
OK, I want to do some kind of torch fire and I know we beefed it earlier earlier episode.	O
Did not go well.	O
The fire truck.	O
Oh well oh yards Oh my goodness so sorry everybody.	O
Now I've seen a few.	O
Guess the mat were smaller.	O
Absolutely it would.	CHITCHAT
Everything's about proportion.	O
Is there anything I want to tweak?	O
Would I like to return to cinema 4D?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh Sure, let's see what happens.	CHITCHAT

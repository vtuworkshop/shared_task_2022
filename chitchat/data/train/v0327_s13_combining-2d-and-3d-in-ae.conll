I really like how the Sinner Where is sort of.	CHITCHAT
Really able to.	CHITCHAT
Time.	CHITCHAT
You know the Sinner?	CHITCHAT
Where does such a great job of pulling pulling things together?	CHITCHAT
That that that that her mother is the welcome mat.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I was trying to make a bool.	O
I was trying to.	O
I was trying to stick letters in the welcome mat.	O
Ended up not being useful.	O
But Uh.	CHITCHAT
Could have them at curl up a bit in the breeze, who that's a very light Matt.	O
I don't think that's a welcome mat you would want, but we can try it.	O
Let's see if we can do that by warping this geometry.	O
I've done it with extrude.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
So I would think, Oh yeah, I've got access to a bend.	O
Why don't I just go ahead and bring that on, you know?	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Hey good morning to Timo Yeah it is starting to look like something.	CHITCHAT
I think it's starting to look like something nice, you know.	O
I think it's certainly go interesting places.	O
OK, so 'cause right now we're looking at display we got.	O
We got our garage shading lines going on.	O
Let me just see here what I can do about so that's got segments.	O
Close this bad boy segment situation.	O
OK, that's got segments.	O
Extrude caps	O
I need are.	CHITCHAT
Look Maybe this will help.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have to replace that.	O
I don't think it can be.	O
I don't want to extrude.	O
Maybe I'll just show why 1st and then, then we'll get into it.	O
So we got this extrude with this welcome mat.	O
Welcome at I'm going to put do we have a band I gotta OK?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Click.	O
Alright, attempt to bend the welcome mat.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's not going to.	O
Uh-huh Yeah, the geometry it is de forming.	O
Hold on, hold on.	CHITCHAT
Hold on step one, uh.	O
File new project.	O
That thing was too cluttered.	O
I was confusing myself.	O
Let's see, I'm gonna make us make us this.	O
Everybody's audio is not In Sync, it's crazy.	O

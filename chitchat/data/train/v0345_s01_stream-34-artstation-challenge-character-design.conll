We're just going to pick up where we left off on my Twitch stream earlier today, which was pretty much finishing the costumes up and then transitioning into the line, drawing so that's where we are now I can show you what I'm talking about.	O
First off, I'm doing the art station challenge.	O
If you guys don't know what that is, you can go to artst.com.	CHITCHAT
If you go to the very top, you'll see a tab that says challenges.	CHITCHAT
If you click that, you'll see the box of mystery challenge.	CHITCHAT
You can do various challenges for that one, which is there's like character design, environment, key frame design, animation, and then like prop design.	CHITCHAT
I think that's all of 'em I'm doing the character design one and I've been basing this challenge.	O
I'll show you what I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
This is where we are.	CHITCHAT
We are working on the leader characters.	O
Costumes here's the costume designs we were doing for the past week or two.	O
Not just this one, but all of 'em.	O
So this is for the wild character.	O
This is for the joyful character.	O
This one is very very rough.	O
I got pretty lazy with this one.	O
The brave character.	O
The serious character.	O
And the is that it I miss all the mischievous character.	O

Basically taking the original sketch I did of the body here.	O
I did this on my stream earlier today, so this is what you guys missed out on.	O
Took the original sketch I did I modified it a little bit to fix the anatomy to fix the pose to fix the arms and now I'm doing costume.	O
So I'm looking at the head and the heads not looking good to Maine.	O
I don't like how straight on our faces it looks kind of static to Maine.	O

So what we call a Facebook app that he does.	CHITCHAT
Now.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so real quick.	CHITCHAT

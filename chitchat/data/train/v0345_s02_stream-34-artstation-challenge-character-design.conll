He's purring.	CHITCHAT
He's a big sweet guy, even if he doesn't want you to know it.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like her looking up a bit.	CHITCHAT
That's who he's drooling.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put there.	CHITCHAT
I think that looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
BECU and into the microphone.	CHITCHAT
Big guy.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, So what I was gonna say he's gonna leave soon.	CHITCHAT
Actually he's going to leave soon because he hates when I talk.	CHITCHAT
Whenever I stream, he doesn't like how like loud and how much I talk, so he'll leave pretty soon 'cause he hates it.	CHITCHAT
Everybody.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so if you guys don't know what this is like I said This is part of the art station challenge, but originally we were working on the worldbuilding project that I'm doing, so I've kind of.	CHITCHAT
Reserve these be hand streams for working on this personal project.	CHITCHAT
Typically before I was doing commissions, so I'll be doing commissions a lot on my Twitch Channel when I stream.	CHITCHAT
But once I started doing these being and streams I was like alright.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to use these streams to work on this personal worldbuilding project that I otherwise don't really get time to work on.	CHITCHAT
So it's going to be an interactive map of Lauren Legends.	CHITCHAT
Essentially, this map that you can click around on you can highlight different regions.	CHITCHAT
You can see the icons that exist on each region.	CHITCHAT
And those icons just correspond with different characters, creatures, factions and kingdoms.	CHITCHAT
So it would essentially be an opportunity for me to fill up this world full of all the things I create.	CHITCHAT
All the people, all the creatures, anything I want to make.	CHITCHAT
I can kind of populate this world with.	CHITCHAT
So we've been using this stream here on be hands to work on that and that what you just saw was originally just a mock up.	CHITCHAT
It was just an initial idea of what that project could look like, but I hadn't actually developed anything for that world, so that's what we've been doing.	CHITCHAT
For the past couple months, I guess working on different concepts for this project.	CHITCHAT
The creatures in the races and the people that exist in this world.	CHITCHAT
Some of these are just sketches, just initial doodles I did, but we've been exploring ideas for the other ones.	CHITCHAT
All the ones in color are the ones we've actually kind of jumped into and explore it a little bit.	CHITCHAT
So I'm taking a break from that now and I'm using these creatures and people I've created to do this artstation challenge.	CHITCHAT
So this is something that will work for the challenge, but I can also use it afterwards for my worldbuilding project if I choose to, so I try to come up with like a little story that makes sense in this world.	CHITCHAT
These people are the protectors of the second realm, the Giants are kind of these mythological creatures that exist in that second realm, but not many people.	CHITCHAT
Oh, he's leaving.	CHITCHAT
So this tale.	CHITCHAT
Tell says I'm outta here.	CHITCHAT
Shedding everywhere buddy.	CHITCHAT
What is up?	CHITCHAT
Well there how you doing man could see you welcome on an.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So anyway, I kind of developed a little story behind it that would make sense for this world building project and I decided to do the art station challenge based off that.	O
So we got all these different costumes worked up, but we're finally at the point now for each character where.	O
I can actually draw them out and start working on the finished.	O
Painting, I mean finished drawing first, but.	O
Then afterwards, we'll do the painting so.	O
These are all the poses that we're using for each character.	O
They all have a different role in this Group A different job.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Now it's time to.	O
Work this character up a bit.	O
That's the goal.	O
Today we're going to be working on the leader character, the.	O
Let's have a selection.	O
Still, yeah, the costume that you're looking at here is just a reference.	O
That's the costume.	O
I like the most it was actually a combination of a couple costumes combination of this one.	O
Along with I think it's hidden right now, but.	O
I put a few of them together and copied and pasted until I got that and I like it.	O
I think it fits the mood I'm going for for her, so now it's just.	O
Tend to design it out on the sexual.	O
The actual character drawing and.	O

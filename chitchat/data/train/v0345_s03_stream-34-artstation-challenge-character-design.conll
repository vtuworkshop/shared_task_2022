See how it goes.	CHITCHAT
We may be painting today too, but I'm not looking to do like a super finished.	CHITCHAT
Drawing I don't do like really finish line work, I'm just going to do as much as I need to, so we'll see how much that is.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really sure.	CHITCHAT
Doing good an you I'm doing pretty well, can't complain.	CHITCHAT
I'm kind of excited to be at this stage of the project, so that's good.	CHITCHAT
Looking forward to.	CHITCHAT
Drawing this character out of it.	CHITCHAT
As the years have gone on, I've been more and more trying to.	CHITCHAT
Figure out how to be efficient with my line drawings and my paintings to not spend longer polishing them and making them perfect.	CHITCHAT
You know longer than I need to.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
We'll see how that goes.	CHITCHAT
But I don't really do cleaning King or anything.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you guys have seen my more finish line work process.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you have.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I've done something on here that was more finished line work.	CHITCHAT
But I don't have the time to do super clean finish line work, but in general I don't.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really someone who does like cleaning King.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of artists out there who have like a more structured style in terms of their line drawing.	CHITCHAT
It's very like a line drawing is very much part of the finished piece.	CHITCHAT
So they do like cleaning King and a lot of that.	CHITCHAT
I do not.	CHITCHAT
My line work is just a.	CHITCHAT
Blueprint for what the painting should be.	CHITCHAT
So I like to keep my aligns pretty loose.	CHITCHAT
But I'm trying to get better at that.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to get better at everything.	CHITCHAT
But I think I've gotten better at keeping my lines pretty loosen.	CHITCHAT
Keeping my paintings loose to trying to improve it that all the time.	CHITCHAT
I actually could be doing this stage with my iPad.	CHITCHAT
And think about that could be doing this in Frisco or something.	CHITCHAT
Just because I like doing line work in Frisco or just like on the iPad in general, 'cause the screen right now I'm using an intro so not using a centriq or anything, but being able to draw directly on the screen does give you some.	CHITCHAT
Some nice control.	CHITCHAT
But I'm definitely much more comfortable at the moment.	CHITCHAT
Painting and photo shop drawing, I think frescoes pretty nice.	CHITCHAT
I like drawing in Photoshop two with an intuos.	CHITCHAT
It does kind of lend itself to like really gestural loose line work.	CHITCHAT
So when I'm drawing a character	CHITCHAT
You know, I say pretty loose with it, it's hard to.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to tighten up too much.	CHITCHAT
I don't know just 'cause the nature of the movements but.	CHITCHAT
I'm going a bit tighter.	CHITCHAT
It is nice to have.	CHITCHAT
Have a screen tablet.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we do have a.	CHITCHAT
Oh, OK.	CHITCHAT
I'll save it.	CHITCHAT

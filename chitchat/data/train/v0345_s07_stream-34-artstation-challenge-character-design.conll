Thank you this tale guys.	CHITCHAT
It's getting all up in Maine all up in my business.	CHITCHAT
So I want to see the top of the hand a little bit.	O
Something like that.	O
Right, that red screen cap in that guys is, uh, this is Eminem.	O
Say hi to Mr Eminem.	O
They had everyone Eminem.	O
He's making biscuits.	O
He's a little biscuit maker.	O
Most animals put there years back when therapist scared fight or flight mode.	O
Yeah, I'm just thinking of like Disney movies where it definitely seems kind of lower.	O
Let's see, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Eminem I gotta work brother.	CHITCHAT
I gotta work, brother.	CHITCHAT
Alright, where's my pen?	O
Oh Sorry, I'm going to steal that from you.	O
Alright, let's see that worked Eminem come on biting my pen.	CHITCHAT
We got a Kitty tail in our reference image.	CHITCHAT
I'll see if we can do this loosely, I'm not.	O
Not looking too.	O
Super in depth here.	O
And what I mean by that is I'm trying to keep this challenge pretty loose, like my only hopes of finishing this challenge by the deadline, which is July.	O
13th my only hopes is keeping these characters pretty loose.	O
I just don't have the time to spend very long in each character and knowing me, man.	O
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Like if I'm using.	O
My last commissions as an example.	O
There's no way I would finish this in time, so I gotta do something to adapt and be quicker about it.	O
Or it just won't work?	O
Adapt and overcome.	O
So like these these drawings are going to have to be pretty loose.	O
I can't get super detailed with the drawings.	O
There's no stage of this project that is going to be.	O
I think I'm going to be allowed to spend super long on it.	O
And I don't know how realistic it is.	O
'cause I think I said I'll have two days to spend on each character, but that's man.	O
That's counting the drawing, so that's even if I'm fast with the drawing, that's one day of painting per character and I just.	O
Probably just not realistic.	O
I don't even know what a scroll looks like.	O
I'm just kind of making it out.	O
But it's whatever I'm going to give it my best shot.	O
Hand is looking not right.	O

Do you want to make this risk peace?	O
Bit bigger.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to try to take a picture of my.	O
My other hand.	O
Let's see how that works.	O
Alright, so this one is just a.	O
Just one of these.	O
Is it going to be?	O
This is going to be an awkward angle to do it at.	O
Why does this feel so weird but just be better?	O
Now it's awkward all around.	O
I may have to stand up for this one.	O
Bear with me, everybody.	O
See if we can make this happen.	O
What's up Sam?	CHITCHAT
So it's supposed to be this way.	O
Can I flip this?	O
Does this work?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there we go.	O
But can I Reach?	O
I don't know if that was that was good.	O
Eminem, I'm trying to work here buddy.	CHITCHAT
You can't just come screaming in at me.	CHITCHAT
Can't just come screaming at me.	CHITCHAT
Wow, you guys hurt him.	CHITCHAT
He's screaming Map.	CHITCHAT
Whoa jeez.	CHITCHAT
Now that got caught between my headphones.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see if that one worked.	O
By Eminem.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we'll get our previous one.	O
Yay, alright go ahead.	CHITCHAT
Crop that.	O
See if it worked.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Very low quality screen cap.	O
I don't like my face in there.	O
Crop it out.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see if that angle works.	O
It actually looks pretty good.	O
Come on, I don't want to.	O
I do not want crowd.	O
Just let me hockey thank you please.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's get this hand down real quick.	O
Will save it 'cause I don't know.	O
When I last saved.	O
So this is my typical process for this kind of thing.	O
I'll try to take what's for my head.	O
First, get that out on paper and then.	O
Informant with reference.	O
So I always try to get my ideas out of my head.	O
I don't like to let reference dictate my piece or my ideas.	O
I mean sometimes I do have to get reference like from the get go if I'm completely drawing a blank is like the more, the more you build your visual library, the more ideas you'll have.	O
The more design ideas you'll have when you're starting a character, the more you're comfortable.	O
Withdrawing the human figure, you know the more experience you have, the more you're able to kind of do that from your head.	O
So sometimes.	O
Sometimes I do have to start with the reference, but typically with stuff like this specially poses and hand poses.	O

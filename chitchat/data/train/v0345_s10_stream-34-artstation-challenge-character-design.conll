I liked it sometimes do it from my head and then take a picture to match that.	O
But you know, sometimes if you can't visualize with the hand should look like like I'll usually do it with shapes like this is the palm.	O
And if you can't tell what I'm doing, here is essentially.	O
This is the shape in perspective that I'm drawing with that plane, so the one below is just a plain, but here's me essentially doing it like in terms of.	O
A 3D shape, so I'm always trying to think 3 dimensionally and then the finger is attached here.	O
You know the thumb is kind of on this pad here.	O
Attaches out there.	O
That kind of thing, but when I do it like this a lot of times you'll just see any kind of do this sort of thing, and then I do like stick figure E.	O
Fingers.	O
Just to see, you know, just to get the idea and the risk would go that way, so that's kind of what I did with this initial drawing, but.	O
OK at.	CHITCHAT
Drawing out hands are really loose rough way.	O
Sometimes it's just easier to pose.	O
Suppose your hand take a picture and then you get a more dynamic hand.	O
Whatever works.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think this hands pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Good enough for my purposes.	CHITCHAT
Purpose is being just may be thrown down some pain in just a moment.	O
Let's move.	O
This will hide this in this tab.	O
Come back to it if we need it.	O
But yeah, it's like almost every character painting I do very good chance I'm going to be referencing my own hand hands.	O
'cause it's almost like why not?	O
Specially with my little set up with OBSI, can just use my webcam real quick screencap it.	O
It's like I'd be a lot Lazier if I had to.	O
Do it with a camera and then upload that to my computer.	O
There's a bunch of different steps.	O
One thing I do, which is funny.	O
It shouldn't be the most.	O
It shouldn't be the quickest, most efficient way to do it, but as far as I know it is.	O
And maybe you guys will know better quicker way.	O
But the best, fastest way to take a picture and get it into photo shop.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I try to use a was Adobe capture for this once, but then I realized there's no just camera.	O
Option is all like kind of graphic or stylized, unless I'm.	O
Missing something, but what I do is I'll just take a picture with my phone and then I'll send that.	O
Image directly to discord.	O
And then I can just copy and paste the image from discord into photo shop, 'cause I've emailed it to myself before.	O
But then you have to open your email.	O
Then you have to download the image.	O
Then you have to find the image and then you got to open it up.	O
Discord is just like bam.	O
I already have it open.	O
So I send it to a chat with my friends and I'll just grab it from there.	O
It doesn't seem like it should be the most efficient way, probably isn't, but for me that's what I do.	O
That's what I do if I actually have to take a picture.	O
That's why I like this, though I can do like on camera and just pulled up my hand print screen.	O
Pasted into photo shop.	O
Works fairly well for olsam.	O
Now what do you guys think?	O
That's pretty decent, right halfway decent.	O
Who says color?	O

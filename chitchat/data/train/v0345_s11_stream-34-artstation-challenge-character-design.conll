What?	CHITCHAT
Oh beeps, how'd you get in here?	CHITCHAT
What the heck?	CHITCHAT
'cause it's beeper?	CHITCHAT
Any real name is melody.	CHITCHAT
But we call it beeped, she beeps like that.	CHITCHAT
She's a sweet lady in case anyone was unaware beeps.	CHITCHAT
Can you tell?	CHITCHAT
There she is.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, tell me how sweet you are.	CHITCHAT
Sweet beats.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of mittens.	CHITCHAT
Adorable.	CHITCHAT
Use switch app is that for that purpose?	CHITCHAT
Alright, you guys are shedding all over this room.	CHITCHAT
Why are you getting from my tablet?	CHITCHAT
Do you want me to do?	CHITCHAT
Alright, I gotta work.	CHITCHAT
Hi guys, I think it's painting time.	O
It is a 549 that's not bad.	O
Let's throw down some paint 'cause I wanted 'cause It's my favorite part of the.	O
Process.	O
Will make a mask.	CHITCHAT
Will do a quick mask.	O
Well, that was weird.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm going crazy.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I just saw some weird glitch.	O
Visual glitch.	O
That could be crazy.	CHITCHAT
It's very possible.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to make a mask here.	O
I'm just doing a solid shape underneath my line drawing.	O
So the line drawings on one layer.	O
The backgrounds on its own layer.	O
This mask is now going to be on its own layer and I just use this hard round brush with zero opacity jitter just to fill it in.	O
Quick and easy.	O
Like none of this is ever precise.	O
When I used to do this process for character design, I had a bunch of different layers and they all have their own function.	O
I do a line layer like I'm like, I just did I do a mask layer like I'm doing now and then I would have a flat color layer and then I'd have a multiply layer for shadow.	O
And I'd have a.	O
Pick a color Dodge layer or something for lighting and then I would have like 2 multipliers for shadows.	O
Actually I'd have one for the main shadows and then one for the ambient occlusion shadows and it was like this whole account app.	O
Process I definitely don't do that anymore.	O
It's a lot more, just free like freeforms draw.	O
Let's go for it.	CHITCHAT
I enjoy the way I paint so much more now.	O
But I used to do like very clean masks.	O
I guess is what I was getting at.	O
I would do these look.	O
Very clean masks and then I would do.	O
Very clean flat colors and like each each layer had to be very clean.	O
And then if I wanted to change something, I would have to change like every layer and have to change my mask to accommodate for the new shape and I have to update my.	O
Flat color layer.	O
For that shape, whatever shape I added onto the figure, if it requires a mask change.	O
Of course you like say I put a little pom-pom ball on the shoulder.	O
I'd have to add that into the mask.	O
And then I have to fix it in the flag colors and I have to fix it in the shadows in the lights in every single layer and.	O
I just realized there's certain parts of that process that were like tedious for me that I didn't enjoy.	O
So this is probably like the only tedious technical process where I'm.	O
Making a mask, but like even in this instance, the mask is very loose.	O
It doesn't need to be clean because I'm going to be continuing to modify it as I designed this character.	O
I'm not going to go back and modify the mask, but just by painting on top of things, I'll be modifying these shape so everything now is much more like freeform, much more casual, much more loose.	O
And I enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy the process a lot more.	CHITCHAT
The way I'm talking about that, I used to work that was, oh, you're probably two years ago.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
A couple years ago.	CHITCHAT
But I think it's important to try different processes.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Try different techniques, try different methods, try different workflows.	CHITCHAT
All that stuff.	CHITCHAT
I was like experiment and try new things 'cause if you see someone working a certain way and you're like oh that kind of looks like it makes sense.	CHITCHAT
Like I get, I get why they're doing it that way.	CHITCHAT
It seems convenient, seems effective or efficient, I should say.	CHITCHAT

Seems fun, whatever it may be.	CHITCHAT
I think it's.	CHITCHAT
Important to try those 'cause you'll never know otherwise.	CHITCHAT
And then you slowly find what works for you.	CHITCHAT
What you don't like, what you do like.	CHITCHAT
I've definitely worked had very different work flows over the years and.	CHITCHAT
I feel like now the past year or two I feel like I've really settled into.	CHITCHAT
A method with a bit more comfortable for Maine.	CHITCHAT
So I don't think that ever stops.	CHITCHAT
I don't think it ever you never done.	CHITCHAT
That's probably how I always feel.	CHITCHAT
Like whatever time you're in the present.	CHITCHAT
The reason you're there is 'cause.	CHITCHAT
This seems to be the best option for you, so I just said.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't mean too much.	CHITCHAT
This is actually cleaner than I usually go on these masks, but.	O
I got some.	CHITCHAT
I gotta go as clean as the details.	O
Require.	CHITCHAT
Since I put more effort into these hands to refine the shape.	O
Have that reflect.	O
In the mask.	O
Oh, I still gotta put like a sword and stuff like that, yeah?	O
Yeah, when you turn it on, it hosts your phones entire Gallery as a server.	O
Oh, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
So you can do it from the browser.	O
Yeah, it sounds pretty convenient.	O
Alright, let's finish this up.	O
I'm getting antsy.	O
Get Nancy that through some colors down.	O
You just have to do the outline really.	O
Satellite Maine.	O
Contours here and you can always.	O
Fill it in.	O
I remember seeing someone say if you want to get rid of this white space, I usually just fill it in manually, but you can color pic actually.	O
Sample all layers probably want to turn that off.	O
Probably check contiguous.	O
Yeah, I usually have different settings on.	O
But you can, uh, do select.	O
Modify, expand, probably like 2 pixels.	O
Do the trick.	CHITCHAT
Fill it in.	O
Alright, let's try that again.	O
Select modify.	O
Expanded trade like 5 pixels and this is pretty high resolution.	O
That didn't work either.	O
Select modify, expand.	O
We're going to go 10 pixels.	O
Double it.	O
Hi there, not working.	CHITCHAT
Oh, but she totally be working strange.	O
Because if you do it twice, I guess it works.	O
So we just go, bam, bam, it works.	O
Gotta click twice.	O
The old double whammy.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I think that's the mask I'm going to turn the lines off.	O

222 I don't know why the flow is set to 80 for this.	O
That's what it always is for every brush.	O
Yeah, so that mask looks pretty good.	O
Definitely.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't need to be any cleaner than it is.	O
Alright, so at this point I'm going to lock the mask.	O
I'm going to make a new layer and will do just called paint and now we're going to rough in the colours.	O
Of this character.	O
So we gotta click, right click the new layer the paint layer.	O
And if anyone is not familiar with clipping masks, you can check out my layers here.	O
So this is the mask layer.	O
Don't play with me.	CHITCHAT
All Right, This is ridiculous.	O
Some things glitched and I don't know what.	O
Photo shop is really been, uh.	O
Going to having a lot of issues lately.	O
I don't know what to do, but.	O
It's not working, can't do anything.	O
Alright so it.	CHITCHAT
Photoshop.	CHITCHAT
Maybe if I just open it back up again I'll work.	O
Yeah, that was strange.	CHITCHAT
It's just trying to show you my layers.	O
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try it again.	CHITCHAT
I don't care.	CHITCHAT
Stubborn.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I got the line layers.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Got the mask layer beneath it.	O
And then I got the paint layer you can't see.	O
Right click that pain layer do create clipping mask in Eclipse it to the shape below it.	O
That was the most.	O
An eloquent explanation.	O
I'm getting glitches every minute, but.	O
You get the picture.	CHITCHAT
So now we can just color in the shape.	O
And I can literally just color pick from.	O
For my costume design that I worked up already.	O
Restart happening on illustrator.	O
Yeah, it looks like just opening or closing the file and opening it again.	O
Worked pretty well.	CHITCHAT
No, that little panning glitch I don't think is fixed by restarting, but hopefully that gets patched.	O
Pretty soon.	CHITCHAT
Keith Sweat.	O
Getting too needy.	O
I don't know if she's upset that I'm not petting her.	O
Just making little cooing noises.	O
So essentially what I do here is flat color.	O
This isn't like.	O
Strict flag coloring like I'm not doing it really deliberately like clean flat tones.	O
Just trying to kind of get a color palette in here and usually this is what I do if I'm doing a character from scratch.	O
Like if I don't have these designs ahead of time that I worked up.	O
I'll test out colors just by splashing it down, so I'll do some tones like this and.	O
Just kind of throw these colors around until I find.	O
Color palette looks pretty good to Maine.	O
But since I already know what colors they want, hardly know, it works pretty well so.	O
Now it's just a matter of throwing those colors down.	O

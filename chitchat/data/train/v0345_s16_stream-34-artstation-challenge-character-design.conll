The one painting layer, as much as I want.	O
I'm not.	O
And basically modifying the mask as I do so and.	O
If I want to clip anything to it, I can just clip it to the single painting layer at that point.	O
So basically modify my mask as I paint and I just merge it down anytime.	O
Happy with where it is.	CHITCHAT
Which I'm feeling inclined to do now.	O
Save it.	O
I don't think I I like to create backups for layers, but I don't think I need to.	O
So now this is just one layer and I can do whatever I want with it.	O
Cut into it.	O
I can add on do it.	O
Let's typically how I work.	O
That's just how I roll.	O
I found out some time ago, at least for me, there's no benefit to having a separate masking painting layer.	O
I'll just make my painting layer my mask layer and then.	O
And all is well.	CHITCHAT
And then if it any point you know I want to modify it with like a multiply layer, I'll just click that to this and we're good to go.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It seems so obvious I guess, but.	O
Years ago, back when I was using clipping masks, I remember getting frustrated by it.	O
'cause I didn't offer enough flexibility, but this solves all the.	O
All the problems.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I'm digging the shape though.	CHITCHAT
I like the shape of her, her waist.	O
On the.	CHITCHAT
Concept drawing on the left, but this feels weird.	O
So actually what I'm going to do is duplicate this layer.	O
So now I have two of these.	O
And this is where I like to modify, like this silhouette of it.	O
Like how it goes up into her waist, is that a little bit?	O
Her hips are a little bit.	O
More out his part.	O
Sometimes things make more sense.	O
To draw in line, they make more sense in line or they make more sense in shape, shape and color and right now.	O
The issue I'm saying might make more sense in shape and color 'cause I drew this, but now it looks weird to me when I'm seeing it in color.	O
But it could be crazy.	O
But that's why I duplicate.	O
Layers in case.	O
Case I'm wrong and I ruined it.	O
Take my speech just jumped over the gate and left.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
One thing I will say is fairly weird is that the background is very very close to the color of the shirt.	O
The white cloth that she's wearing so.	O
In these instances, I'll just try to find a background that contrasts everything fairly nicely, and I would have to go pretty darker, pretty light to achieve that.	O
So I've noticed something when I color pic from another document, it switches.	O

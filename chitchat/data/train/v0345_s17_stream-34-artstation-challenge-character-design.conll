It activates that document.	O
I don't think Photoshop used to do that.	O
I'm getting this weird thing every time I click.	O
Like it has to take a second to load.	O
And realize that's Why.	O
'cause I don't think it used to do that.	O
I don't like it too bright, bugs me harsh on my eyes.	O
Maybe we could do this a little bit darker.	O
Oh, it looks fine to me now.	CHITCHAT
Go ahead and do that.	O
So I was messing with the waste here to try to.	O
Better ways to look a little bit more like it does.	O
Or her hips more so.	O
Like it does in the original.	O
Mock up to the left.	O
So what I can do is I can save it.	O
And then I can.	O
Check the old layer.	O
This why duplicate layers.	O
Do the old Abe.	O
Thing is, this is contradicting my line drawing, that's why don't go super super like finished on my line drawings 'cause sometimes my line drawings all determined are not the best.	O
They're not correct there, not what I want.	O
So jumping between painting and drawing like this kind of gives me the best of both worlds.	O
I guess some things make more sense.	O
Like I said in line drawing.	O
Some things make more sense in shape.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Kind of do your best.	O
Work it up as much as you can.	O
In one and then you can move to the other and you can always jump back to the first one so I can always.	O
I'm always welcome to go back to my line drawing here and.	O
Fit the shapes that I've now done.	O
But I think I like that it's very minor tweak, but I think it looks OK.	O
So with that said.	O
Let's move on to the face.	O
I'm going to make a new layer.	O
Oh, I didn't realize what I was doing.	O
Excuse me.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'll make a new layer in case I messed this up.	O
That's pretty much every damn.	O
I don't want to mess something up that already have 'cause I think the face looks pretty good.	O
I got some like good graphic.	O
Shapes and colors and stuff and it's an OK start.	O
So I'm happy with what I have.	O
Don't want to ruin it?	O
So a lot of times when I'm painting, I'm just trying to identify the.	O
The highlights.	O
The mid tone and the shadow.	O
So you're probably going to see that like where is the deepest shadows where the really dark points.	O
I just make a note of it, make a little marked indicated.	O
For example, I don't have the nostrils or the mouth, and that makes this pretty confusing to look at without the line work, so put in the nostrils.	O
Little indicator points for the edges of the mouth.	O
By the whole mouth I guess.	O
And then from here I have enough information to start putting.	O

Down some more, paint some more.	O
Visual info like where the cheekbone is now?	O
I know where the.	O
Edge of the nose is putting a little lakeside shadow here.	O
So I try to keep it pretty loose.	O
Try to keep it pretty loosey goosey.	O
He's very planer.	O
Plane ular for some reason his word I want to say that doesn't exist.	O
And then I got some eyebrows.	O
Just put those in just to indicate like her expression.	O
The placement of the eyes and all that the eyebrows is going to.	O
She looks pretty angry.	O
I don't know if I want the address to be read, maybe just like a dark green.	O
The eyebrows are going to control a lot of the expression, so I'm hoping I can.	O
Open I can get that down pretty well.	O
Get it to read it properly from such a loose state is definitely a big goal.	O
If you can get it to read early, then that means.	O
You doing your focus in other correct stuff.	O
Too easy to get caught up in details.	O
But if you can get the big picture to read from this state than the hard parts done.	CHITCHAT
How many screens?	CHITCHAT
I have three.	CHITCHAT
I got my monitor that I'm doing the painting on.	CHITCHAT
I got the monitor to my left that has you guys on it.	CHITCHAT
The chat, you know sometimes a references and then I have a monitor to my right which I just used for references if I need it.	CHITCHAT
Suddenly nice to have three monitors for streaming.	CHITCHAT
One you can do, but it's tough.	CHITCHAT
Two is optimal.	CHITCHAT
For streaming, three says pretty nice bit of a luxury, but Kind of insurers.	CHITCHAT
I'm never really low on space.	CHITCHAT
So we've got a very like angular face.	O
Turczyn, I think it's.	O
Your chin goes.	O
Out a bit more than it should.	O
Carve a bit more into that.	O
She got like a really kind of flat, strong jaw or chin specifically and.	O
Not the look kind of want to have an eroge and but a fairly strong jaw.	O
It's reflected in the.	O
Trying.	CHITCHAT
But matching it to the painting.	O
Can be tough.	O
Sometimes I feel like there's a lot of subtlety.	O
In the face, and like the proportions of the jaw and stuff, so it's really easy to tweak that just slightly when you're translating a drawing into a painting.	O
And it can often times change the whole look and feel of the character.	O
So a lot of times I'll have a character that I feel like it's really.	O
Like I'm happy with the direction of it, the expression, whatever it is.	O
And then I lose it in the painting because it just like a small difference, but.	O
I definitely try to check my.	O
Drawing often while I'm painting so.	O
I'll turn.	CHITCHAT
Turn this off, check my painting, check my drawing, see if it.	O
I'm hitting that same mark visually a lot of times.	O
Actually, what you'll probably see me do is make a duplicate of my drawing and put it off to the left so I don't have to keep turning it on and off.	O
'cause it's nice to be able to see the painting without the drawing and the drawing about the painting because the face looks pretty different to me right now.	O

I'm at the top.	O
And that way when you selected colour it basically selects all the colors of that tone.	O
So you'll see I selected the pants and all the same colors will select there.	O
So if you have really clean flat colors, that's a great way to do it.	O
My colors aren't flat clean.	O
Clean flats so you'll notice like it only selects part of the sleeves and the scroll.	O
'cause those aren't some clean selection, but it is pretty good job.	O
They can always shift Click to grab more tones.	O
But It's pretty quick and easy way to.	O
Grab these towns.	O
So I want to darker.	O
Color for this, but these like white pants, it's.	O
Feel like I kind of need reference.	O
This may not workout well though.	O
White pants.	O
It's not really white pants.	O
Yeah, I'm going to get.	O
I get a bunch of like women's jeans and it's very like studio lighting like that's not.	O
That's not quite what I want, but.	O
I know I have something where where did I get references for that?	O
Let me see if I can find it.	CHITCHAT
What character did I have?	CHITCHAT
White cloth?	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
Is it the brave character?	O
Yeah, that's what it was.	CHITCHAT
This probably isn't the best reference, but it's what I came up with.	O
Anyway, this is kind of like that whitestone.	O
So I could use that as a reference for color if I'm lost.	O
But this town looks to read.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
Something cooler.	O
We can ship that more towards yellow.	O
Well that's too saturated starting to look straight up red.	O
Maybe warmer than that?	O
We're going to cool.	O
I don't know actually this color right here is pretty pretty good and maybe the one I'm looking for.	O
So what I want to do is just sculpt this pants a little bit.	O
And just do like few towns.	O
Can Even so much that just to get this.	O
Sort of shaded look.	O
Thing is, these don't go very deep, so let's go even darker.	O
Make it even cooler.	O
It's too cool.	CHITCHAT
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
And of course, the light tones don't really have the proper light tones.	O
I usually try to find like 3 tones that I can use.	O
That's OK, let's get in there.	CHITCHAT
I'm always trying to simplify though.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And we can do the same thing with her shirt.	O

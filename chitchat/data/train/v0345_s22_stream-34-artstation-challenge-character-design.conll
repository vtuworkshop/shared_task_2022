I'm just trying to like I said, get some basic tones.	O
So that essentially just means a gradient.	O
It's not a bad idea to do like kinda clean gradients are start clean flat colors.	O
For this type of purpose.	O
Wanna try something on the face real quick?	O
I did like.	CHITCHAT
Sort of shadow that I had initially with this.	O
Might be pretty good there.	CHITCHAT
Lost track of what I was doing.	O
Oh no, I lost the colors now silly Maine.	O
It's another.	O
Another painting where I Gotta.	O
Gotta paint cloth.	O
I really need to do some proper cloth studies.	O
'cause fabric and folds and clothing is feel like somewhere I'm a little bit weaker and I'd like to be.	O
Can you metal?	O
I can do leather?	O
But fabric and cloth it gives me a little bit.	O
And when I paint, you can kind of see I'm doing it with this, this chiseled brush.	O
This kind of rectangular brush helps me get these like chiseled edge.	O
Is it really helps me think in terms of form and planar form.	O
I mean like when you're painting, you're supposed to kind of think in terms of planes.	O
And I can always soften it up later, but.	O
Trying to get better at that.	O
But there's an artist who does that really well.	O
His ability to kind of simplify that stuff is.	O
Very effective.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
His name is Sergei cools off.	O
Assuming I'm not.	O
Saying that wrong.	O
You guys don't know him.	O
He did work on dishonored.	O
I think that's where some people know his work from.	O
But the way he simplifies clothing in a very graphic ways, just super, super impressive.	O
So you guys don't know him or pop him up real quick.	O
Looks like he's got some stuff that's in a very different style.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Lately.	CHITCHAT
Let me show you some of the pieces I'm talking about though.	O
Oh funny enough, I didn't even make this connection.	CHITCHAT
You can see the art station link is paling, so his name.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
On Artstation his his URL is Paling.	O
And this brush that I have this rectangular one is called palings brush.	O
So it is actually.	CHITCHAT
This guys brush I don't know if it's the first one or he's the first one who used it, 'cause I think the brush I'm using right now is pretty popular, but I got it from.	O
I horror Pasternak.	O
It was called palings brush, so I'm assuming he got it from this guy.	O

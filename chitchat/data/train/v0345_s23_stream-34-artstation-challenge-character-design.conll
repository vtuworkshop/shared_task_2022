Funny enough, though, was literally talking about chiseled forms with this brush and I was like, Oh, you know who does that?	O
Well and I forgot that it's his brush.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So it's not as apparent here, but he definitely has a lot of these kind of chiseled graphic forms.	O
Really, really cool, but here's some good examples.	CHITCHAT
If I zoom in on these.	CHITCHAT
This painting is amazing.	CHITCHAT
Like his ability to do these graphic reads with the folds in the fabric along with the texture is just.	O
Super well done like look at that.	O
It's pretty much just.	O
It's almost like 3 values in a way.	O
In some areas this deep shadow is the light and it's kind of his lighter shadow that.	O
Is within the light area.	O
But if you look at it as folds, they're very kind of graphic.	O
Same thing here.	CHITCHAT
I love that this character leaned over.	O
You get a couple of these like.	O
Graphic folds in the fabric almost looks like low Poly.	O
But it's like he just puts his enough information like no more values are rendering that he needs to.	O
It just works so well.	O
And the way this fabric is like hard edged graphic, it's like you don't need softness for fabric to read.	O
Which is something I'm kind of telling myself right now.	O
Like a lot of times when I'm doing fabric all think well, you know, if I soften up the edges and I blended together, it'll look more like cloth, which is true to some degree because.	O
Admittedly like these.	O
These objects look a little bit harder because of that, but it still reads is like pants and cloth.	O
So you don't need that.	O
You can definitely use that.	O
Just a reminder to Maine.	O
You can keep it graphic and still have it look great, so here's a good example.	O
A graphic read of those folds in the fabric.	O
It's very minor plane changes like very minor value changes to indicate that plane change, like here on the back where my cursor is kind of tracing over that shows like a bit of a fold, a bit of a wrinkle.	O
Maybe it's contouring to their back muscle a little bit, but it's not like a dramatic shift in value.	O
It's very noticeable, but it's not like black and white.	O
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Like you can get very minor value differences to make the folds more subtle.	O
And here's the last one will do I don't know if this one is is good for the folds, but.	O
It's an amazing painting.	CHITCHAT
Zoom in on that guys sleeve, yeah?	CHITCHAT
Which is on point.	CHITCHAT
How are you so good?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, good stuff.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, back to it.	CHITCHAT
Essentially, I guess my point there is something I'm going to try to keep in mind.	O
Like just trying to get these reads to come as.	O
Loosely and quickly as possible is the goal.	O
So I just selected the blue.	O
That's why a lot of these blue tones are allowing me to draw on them.	O
I may like make a.	O
Inspiration sheep.	O
A reference sheet of surgical South.	O
To try to channel his.	O
Channel his fabric.	O
So you can get.	O
You can get some nice like.	O
Subtle wrinkles like that's what I'm trying to do here.	O
I don't know if it's too subtle.	O
With like these subtle form changes, they don't need to be.	O
Super dramatic or anything.	O
But I don't necessarily want these stylized sharp edges in fabric, but it's like if I can get that from the get go in a simplified way.	O

It probably be a lot easier to smooth it out as much or as little as I want.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
This looks kind of good to Maine.	CHITCHAT
In terms of actual like finish.	O
Pretty.	CHITCHAT
Pretty enamored with.	O
Piada Jablonski's fabric.	O
And you know a good thing.	O
And this is probably would have been.	O
A good idea to do is to do the flat colors first.	O
And then duplicate it like I did.	O
Basically duplicated so I can still use this layer for flat selections, which I can now I haven't gotten rid of that yet, but it may be worth.	O
Like before I merge these together 'cause I got these two layers.	O
So Luckily I can still grab my magic wand.	O
And what I can do?	CHITCHAT
Is not have the painting layer selected, but have that flat color layer select and this is how it used to work a lot.	O
But I could just grab those flat selections.	O
It's sample all layers right now, so let's turn that off.	O
So there we go now grabs just the blue section, but you know it's more cleaned up, it helps.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I should lock this layer for sure.	O
And then I will paint.	O
It's Golden area.	O
Put a little more red in there when you go cooler in the shadows.	O
This is a big thing for yellow.	O
I know a lot of people when they do yellow shadows it turns very green and ugly.	O
'cause If you just add black to yellow it's super super apparent.	O
You don't want to just add black to any color.	O
But you're definitely going to.	O
You know if you mix black paint into yellow paint, it turns a nasty green color, and that's because you need to darken it down and cool it down to assuming it's a warm light source.	O
It's going to get cooled down, so I also go a little bit more saturated, so I'll go more towards red away from yellow.	O
You can get a nice shadow that way.	O
That's a really deep shadow, but we can try getting something just a little bit more.	O
Little bit more towards orange.	O
Just a little bit cooler, since Orange is still warm, but it's cooler than yellow.	O
Red is still warm, but it's cooler than orange.	O
We're shifting it away into.	O
The Reds in the Purples.	O
I feel like I have that Sergey Kolesov like fabric in my head now, like I'm trying to get some.	O
Some life I gotta, I gotta finish one sentence before I start another.	O
I feel like I.	O
Want to get those like planar changes even in fabric?	O
That's kind of.	O
Not super folded, but then I was just thinking about if you're going to be doing these planner changes you gotta think about how the fabric would fold.	O
Like where these?	O
Tension points, so probably be like that.	O
Hey, what's up Dave?	CHITCHAT
Hum posting art station from be Hans I'm going to cry.	CHITCHAT
What do you mean?	CHITCHAT
Oh, do you mean like a different portfolio website?	CHITCHAT
Yeah well, not everyone has a.	CHITCHAT
Has a B hands profile.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if paling does but artstation like everyone's on artstation in terms of.	CHITCHAT
Like concept artists, the game industry people, art stations definitely geared towards that.	CHITCHAT

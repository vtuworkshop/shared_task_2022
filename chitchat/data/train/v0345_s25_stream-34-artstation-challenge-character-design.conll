So everyone like kind of in the game industry has one of those.	CHITCHAT
I know some artists who I follow you have a big hands but.	CHITCHAT
Definitely not everyone, I'm just bad is updating my stuff in general.	CHITCHAT
I haven't updated my artstation awhile.	CHITCHAT
I do have my Behance updated.	CHITCHAT
I did that.	CHITCHAT
With my heart station, no one.	CHITCHAT
Look at my artstation it's really.	CHITCHAT
It's really out of date.	CHITCHAT
I've always been kind of bad at keeping my stuff updated.	CHITCHAT
Portfolios website all that but.	CHITCHAT
I need to get better at it.	CHITCHAT
I need to start pretending I'm a professional.	CHITCHAT
Just messed around.	CHITCHAT
I know game designers are all in art station, which is what you're saying.	CHITCHAT
Is it?	CHITCHAT
Yeah exactly.	CHITCHAT
Do you remember?	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you were around back in the time of a CG hub that used to be the big place back in the day.	CHITCHAT
CG hub with the King for awhile for that like industry and then see who died.	CHITCHAT
I forget if they just couldn't keep up with the servers or what happened.	CHITCHAT
Something happened where they shut it down.	CHITCHAT
Which was really unexpected for a lot of people I know.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of like what I do now.	CHITCHAT
I know a lot of people had their.	CHITCHAT
Basically inspiration Gallery of work saved on CG hub.	CHITCHAT
So like everyone was on it back then.	CHITCHAT
So if you had an artist you liked.	CHITCHAT
You kind of like save peoples work on that site.	CHITCHAT
But Once it got shut down.	CHITCHAT
Everyone kind of lost those like catalogs of work they were saving from artists they like and.	CHITCHAT
That's something I guess I should be afraid of.	CHITCHAT
'cause I didn't do that with CG hub as much as I recall, but I definitely do that with art station like Artstation is how I save work.	CHITCHAT
I'll find people on there.	CHITCHAT
Or sorry, I'll find work on there that I really like and all.	CHITCHAT
Save it on artstation.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I'll go back and look at it.	CHITCHAT
I need to look it up.	CHITCHAT
I'll be like I was that piece that I saved that was really cool.	CHITCHAT
I can just search.	CHITCHAT
I do keep inspiration folders on my.	CHITCHAT
Computer, though I do that too.	CHITCHAT
Let me see here.	CHITCHAT
I think I have some.	CHITCHAT
I think I have some references for the pants.	O
So I'm going back to my other layer using the magic wand tool to grab that whole section of blue and going back to my paint layer.	O
To paint on top of it, no.	O
OK, so there we go.	CHITCHAT
Good old photo shop selection tools.	O
Alright, let's get a little save.	O

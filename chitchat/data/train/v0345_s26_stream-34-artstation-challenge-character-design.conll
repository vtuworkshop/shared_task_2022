Installed new graphics driver when I was refreshing Chrome my computer crashed.	CHITCHAT
Oh no.	CHITCHAT
Was typing I don't know CG hub.	CHITCHAT
OK, so you already rebooted.	CHITCHAT
That was pretty quick.	CHITCHAT
My computer takes like half an hour to reboot, it's crazy.	CHITCHAT
I knew quarrel, flott, and verb before that digital art.	CHITCHAT
Common shadow nest com man.	CHITCHAT
OK, I don't know any of those.	CHITCHAT
I literally haven't heard of.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I mean Digital Art.	CHITCHAT
Com, it sounds like it's such a generic name, but I don't think I recall that website.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's like different communities 'cause I know there's a lot of different dishes.	CHITCHAT
There's like the game industry.	CHITCHAT
There's animation sites you know, or if it's just like a different time.	CHITCHAT
But I don't really get into art until 2008 and I went on to conceptart.org when I first started.	CHITCHAT
That was kind of the place to be back then, so if it's before 2008, that's probably why I wouldn't know them.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to pop up.	CHITCHAT
Sergey Kolesov again 'cause.	CHITCHAT
Feel like, feel like I want to look at.	CHITCHAT
Have those up as a reference.	CHITCHAT
This is such a stylized piece compared his stuff.	CHITCHAT
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
The man's too good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think those are the ones that was pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Very loose.	CHITCHAT
Just to keep these shapes this way of thinking in my head, this is a really good one right here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think this ones that really solid example.	CHITCHAT
If you guys don't know.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's just an RP Orange Oblonsky.	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
His his fabrics just insane.	CHITCHAT
I mean, there's not a lot of great examples, but his edges.	CHITCHAT
I mean, this is one of my favorite artists.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have seen my streams before.	CHITCHAT
He definitely has some stylization like this one.	CHITCHAT
But The way he paints.	CHITCHAT
Star was in awe of it.	CHITCHAT
Popping up some good fabric ones.	CHITCHAT
What do I have in mind?	CHITCHAT
I had an image mad, I just lost it.	CHITCHAT
I know right now I'm getting too deep down the rabbit hole.	CHITCHAT
What is the?	CHITCHAT
Fabric I'm thinking of.	CHITCHAT
I had it then I lost it.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, yeah of course.	CHITCHAT
With my favorite painting of his.	CHITCHAT
I think this is also dishonored.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's from dishonored like this, so the texture and the folds in the softness Lee It's perfect.	CHITCHAT
It's perfect, it's so good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's too much.	CHITCHAT
Get so much contrast in it.	CHITCHAT
But I mean, that's like a staple of Peter Jablonski's work is is contrast is just insane.	CHITCHAT
Just so crisp, it's so good anyway.	CHITCHAT

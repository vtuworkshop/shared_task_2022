Drawn out each pose, so I think I closed it.	O
Pop it back open.	O
So here are these six character sketches I did initially.	O
They each have a.	O
There's a story behind it, but I don't have the time to kind of recap.	O
But these are the six the poses we're going to be using.	O
And now it's basically going in drawing each one with their costume that we've designed in a separate document and then painting them out so she'll have a box beneath her kind of left it out, but.	O

I think wow time flies and I really wish and I really hope actually that all of my previous life stream kind of help you in some ways in terms of photo editing you know colored eating how to remove background?	CHITCHAT
How would you walk things and.	CHITCHAT
Today we're going to see something knew it should be something fun an.	CHITCHAT
I thought of adding in few characters.	CHITCHAT
As you can see from the title is called Willie and friends and who's really and whether the friends you get to see in a bit and this photo manipulation that we're going to create right after this, a space on one of the photo reference that I saw on the Internet yesterday.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if you guys have seen.	CHITCHAT
Lion King if you remember the poster where there's a sign sunset, everything is so so beautiful I thought would be nice to recreate that scene but.	CHITCHAT
In a different way where I have a bunch of characters that I would like to create an kind of tell a story like you all know from my Instagram right, I like creating stories an will be nice to create.	CHITCHAT
That's in an yeah I can't wait far before I start let me just show you the reference image and let me quickly switch to my.	CHITCHAT
What he called browser so that you can have a look at the reference.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
So I'm sure you've seen this image posters by the roadside billboards everywhere during The Lion King launch, and I want to create this kind of colors for this photo manipulation.	CHITCHAT
An yeah, let's get started.	O
I am going to start off by adding in all the images.	O
Write an as you all know, before even ice slide, I like to create all this.	O
Composition first before I go in and edit and those watching online.	O
Hope you enjoyed the stream and do let me know if the audio and everything is clear so that I know I'm actually talking to you guys not like alone, right?	O
Cool, Sushant is saying Good Morning Revision.	CHITCHAT
A good morning.	CHITCHAT
Hey I saw your email.	CHITCHAT
I will actually explained life.	CHITCHAT
I think that it will be easier in that way so that other people know as well.	CHITCHAT
So during the end of the session you get to see the answer for your email.	CHITCHAT
I think you sent me an email right?	CHITCHAT
Like couple of days ago and I'm going to reply that an let's just start.	O
Um, of course we always start with the background and then until the foreground right, so we're going to start off by placing a sunset image.	O
So if this beautiful sunset image, sure.	O
So as you can see, my canvas is wider because I feel characters to add in.	O
There you go, I'll just place it like this again.	O
We will do adjustment later.	O
For now I'll just leave it like this.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
And I am going to.	O
And in other characters, uhm?	O
I also have this Cliff.	O
Right, I'm not sure why most of my manipulation involved Cliff.	O
There's something in Cliff I don't know.	O
So I'm going to just place it, uh?	O
Here again, just a rough 1 first.	O
Enlarge it and then move it down.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
We will do all the editing later on, right?	O
So we're going to just reduce the opposite E like we always do so that we can see the different audios clearly.	O
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Awesome, thanks to shine.	CHITCHAT
And we have the UM.	O
So import in the characters.	O
Right now it's the background, so I go in for in the bear so there is one of the character.	O
So if you're wondering who's V just wait and see.	O
I'm going to reduce the.	O

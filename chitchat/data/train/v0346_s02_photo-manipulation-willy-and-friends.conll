Papa city I'll just place it there, probably enlarge it a bit.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
Send me there.	CHITCHAT
Maybe in logic even more.	O
OK, I think that's good.	CHITCHAT
I also have another character.	O
A Tiger.	O
So this is like based on the.	O
I'm sure you guys watch Jungle Book before though.	O
So Jungle Book Mowgli all that so I can inspire from it.	O
So I'm taking this.	O
Look and feel of a Lion King and at all be nice to tell a story.	O
Why are my own?	O
Imagination, which is not really Mowgli.	O
Mowgli in this UM thing you have a character called really an who's really how he looks like.	O
You have to wait and see right now I'm just positioning as you can see.	O
Right and positioning the.	O
The bird, the Tiger.	O
OK, so I'm going to reduce the opposite of Tiger very quickly.	O
I also have some.	CHITCHAT
Ow.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
They are all friends, and if you're wondering why is the owl?	O
Moving downwards like as if it's going to, it's the value will know in a bit.	O
Of this reduced the opposite day or it quickly.	O
With that one and.	O
Maybe around there.	O
OK, I'll just leave it for a bit.	O
And I am going to import.	O
The main character of this photo manipulation was really.	O
Presenting, we whoops my bad.	O
There you go, that's really.	O
I'll just input at once.	O
More they go.	O
That is really.	O
Really will be the main character for this manipulation.	O
You also learn how to draw stuff on really right?	O
So I'm going to just.	O
Make it horizontal.	O
And I'm going to just zoom in.	O
And I'm going to.	O
Reduce the opposite of BB.	O
So that I know where to position him.	O
They re size.	O
Enough to scale out to see them out to see.	O
How big really supposed to be?	O
Thank you, I think that might work.	O
Let me zoom in and see if we can always adjust it later.	O
This is just a rough composition anyway, right?	O
Perfect yeah, that will do so now I am going to.	O
Adjust something, for example, he's looking up, but all is at the site.	O
Let me just move out like this.	O
Perfect and I'm going to move the overall images downwards a bit so that we have more angles of the.	O
How?	CHITCHAT
Can you bring in the old again down here?	O
OK, let's prefer.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's zoom out a little more because I really wanted the Cliff to be seen right.	O
So I can resize this converse.	O
Choose like.	CHITCHAT
That Perfect comes due sumbing.	O
OK, that's perfect OK.	O
This left hand side you can just leave it first.	O
We will figure out how to crop, it out or something for now.	O
I'm happy with this composition and of course.	O
We will start by dropping all this images.	O
We will start off with the Cliff.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
This clip we have here I'd images press W for quick select selection and I am going to.	O
Musket, of course it's not so.	O
Well done there so I'm going to just fix that.	O
Very quickly, let me zoom out to see if all the angles is selected perfect and we just need to mask it.	O
OK, once you musket.	O
You can just leave it first, because we're going to go in and color and everything right.	O
And next we have the mirror.	O
I'll just, um, increase the opposite.	O
Be there you go and press on W.	O
And first unselect subject.	O
Let's see if everything is selected.	O

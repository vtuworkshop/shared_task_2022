Everything looks good.	CHITCHAT
OK we will just um musket.	O
As you can see I won the bear to be above the Cliff, so it makes sense for me to just move this down this layer so that I can hide the lakes.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
I am going to actually finish in logic, so I just leave it first for now.	O
And I'm going to bring in the Tiger.	O
And time to prop Tiger out.	O
Perfect just like as if they're talking, and if you're wondering what are you talking about, I'll tell you a story right after this.	O
And I'm going to just press W again.	O
Press like subject.	O
Perfect, but we still have a bit of cleaning to do, some using.	O
The Polygonal Lasso.	O
To do this, select this area because I don't need this white Patch over here.	O
OK, everything looks good over here.	O
A bit more soldiers fresh if I want this to be selected as well.	O
Show me guys saying hi and finally able to join a perfect.	O
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
And I am going to musket.	O
OK, so we have bear.	O
We have the Tiger and.	O
We have the old baby.	O
I'll do the large one and I'm going to start off.	O
Is continuing the owl.	O
So first one W.	O
Press on, select some jerk.	O
Let's see if the old is selected.	O
A bit of redefining to do, but I can this be doing it?	O
We need to select the feet so press L perceive.	O
Hope you guys enjoying so far.	O
Right now we are edging out all the stock images.	O
Chris Chef so that I can select this.	O
Part of the owl.	O
You do just like this.	O
Perfect OK.	CHITCHAT
Oho abit more the table so let's go in and.	O
Create this.	O
OK, perfect and we can.	CHITCHAT
Actually.	CHITCHAT
Musky.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So in this manipulation I'm I'm creating a storyline right like 4.	O
For this you can see the title.	O
There is really inference, so really is the baby here we.	O
Equal until Mowgli from Jungle Book.	O
But I have my own character.	O
I would like to use him as main character of this formulation.	O
Write his name is really that's why I named it.	O
Who I am going to select subject to see if he selected perfect.	O
OK, I'm going to press on masking.	O
OK, that's another thing for you guys, right?	O
Like for example, if you see the edges.	O
If it's not so clean or is very soft right after, you must get his way to clean it up.	O
Click on the baby.	O
Or whichever masking area, right?	O
The black spot.	O
Click on select and mask.	O
You'll see at the site case called feather right.	O
Uhm, what you going to do is you just increase the contrast.	O
Then you have a sharp edges around the baby.	O
So look at the baby here I'm going to zoom into the baby and you get to see the edges of the baby become more sharper after I increase the contrast.	O
Can you see that now it's too sharp, so I'm going to reduce that a bit.	O
2.	O
Here so that it's not so soft.	O
Perfect and I'm liking it.	O
And we have to do all the color edit style.	O
Of course we will use the color look up right, but.	O
Again, we will start off with anything.	O
The Clippers.	O
So again, I want the synth look like those Lion King poster, right?	O
You know, this, like orangey sunset will be nice to have that intensity in this.	O
Write an I am going to start off by some color balance.	O
So let me open up calibre lens.	O
Just drag this up here.	O
Musket.	O
And let's increase the red.	O
And at the same time increase the yellow.	O
So now you can slowly see how the.	O

The background and the foreground works right.	O
See without this color balance, it's in grayscale mode like as in his tone down.	O
So just increase the red and yellow.	O
We will do more edits into this later.	O
We just going to create this first step of editing the colors.	O
Let's call this.	O
Clip.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Next we have the better.	O
Same thing, color balance.	O
Um, make sure your musket and you increase the rib.	O
And yellow at the same time.	O
So that everything matches up.	O
There are questions before this were like can we reuse all this color balance and just add on through all these subjects that we have in photo manipulation?	O
I don't think so.	O
You can reason is be'cause.	O
Um the surface and the background, the texture is different so each of these subjects will have their own levels or colors that we need to adjust manually to each one of this so we cannot reuse.	O
OK, as you can see this a problem here.	O
The edges is too rough.	O
We will clean it up later.	O
OK, this is just the first step.	O
I have the Tiger.	O
As you can see, the Tiger is not so sharp for some reason.	O
We will make it sharper than real Japanese first grade shop in this press on shopping.	O
OK, that works with this too much.	O
What I'm going to do is I am going to duplicate.	O
The Tiger an remove the shop and above.	O
And I'm going to just reduce the opposite is that I have a bit of.	O
What do you call sharpness?	O
Not so much and I'll just make this too, as smart logic called Tiger and we will now edit the color.	O
Hololens.	O
I'm sure you must get increase the red.	O
And the yellow.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
As you can see, Tiger is pretty.	O
Right, that's why we can reuse all this caliber lens, right?	O
So that's perfect.	CHITCHAT
We create the debt.	O
And next, we're going to go to the owl.	O
We go.	O
I'm going to come.	O
Group disrespect quickly, let's call it.	O
Tiger.	O
Cliff is there.	O
Let's call this bear.	O
And I'm going to.	O
Adjust the color balance of this al.	O
So there is a bit reddish and go that works.	O
We probably need to move the owl Moto due to its left bites.	O
OK, we will adjust it later.	O
Group this quickly.	O
Let's call it.	O
Oh, and we have the baby baby is just too far because it's sunset I think would be nice to just dumped on him and his method to duck.	O
And as you can see in my Instagram right all those babies.	O
How do I darken the man?	O
I just color and stuff like that.	O
This power do it.	O
I usually duplicate.	O
The layer of the baby and I change the blending mode to multiplying.	O
Now you see what happened to the baby, right is?	O
Is like three turns that, again, there's many ways to do this.	O
You can even use brightness.	O
Just decrease the brightness.	O
Or you can even use the human saturation, the lightness.	O
Decrease it by kind of like this method because it I feel the texture in maintains is just darken it.	O
But of course I won't leave it too.	O
Just like that.	O
I will usually go to image adjustment and I'll usually change it to black and white and I want you to look at the baby right now.	O
You get back the natural tone of the baby.	O
Right let me just show you before, and after, so look at the baby right now.	O
After we multiply is just too intense and we gonna just make sure that we get back their skin color, but he looked darker, so in order in order to do that.	O
You just need to change it to black and white and you can see the difference right preview.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
An we will just quickly group the baby.	O
Let's call it.	O
BB and let's do a bit of masking.	O
Going here.	O
Because the baby is sitting on a bear, it makes sense for me to musket.	O
So in order to do masking, I'll usually reduce the opposite team.	O
OK I am going to change my brush.	O
I'm going to increase a bit more.	O

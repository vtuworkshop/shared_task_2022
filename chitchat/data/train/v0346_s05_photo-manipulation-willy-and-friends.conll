Can't really see the baby now.	O
OK, I'm going to just.	O
Brush the baby.	O
I'm going to zoom in again.	O
OK, there's a bit of hand are we can just leave it.	O
OK, um I'm going to.	O
Here is this part of the baby.	O
They go.	CHITCHAT
Done, it is a bit of the blue tint.	O
That's because he was sitting on a chair, so I need to remove that.	O
So what I'm doing right now is, I'm just masking removing all the unwanted.	O
I just from the baby.	O
They go like that.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
Let's zoom in a bit more.	O
Remove that.	O
How are you guys?	O
It's weekend, what's your plan?	O
Boy, I remind you that I won't be going.	O
Life next week the whole week I am.	O
I'll be away.	O
For a short Holiday Inn, I'll be back the week after.	O
OK, let's just bump up.	O
The opposite is so that I can see the baby.	O
OK, I probably need to remove this part of the hand.	O
I think there's this, they go.	O
And I'm going to also remove.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Perfectly getting somewhere.	CHITCHAT
Then I'm going to remove this part of the body.	O
We don't need that.	O
Again, he's not wearing anything later on we will Draw Something and then we will add clothes.	O
To this really, really is the characters name.	O
Is.	CHITCHAT
So I'm inspired by two movies here, Lion King for the background.	O
And, Uh, Mowgli from The Jungle Book.	O
Baby don't have a hair really don't have a hair sorry we will add her as well.	O
Cool, we have eight people watching online.	CHITCHAT
Hello to H1 of you.	CHITCHAT
It's going here.	CHITCHAT
And adjusted.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, looks good.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
We will probably need to mask him or let me see.	O
Yeah, we haven't do the color balance sheet for him, so we will increase.	O
We could add in the colour balance.	O
Quickly, let's make sure we musket increase the rat.	O
And yellow.	O
Dude, perfect.	CHITCHAT
Space.	O
OK, we have ahead and we need to add into the baby but we will do that in a bit.	O
And before we do that now that we fix the colors, we will now drop in the color look up so that we get to see how the color looks up.	O
Look up overall.	O
So we're going to just go through the 3D Lutes and I'm going to choose edgy Ember.	O
And I want you to look at the photo manipulation now.	O
Right, my canvas is rooted, slightly Dave.	O
That's perfect and you can see how the colors look like now.	O
Right, it's very very The Lion King style.	O
Let me just move.	O
Sorry, so include to see which.	O
And she works.	O
OK, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to.	O
Slowly adjust certain things in this manipulation, for example.	O
Let's find out where that light comes from first for me, like I can actually draw it up so that you guys can see.	O
I feel like the light should come from here.	O
Let me just draw that.	O
A light.	O
For me.	O
The light.	O
Hope it will be nice to have it yet, so imagine here's the sunlight all.	O
He is actually at the bag, but I kinda like this.	O
So we're going to have like a tint of colors in front of the.	O
Characters right.	O
For example, this area will be duck.	O
Right the front sight.	O
Will be brighter.	O
That's why I'm thinking again, I don't know about you change my mind later.	O
Right, so that's where the sun comes from.	O
And start off.	O
I going to fix the Tiger.	O
So look at the Tiger an.	O

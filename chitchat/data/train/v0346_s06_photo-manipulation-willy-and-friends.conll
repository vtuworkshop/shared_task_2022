Let's see how we can change it.	O
Like for example, I'll just create a new layer.	O
And I am going to come paint over the Tiger.	O
Let me choose a soft brush and I'm going to change to normal.	O
I'm not going to do the soft light for now.	O
And I'm going to reduce the flow even more.	O
And let's call this.	O
Shadow And I am going to just.	O
Brush Just like this.	O
Over the Tiger again, I know the light is coming from the meth inside.	O
I'll just do this.	O
So what I'm doing is I'm doing manually painting.	O
'cause I know this area will be dug.	O
And let's just do this.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Getting there.	CHITCHAT
And I'll just later on before I finished editing the Tiger, I will drop in this.	O
So flight where I will.	O
Just duct in the area.	O
This side of the.	O
So those are watching online, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Send Seven of you guys.	CHITCHAT
Hi.	CHITCHAT
So what are we doing right now?	CHITCHAT
Is we're creating a characters?	O
For the scene.	O
As you can see, the manipulation is called million friends.	O
OK, I'm going to.	O
And in soft light.	O
So this is a soft shadow.	O
In our how am I going to do that?	O
I am going to just.	O
Create ingredient if you watch my previous.	O
Streams you get to see this.	O
And I'm going to change this to soft light and just.	O
Drop the color like that.	O
Can you see that?	O
Right, it's just dropping the color.	O
Like that N.	O
We will must get so that it doesn't reach the front side.	O
So let me change my brush or something big.	O
And let's remove.	O
This part of the.	O
So flight.	O
'cause I want this area to be.	O
Really intense because the sunlight is coming from the left hand side.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Nice see, without all this.	O
Let's see how it looks like, right?	O
123 boom.	O
So the more you add edits to it, the more really we're going to look like.	O
Perfect and we will create like Shadow and stuff like that.	O
We will do that in a bit.	O
I'm I'm going to create more of edit.	O
I'm going to create a new layer called this color Dodge.	O
Oh no, we call it a harsh.	O
Bye.	CHITCHAT
So we will just musket.	O
And I'm going to color pic from the canvas itself there.	O
Come let me see if I can increase.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
And now.	CHITCHAT
I'll change my normal blending mode to color Dodge.	O
And I'm going to just color it.	O
At the edge of the Tiger.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
Can you see the shop lines?	O
Right, so when I do that then it's more visible.	O
There you go.	O
Like this, I'll paint it onto the Lake.	O
I going to reduce the flow of Pedmore.	O
And I'm going to just.	O
Salary here.	O
And at the till.	O
OK, like this and there.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Fire more edits to do the years.	O
And maybe a bit here.	O
But not so much.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Perfect N.	CHITCHAT
To give a final touch to the Tiger, what you can do is you can always increase the brush.	O
Decrease the flow and just drop the color like this.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
That works.	CHITCHAT
OK, now we're going to add in the shadow for the Cliff on the Cliff right of the Tiger, but we need to fix the Clippers very quickly.	O

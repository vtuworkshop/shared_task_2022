I'm going to go back to Cliff.	O
And I'm going to multiply the clips, so here's what I'm going to do.	O
I'm going to just drag and create a new layer, make sure I.	O
Must.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
And I'll just multiply it.	O
So when you multiply you can see how intense is the click right by this is too much for my liking.	O
I'm going to reduce.	O
To that, and let's see before and after.	O
That's perfect.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not so much bit more Lego.	O
So we're going to fix the harsh shadows first, so let's go up here.	O
Call, let's call this shadow.	O
Perfect I'm going to save my.	O
Work, let's call it really, very quickly and time to add in shadows.	O
So let's switch my pellet to black.	O
An normal is fine, So what I'm doing is I'm going to just duck in this area.	O
As increase the flow of it.	O
Actually, I rather take this shadow freed up right above.	O
And I'll just must keep this way.	O
Right above so that I don't do it.	O
So what I'm doing is if I had the schedule right above this color, look up is.	O
What is doing is that is just adding the shadow within this layer, not this one.	O
Because this is multiply.	O
That's why you can see so much of the shadow.	O
So I drag the shadow up.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
There's The Shadow and I want to reduce the shadows intensity.	O
I'm going to add in bit of like.	O
Shadows here.	O
Um, that's perfect.	CHITCHAT
People may be a bit.	O
Pop up here.	O
In a bit of the down here.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
That works.	CHITCHAT
And now I am going to add in shadow.	O
Of the Tiger, we can do manual way.	O
I love doing them a new way of creating shadows.	O
So let's go back.	O
Appear, let's call it.	O
Tigers Shadow Perfect.	O
Make sure your musket.	O
And I'm going to use.	O
My favorite tool is which is called the Polygonal Lasso.	O
To roughly create the what do you call the shadow of the Tiger?	O
So here's what I'm doing.	O
I'm going again.	O
This is based on my own imagination.	O
I'm imagining that Azure.	O
Shadow looks like this and following their head.	O
And the body and everything.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
A bit more.	O
Like that you don't have to worry, can always adjust it later.	O
So let's just.	O
Drop this, they go like that.	O
Maybe more intense.	O
Let's do that one more time they go.	O
OK, and I want you to copy that.	O
It's like I'll copy and paste it on top of the similar so that you get more intense.	O
Which are you?	O
Multiply it.	O
Qualifier Schedule again.	O
How do you think you wouldn't say Hi?	CHITCHAT
Good Morning bro.	CHITCHAT
Hi Kathy, Good Morning.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining.	CHITCHAT
And what I'm going to do is I am going to just group this.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Shadow And I'm going to convert it to a smart object.	O
Let's go T shadow.	O
Keep the Tiger and I'm going to do some blurry effects to it, but for now I'm going to do adjustment.	O
Again, I don't know how far is the sunset when it's happening, so I'm going to just adjust.	O
The shadow.	O
Myself by my lonely like this.	O
It can be too much.	O
Again, I don't know um.	O
Let's quickly basket.	O
And change my brush.	O
And I'm going to just erase this, but.	O
Assuming here.	O
This at in.	O
We need to add in more of the.	O
Shadow all the Tiger.	O
For now I am happy with this.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to go to the Tiger and at in more shadow.	O

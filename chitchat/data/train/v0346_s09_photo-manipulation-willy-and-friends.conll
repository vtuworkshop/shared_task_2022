Yes.	CHITCHAT
We need to adjust.	O
Kartik is saying how to be patience for three to four hours while editing give us tips.	O
A very very good question.	O
Thanks for asking that question kartik.	O
Focus focus is very important when you do work so that you don't carry away.	O
But distracted by like somebody or a sound whatever I usually use my headphone.	O
So it's my friend my good friend, right?	O
For me I just listen to my favorite music and I get my things done an in deep in my heart.	O
I just want to make sure that my art looks good.	O
So all this restriction will start because I cannot say that.	O
Stop it, you know I just want to focus and get it done.	O
Somehow it works.	O
I really spent five hours to get my work done, so you can imagine.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Listen to your favorite music focus just to get things done.	CHITCHAT
Some using this tool to just cleaned up this, the edges of.	O
But even retinas if Dominic broad check my in stoppage.	O
OK, sure.	CHITCHAT
Right after this, is this something important?	O
OK, I'm going to come.	O
Let me see if it's too intense.	O
OK, so I'm just going to go at the edge of this bear.	O
And do a bit of cleanup.	O
As you all know best.	O
What do you call?	O
First 2 can be too fine, so I'm just doing this.	O
To just get back that fur.	O
But we will do more adjustment later.	O
So I'm just going around an adding that edges.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Let's move it up.	O
Danish is saying it's my birthday today and I'm I'm starting my day with photo shop and you are now Oh Wow, Happy Birthday to Dennis Kumar Yoga Morgan.	O
Happy birthday to you.	O
There you go, everybody is wishing you Happy Birthday.	O
May all your dreams come true?	O
I know you been watching my stream for past few stream.	O
Thank you so much for taking time to watch.	O
Again, don't forget people who's watching online.	O
The mantra to get better in anything in what you do.	O
Will be the practice?	O
Always practice.	CHITCHAT
Right, OK, so we have a bit of rough edges on the bear time to clean it up again.	O
I have a few things that I can use.	O
I can use brush that I have sure my tool presets or I can use a manual and.	O
As in a different type of.	O
Brush so I'm going to just dive in and see.	O
What other types of brushes that I can use?	O
Because the fur is too fine.	O
Hugs Drury to say maybe we can collaborate?	CHITCHAT
Please check my work.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, sure.	CHITCHAT
I'll remember your name.	CHITCHAT
Has Rory Dole images?	CHITCHAT
Take note.	CHITCHAT
Ken I'll just have a look at your work.	CHITCHAT
Let's quickly go in and see will there be any type of brush that I can use?	O
2.	CHITCHAT
Adjust they go.	O
I think this might work.	CHITCHAT
For this too much, so here's another tip.	O
In case you don't know, right.	O
For example, I have this.	O
Many types of brushes right?	O
I can actually are very call adjust this brushes.	O
I couldn't find the one I want hold on.	O
I'm looking at it.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking at it.	CHITCHAT
I kinda like this one.	CHITCHAT
But if I brush you can see, right?	O
It's like there's so many different types of brushes in order to control that.	O
I'll just go to the brush here.	O
They go out, press on this icon.	O
Over here I'll get brush settings.	O
You can see down here right this like a spacing and stuff like that and also here you have scattering color dynamics and transfer.	O
And I want you to look at this.	O
I want you to remove the transfer color dynamics and a scattering.	O
Once you do that, you won't be getting the scattering anymore.	O
So you could just get that.	O
Can you see this?	CHITCHAT

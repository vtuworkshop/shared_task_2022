No more scattering there was like a lot of like what we call patchings just now.	O
So I'm going to use this to adjust the.	O
Edges of there.	O
Like that?	O
Reduce my brush.	O
They go.	O
Just like this.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Constantly saying how To Know and how to understand where we want to stop.	O
How everything how to avoid over everything?	O
OK, always set time.	O
For example, when I do my work, I usually tell myself.	O
I only have 5 hours.	CHITCHAT
So when I have only five hours, I need to get it done within five hours left.	CHITCHAT
For example, let's take this live stream.	CHITCHAT
For instance, I have two hours.	CHITCHAT
Right, I need to get this photo manipulation than by 10:00 AM Malaysia time right now is almost 9:00 AM.	CHITCHAT
I know back of my head that I have another one out gohan.	CHITCHAT
I know how to adjust my editing time now.	CHITCHAT
For example for bear I know how long it's going to take so it's all about timing and you need to control that.	CHITCHAT
Don't go beyond 2 three hours 6 hours because you just.	CHITCHAT
Again, you just making too much of anything and then at the end of the day you will be like exhausted.	CHITCHAT
You'd want that you always need to take care of yourself, and if you think it takes more than that, always take a break.	CHITCHAT
Go for lunch.	CHITCHAT
Come back.	CHITCHAT
And then continue everything, right?	CHITCHAT
You will know when to stop anything.	CHITCHAT
And you know it again, I don't know if I'm answering it right, but always set time.	CHITCHAT
I said five hours for each of my artwork.	CHITCHAT
Because if I go beyond that, I go crazy.	CHITCHAT
I'll be just editing and editing, guess what?	CHITCHAT
Whenever I if I do that, I'm just making my telling myself that is going to be a very amazing art.	CHITCHAT
But then once I posted on social media and go live, Oh my God, there's so much of mistake I should've just get it done with my sweet time and then upload it this way also.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like advice to a lot of people that don't rush to work things done.	CHITCHAT
Don't don't rush.	CHITCHAT
If you rush then the other it won't be so good.	CHITCHAT
You will be.	CHITCHAT
A man kind of hard work.	CHITCHAT
Ki, as you can see I'm using the flower type of brush.	O
To clean up my bears fur.	O
Does this still have a bit of you can see, right?	O
So you can actually see it on the stream like the shape of it.	O
So once I press on it.	O
I'm using the edge of the.	O
Flower.	O
And you know, it's not so intense reasons, because up here the flow I reduced it to 30%.	O
Right, I'm just brushing, making sure it's soft.	O
It's very tiny little edit, but it makes a difference, so let's zoom on NC perfect like it.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it OK and don't rush to it.	CHITCHAT
Things like don't rush.	O
That looks good.	CHITCHAT
Denny's What's your plan for today, since it's your birthday?	O
OK, let's hide this.	O
Send over the bear.	O
Just called it down edits.	O
It's going here and choose as.	O
For Clone Stamping I'm going to do a bit of cleaning up.	O
Press alternate and.	O
Go, I don't need this.	O
I don't like this.	CHITCHAT
All this I don't need I don't need.	O
OK, done.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's just hide all this.	O
So right now I'm just clone stamping, trying to remove all this, uhm?	O
Send over the bear.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Networks, no, it's not so much before.	O
This is quite a bit.	O
For example, you can see right?	O
Before and after.	O
So now time to work on the bear.	O
As I said earlier, the light is coming from the left hand side, so it doesn't make sense for the bad to have a very bright light at the site at the back of him.	O
So I'm going to create new lay on top of the where.	O
Let's call it.	O
Shadow Let's just mask it.	O

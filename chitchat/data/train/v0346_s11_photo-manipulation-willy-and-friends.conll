Oops, right?	CHITCHAT
Yes, like that and.	CHITCHAT
Why?	CHITCHAT
Boys in the Cliff.	O
Move that out from the Cliff, then go over again.	O
Time to change my tool to brush.	O
Black an I'm going to just.	O
Do this.	CHITCHAT
Can you see that?	CHITCHAT
Hum, because I know the source of light.	O
Is coming from the front, so I need to make sure that.	O
The back part of him, it's darker.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's drop in a color.	O
Like the light shadow.	O
Make sure your musket.	O
Hello everybody was watching.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to come.	CHITCHAT
Drop in my favorite gradient shadowless, inside this box over here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
That's too much less.	O
Try soft light.	O
Yeah, that works.	CHITCHAT
So now I'm going to adjust.	O
You see I can adjust my shadows.	O
Right, I want to adjust anti here.	O
Let's bring in the shadow, move it up the front.	O
OK, time to brighten up the front light.	O
So I'm going to call this, uhm.	O
Light.	O
As musket.	O
Uhm, OK Cliff, we close it first so that we don't get distracted.	O
I'm going to color pic from the.	O
Manipulation itself, and I'm going to choose a color that it's like this.	O
Make sure I change it to normal too.	O
Soft light and time to brighten up the front part of.	O
The verb.	O
They go like this.	O
We have 13 people watching online.	CHITCHAT
Hello to each one of you.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to go back to light shadow and change to black and I'm going to color.	O
All this but slightly darker legal.	O
'cause I wonder like to come from the front.	O
Anne, let me create another layer, call it a flashlight.	O
This is when I am.	O
Constantly saying please say about who inspire you and how you choose definition color.	O
Well, OK, this I I've I've said a few times before, right uhm.	CHITCHAT
You know who you should look up to.	CHITCHAT
You know who you should get inspired from yourself.	CHITCHAT
That doesn't sound ego at all.	CHITCHAT
Here's the reason why.	CHITCHAT
Do not do not compare yourself with somebody else and say that I wish I could be like that person.	CHITCHAT
Rather than looking at that person, why don't you look at yourself right, for example?	CHITCHAT
How let you been doing designing.	CHITCHAT
Let's say you been designing for like one to two years.	CHITCHAT
Have you ever compare your outlook?	CHITCHAT
What you've done back then and now?	CHITCHAT
If there's any improvement, and that's good if you think you're more or less the same person, then that's wrong.	CHITCHAT
Then you didn't learn something new.	CHITCHAT
You need to get inspired by your own self.	CHITCHAT
For example, what I'd like to do is on my free time I like to look back at what I do.	CHITCHAT
But I've done back then I just look at it and go like that's not a good word.	CHITCHAT
So I'll make sure that today.	CHITCHAT
I spend more time creating things because by doing that then you're not comparing you anybody else.	CHITCHAT
You're comparing to yourself and you will have this guilty Nasinu.	CHITCHAT
You go like I should have to.	CHITCHAT
Just get it done in a better way.	CHITCHAT
I should have spent more time to get things done then you feel guilty that guilty.	CHITCHAT
That feeling of Guiltiness is important to have so that you get better every day.	CHITCHAT
So I asked if you ask me who inspired me.	CHITCHAT
I inspire looking at my own work and I see how far we've come.	CHITCHAT
And how do you choose photo manipulation?	CHITCHAT
It's a random thing that appears in my head.	CHITCHAT
An I'll just remember.	CHITCHAT

Uh.	CHITCHAT
That the visuals that comes in my head and I'll create something.	O
Sometimes it can be just keywords like for example if I'm traveling I'm driving.	O
I saw it like a bird fly in front of me and quickly I look at another side there will be another animal.	O
Anna usually combine those elements into one and I create a concept out of it.	O
It's a very it's very hard thing for me to explain because it's it happens just like this.	O
So what I'm doing right now is I am going.	O
To add in some clothes.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Through his face.	O
Up, sure.	O
Their works.	O
You see, before this the edits was not so.	O
Nice for the bear.	O
His wife, shadows and lights are like the number one important things in photo manipulation.	O
I want you to look at all these edits that I've done.	O
If I just hide all this editing.	O
See how we change the lighting like this is the original light and we.	O
Edit it also we remove.	O
We switched the light to whichever way that everyone.	O
That's the beauty of photo manipulation.	O
You choose what you want.	O
You're able to look like.	O
Perfect, that's good.	CHITCHAT
I probably will add a bit more shadow onto the face 'cause I feel the faces two bright, especially this side here is supposed to be done.	O
Right need to understand the structure or the shape of where is the sunlight.	O
Hits shared here will be Deckard so yeah.	O
And it comes with practice.	CHITCHAT
Watch a lot of movies.	CHITCHAT
Marvel movie fan.	CHITCHAT
So you can actually see the post it back here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I understand, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Kartik.	CHITCHAT
So you need to make sure that you inspired by looking at your own Edward.	CHITCHAT
Never compare your hard work with anybody else because that person has their own way of getting things done.	CHITCHAT
Then is saying going to spend good time with family is beyond the better, yes.	CHITCHAT
Family comes first.	CHITCHAT
Perfect now we going to adjust the baby.	O
In the baby have few items that we're going to add in.	O
We can add in the hair we're going to add in a bit of makeup like as in.	O
More eyebrow, you know, so that it's more intense, more visible, and we probably add pens and a bit of like a necklace or something.	O
I hope you have time you have like.	O
55 minutes more so cool, so we're going to fix the baby, so let's close all this.	O
Let's call this very again.	O
Cliff.	O
We will.	O
Musket later on, Tigers perfect, so next is baby.	O
Let's look at the baby layer.	O
Delete it.	O
OK here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to add in some shadows first.	O
Right above this.	O
OK, so let's choose.	O
Dockal color an.	O
You can see I'm trying to add in.	O
That Shadows behind him.	O
A bit curious.	O
This field can be darker because the face candlelight blocks the lights from coming in.	O
I'm going to just go into your mic.	O
Is.	CHITCHAT
Um is quite a bit darker.	O
He stammered a bit darker reasons because the Bears years is there.	O
OK, but we need to make sure that he look brighter bit so for that we of let's call the shadow.	O
Enjoy what you do guys.	CHITCHAT
He doesn't matter where is photo manipulation or.	O
Cooking or whatever it is.	O
Just enjoy the process.	CHITCHAT
Right, just enjoy doing it, don't rush.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy the process, I think.	CHITCHAT
That what matters don't don't rush things to or don't don't think like oh if I need to make sure I do good so that get good comments I'm so sorry it doesn't work that way.	O
You need to be happy with your work.	O
If anybody else wants to point out if you're not doing good, it's OK.	O
It is from their point of view.	O
Just take good comments and.	O
Other Commission doesn't workout, you just ignore it.	O
So yeah, that's how you get better, right?	O
Don't get too affected by comments.	O
But good comments do things like for example, if they point out saying that shadows is not right, look back at your photo manipulation.	O
If you think that shadow is not right and you know you need to improvise on that.	O
So take good comments.	O
And let's change normal too.	O

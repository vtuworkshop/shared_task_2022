Soft light and time to make the baby rider.	O
OK, I'm trying to brighten up the baby.	O
OK, a bit on the Lake here.	O
Kinda hand obviously, because their hands like the front side Kartik is saying again I have.	O
One later and I tried to bring that idea too real, but I feel to bring.	O
Too real Anne.	O
I'm trying by explaining or cool.	O
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Keep trying, you'll get it.	CHITCHAT
Right particular, say, Good morning forces or Switzerland.	CHITCHAT
I see sorry I need to just plug in the battery.	CHITCHAT
The power.	CHITCHAT
OK, what I'm doing right now is I am with what time is it in Switzerland?	CHITCHAT
Is it known already like Charles over 12?	CHITCHAT
One writing?	CHITCHAT
PM OK, I'm brightening up the baby over.	O
There is really.	O
There you see, without all this light and shadow see what happens.	O
Boom, right?	CHITCHAT
So it's important to do that.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Time to add a bit of shadow at the back of the bird for the kid, right?	O
So I'm going to the bear an I'm going to create a new layer.	O
Call this.	O
Really shadow.	O
And I'm going to change my cursor, answering my tool to be, that's brush press D for black and white.	O
And I'm going to just color.	O
Back 3 three in the morning.	CHITCHAT
Really or Switzerland?	CHITCHAT
God I keep thinking some useful in my bed.	CHITCHAT
Switzerland God OK Wow is one of this place that I want to go.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully I can.	CHITCHAT
3 in the morning while thank you so much for waking up and watching my stream, I'm super super grateful part even.	CHITCHAT
So let's add in more shadow.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Maybe a bit of shadow let's recycle.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Now he looks like he's.	O
Right on top of the bear.	O
OK, like I said earlier again, one more time.	O
Always enjoy your at work right?	CHITCHAT
It's all about having fun and get things done.	CHITCHAT
Don't be too serious.	CHITCHAT
Nothing will get up from here if you're too serious.	CHITCHAT
This is based on my experience.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to change the levels of the Tiger.	O
It's bothering me.	CHITCHAT
It's bothering me, so I'm going to the Tiger.	O
I'm going to just go down here an go-to levels.	O
And press alt and it.	O
And I'm going to adjust.	O
This one.	CHITCHAT
Bagel OK, that's perfect.	O
The levels was not so right.	O
OK, that's good and I am going to come.	O
Before we jump into the OR if you're wondering why is the owl?	O
In the bottom side of the picture, that's the reason behind it, which I forgot to add in the photo manipulation.	O
Maybe I'll edit right after I did the baby, right?	O
So we're going to go back to baby or we call him really?	O
In this manipulation we are going to add her.	O
So I have a stock image.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
We need to borrow the hair from this guy.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let me just switch this, flip it to horizontal.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I need to do some selection on the hair in order to do that, just press on W.	O
And I will just.	O
Select There.	O
I think most of you guys for following me on my Instagram keep asking How do I?	O
How do I merge the hair and the?	O
Person together, this is how I do it.	O
Hopefully you get the idea.	O
This is.	O
Done, I'm just going to select the face.	O
OK and then.	CHITCHAT
Musket.	O
OK, so now we need to fix few things.	O
We need to go back to select and mask.	O
And we need to do some cleanup.	O
So if you do this, it will clean up the edges of the hair.	O
Just like this.	CHITCHAT

OK.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to go in here.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I just going to color this, but to be brighter or let me see something wrong to do to.	O
Yeah, I'm not using brush.	O
Amusing eraser.	O
That works OK.	CHITCHAT
I am going to increase the.	O
Light.	O
OK, I'm going to add it like that.	O
Smoothing out, reducing.	O
But the policing install a message for me.	O
OK, can sure I'll check.	O
OK, I'm adding some light so they look slightly like 3 ish.	O
Lego fear.	O
I'm adding some.	O
So then it doesn't look flight.	O
That's the reason why I'm adding all this.	O
And I'll be here.	O
And also at this site here.	O
There is perfect and stone at more here.	O
For the link I wanna edit this part.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Not too much, just a little.	O
It is going to go in here and.	O
Legal it works.	O
Cool, now he looks like.	O
A boy in the jungle cool.	O
I am going to go back to the eyebrow and I'm going to eat at in more of the shading onto this ice.	O
I think could be better.	O
Uhm, I need assault rush.	O
Let's review this flow.	O
Zoom in here.	O
And more of the light around his eyes.	O
With I shadow.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
That Networks that was.	O
Cool and I'm going to add more of the.	O
Oh yeah, he needs offense.	O
He snoring offense.	O
Let's create a new layer, let's call.	O
This ends in order to draw a pen.	O
And I'll I'll just.	O
Draw.	O
This ring shot so.	O
I'm imagining the shot will be this.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
This this this.	CHITCHAT
This again what I'm doing is I'm just drawing a ship.	O
Of the fence.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
It works OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to just drop in a color.	O
I'll choose a Brown color from Lego.	O
For that works.	O
OK, now he's wearing a pants, so of course we need to color the pens, so just controls that back so that we get there.	O
Um pen selected.	O
Let's choose B.	O
To color pic.	O
From the hard work we will just make my brush softer.	O
And I will.	O
Just add in some light.	O
And I'm going to also change my color to black and add in a bit of light shadow.	O
And make sure that nobody here is darker.	O
Control the ears.	O
Appends is a Brown pants.	O
Perfect, I mean there's not much not so much of details we can answer depends because it can be seen from the.	O
For the zoom out version.	O
It would be nice for him to wear.	O
And there's this.	O
Officially we can add in.	O
You ring.	O

They go and just using brush as increase the intensity.	O
How are you guys?	CHITCHAT
We have 14 people watching online hello.	CHITCHAT
Are you hearing works?	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
Some of you might be us thinking like what if he looks darker than this, you can actually make him darker.	O
What you can do is you can go here.	O
Remember we did multiply.	O
We can actually in W.	O
They go his darker now.	O
And then, um, reduce the opposite key.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Cool well, of course it doesn't make sense because.	O
Because he is actually.	O
Facing the sunset, so let's make him darker, but go back to the masking area here adjusts.	O

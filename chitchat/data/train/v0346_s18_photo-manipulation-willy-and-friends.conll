This as a small object.	O
Let me rotate out this way.	O
Yeah, that's that's perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
So now time to fix the owl.	O
Hum, hum.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to create a new layer.	O
The alcohol this our shadow.	O
B.	CHITCHAT
Let's duck in this area because the light is coming from the left inside, right?	O
So it makes sense.	O
For this, but to be darker.	O
And the phase this spot light here.	O
OK, but we need to switch the light, meaning we need to bring in the light layer.	O
OK, next we will color pic from the outlook itself yellow.	O
We need to increase the brush.	O
Let's call this soft light.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Increase the light.	O
I'm going to bring in more light, actually.	O
What exactly is I'm going to bring in the hash light?	O
Perfect and I'm going to change my normal to color Dutch.	O
So there you go.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Which I.	O
Musket OK.	O
And let's reduce the flow.	O
Again, I don't need too intense.	O
I release the flow.	O
Opposite, I really don't touch opposite is like transparency flow.	O
It's like the intensity.	O
Right, so I'm going to just.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Open it OK.	CHITCHAT
This color, this part of the wings.	O
OK, I'm going to color this part of the wings.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Face not so much.	O
OK, it's coming.	O
It's not so orange either.	O
Also, I'm going to create.	O
More of the color balance and it.	O
Then increase the ribs.	O
OK, that makes more sense.	O
They do so as you can see what's happening now is that.	O
So this is a story right since I have a bit of time to explain.	O
Type, it's like Mowgli.	O
I replace the Black Panther, the Jaguar I think is with Tiger.	O
So the bear I remain.	O
The All is new character.	O
Tiger is a Guardian of the boy called Willie.	O
And the bank is also your friend, just that.	O
The bear is kind of like playful.	O
The Tiger did already say that do not bring really anywhere else.	O
Just keep him at home.	O
But bear was saying no.	O
I need to go for lunch an I want really to join me and they actually found a fish from a River and we want to enjoy the sunset as well.	O
And while sunset is happening, Tiger found out that the ID Cliff and the almost there is also kind of their friend.	O
He was like oh this is a rather than going through the River and get the fish.	O
I can actually grab the fish from the bank now because it's like a less effort and he's.	O
Distracted by the Tiger anyway.	O
So yeah, this is sorry.	CHITCHAT
The boy I am going to increase the color.	O
Me.	CHITCHAT
This group all this baby.	O
Players into one 'cause little get confused, OK, cool.	O
So let's get the overall color adjustment to the Tiger is rated the baby really.	O
Increase the yellow.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Do you like the story with you guys?	O
Perfect, everything looks good.	O
I'm going to do a bit of cropping, right?	O
I think this.	O
Laughing says just to blank.	O
Let's just proceed for cropping and I'm going to just drag.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
You know what I rather use?	O
This.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to just.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That works, so just crop here.	O
Let's see if everything goes smoothly perfect.	O

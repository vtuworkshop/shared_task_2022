Yeah, I'm happy this one.	CHITCHAT
Cool, let's see if I need to adjust anything else.	O
The boy looks good.	O
Is there any more questions?	CHITCHAT
We can actually add a bit of tint, bright sent.	O
On top True.	O
We can actually.	O
Just feel watching online if you find this useful.	O
Give me a thumb spot.	O
Thumbs up so that I know I'm doing good job.	O
Or if there's anything you want me to create, or improvised will let me know.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Cool, I am going to just drop a color.	O
On top, just like that and do a bit of like blending to see.	O
If.	O
My manipulation can be a bit brighter.	O
Oh yes.	CHITCHAT
She says, and he has a dog.	CHITCHAT
Yes, Ken.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
It's a very good question actually.	O
So see most of you guys seen me working on this right?	CHITCHAT
Like the human saturation color balance adjustment layer and there's also another tool that you guys can use.	O
Let me see if I can use onto the owl.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Down here this also a blending options.	O
So this blending options are like this.	O
This are bevel that contour texture.	O
All this usually useful like those text effects like Blozan.	O
You want to do a drop shadow but guess what?	O
You can also use it for photo manipulation.	O
So out of all this like Belleville stroke inner shadow stuff like that I like to use setting so I want you to click on settings and I want you to look at the owl.	O
Can you see the altar?	O
Yeah, this part of my screen.	O
Look at it said in, before and after.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Setting helps me in terms of like lighting.	O
For example, if the shadow is coming from the back, and I know this part of the face will be dukharan this outline of me will be brighter, so I should I use that and I can also do a manual fixing by brushing all this my face to be a darker shade and then right here.	O
But there's also a shortcut by seldom use this, it kind of work for small objects.	O
But yeah, let me just show you how it works.	O
Let's go to the setting and you can see multiply.	O
You can see how the out looks like.	O
You can even invert.	O
Look at the invert here.	O
See that you can even this is the Magic by move things around.	O
Right, I hope you're looking at this.	O
You can see how my shadows are moving.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
I can even use this photos photo manipulation.	O
I can even do distancing.	O
Right, how much area I want?	O
I can also change the shape of the setting.	O
Under control here you can press and see how it changes.	O
Right most the time is the first one, but yeah, you can adjust the size.	O
How does one see how sharp you in the shadows to be and whether or not?	O
So yeah, right now I'm using setting.	O
I'm using the multiply.	O
This is 100%.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to just increase it, decreases that.	O
And yeah, I can even use it for my photo manipulation if I want to.	O
But for this case, since it's a bright light, so I don't need it so I can restore it down.	O
So yeah, there's also so many other things like you can use, like outer glue if I want to make the.	O
But he called out to have a light.	O
Let me just on this so they can see they go.	O
So it's like a light boom.	O
I don't have to use like a manual way of fixing things right?	O
This is glowing.	O
Yeah, and there's also a drop shadow drop shadow usually works for attacks, so it's not fun.	O
In this case.	O
You can also add patterns on the.	O
All this also gradient color.	O
Like for example if you want the color to be slightly yellowish, you can always use color as well, but reduce the opposite E and slowly increase the color.	O
You can see how it is right now so I can actually use this for this.	O
Yeah, so I.	O
I hope I answered your questions to China.	CHITCHAT
Actually waited for this life stream to answer you because it's quite complicated to explain in words.	CHITCHAT
What do you guys think of this manipulation?	CHITCHAT
I want to make this.	O
Sunset beat writer.	O
I'm going to.	O
Vicki brighter by duplicating it so they go.	O
Right, I know I kind of like it this way.	O

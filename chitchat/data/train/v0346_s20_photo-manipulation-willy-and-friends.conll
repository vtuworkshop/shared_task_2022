Oh, that reminds me.	CHITCHAT
That I actually have.	CHITCHAT
Proposed I need to do.	CHITCHAT
Uh, for my Instagram, let me just quickly upload that.	CHITCHAT
If you guys on Instagram you get to see my little's artwork is just a reminder of what's going on right now in the world.	CHITCHAT
We just share the image and I'm going to just add in the caption before we go ahead and edit more of the.	CHITCHAT
The manipulation.	CHITCHAT
Please.	CHITCHAT
Then so if you guys on Instagram we get to see one of my latest work.	CHITCHAT
It's just a reminder of what's going on right now and.	CHITCHAT
But all this suicide cases, all this depression and stuff and fiber blowing.	CHITCHAT
So I just want people to stop this an I thought of doing this at work.	CHITCHAT
So yeah because on Instagram you can just have a look at it.	CHITCHAT
Perfect I kinda like this so I increase the color.	O
And so, before this was a bit darker.	O
So what I did was I multiply the duplicate layer and I just call it a screen.	O
Alright, let me adjust my converse.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Wow, we actually.	CHITCHAT
We're hit overtime as usual.	O
I'm going to fast, hopefully I'm not.	O
Um, let's add in more of the.	O
Tiger shadow is.	O
This is light.	O
Cool and I'm going to add in a bit of shadow onto the Tiger.	O
Not so happy with the shadow.	O
OK, let's change the B.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Shixiong is saying I notice that there's a texture in many arts on your Instagram.	O
How do you do that?	O
HD are on earth.	O
Of texture in many uh oh I think.	O
I only think about so.	O
For example, let's say you're looking at this, right?	O
So what I do is usually at the end of the.	O
Process, usually I do this, I select all I copy merge.	O
I opened up new converse, I paste it and I like to use this.	O
Yes, correct, so this is how I do it.	O
I go to my adjustment and I go for Uhm, Shadow and highlights.	O
When you do this, see what happens.	O
But you need to remember not to overuse this, because it will be too intense and you will just ruin the the manipulation.	O
Right, so always reduce only a little, and since all legs is pointing downwards, Murga.	O
Oh OK, that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Google is it OK to put something like something like ours offering?	O
Oh, that's actually really that's not muga, so I'm not bringing the the stories that I like to tell you.	O
Cycle in.	O
This is so really Savoy that grow in the jungle.	O
So yeah, right now why?	CHITCHAT
The Lake of the defeat of all is like that is because you going to grab the fish out of the bear.	O
If you notice the berries holding a fish, so that's why you trying to grab.	O
OK, so always remember not to overuse this right?	O
Like for example, you can destroy your artwork.	O
There's another way I like to use is called a HD are turning.	O
This is also.	O
Nice, but.	CHITCHAT
Is just too intense, so sometimes I use this.	O
If you want to add green effects, here's what I suggest go up here.	O
Go to filter.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Let's go to noise.	O
And at in the noise, but always use the what he called version.	O
Don't use the uniform it has goes and have a more refined texture.	O
Reduce the amount of noise, not so much.	O
For example.	O
Yeah, to my work life exactly 5 zoom in.	O
You get to see the noise.	O
Right, it adds a bit of effects to the overall.	O
What do you call a manipulation?	O
Because if it's just flat doesn't make sense, right?	O
So yeah, you can even do that.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
We have 15 more minutes.	CHITCHAT
We are on time once again.	CHITCHAT
Cool, let's see what else we can edit.	CHITCHAT
I hope I answered your questions shoe shine.	CHITCHAT
OK, What is this?	CHITCHAT
This is the BB.	O
I know it's really.	O
I always forget the names of the baby cool light so I have to look up here and let's see if I can adjust the color bit mode.	O
I don't think so by adding another color look up my I don't destroy the color.	O

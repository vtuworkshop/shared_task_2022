Why don't we just?	CHITCHAT
Those of you watching online, I think it would be nice to just go back track and see what we have done so far and I love doing this so that you all know how much we have done.	CHITCHAT
Let's start from the top to bottom so we fix the light.	O
The overall light can see before and after color.	O
Look up is something important you can see before color.	O
Look up.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what happens is too yellowish, right?	O
We added the hair.	O
And we we added really we added pens for him.	O
We had accessories, we edit eyebrow phase, light shadow on him an on the yeah even the light we fix and the baby we added more shadows.	O
That was like the original image that you go.	O
Then we remove the editor color for the AL, fix the lighting for that.	O
The Tiger we fixed lighting up, so let me just zoom in there and then they go more edits.	O
As move down.	O
Right, Lightnings and shadow.	O
And then the Cliff.	O
We added the lights and shadow again the yellow tint.	O
This was the original Cliff.	O
And then the bear.	O
We added a fish.	O
And then we added Doctor Shadow.	O
We change the light of the bear so they point the color can be we're just the shadow so that the light is on the left inside.	O
And that's Fair.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Let's how far we have come.	CHITCHAT
Right, so they go.	CHITCHAT
The reverse way you can see I added shadows that fish.	O
Shadow for the fish.	O
Cliff pallet place.	O
And we also added some light.	O
Shadow for the Tiger.	O
Fix the color for the Tiger.	O
We added the owl.	O
Light for the AL.	O
An more.	O
We added, really.	O
And we ended hair and colorful, really.	O
Wow, as long journey.	O
Dennis is saying I did a good few days back on now with the conserve mruga and more.	O
Your oven on technique.	O
Another short story, where did you check out?	O
I will Dennis?	O
Kartik insane.	O
Let me introduce the rule distance.	O
Oh Kartik is confused.	O
Elton it click.	O
Johnny Lima What do you mean by that ultimate trick?	O
Elephant click form asking yes if that's what you're asking.	O
Ultimately.	CHITCHAT
Tomusk by, for example, right now you can see my accessories here.	O
If I press alt and it and I click, I get to mask.	O
So I don't understand.	O
Hopefully I answered your question.	O
Anna cortical saying, How do I know?	O
How can understand better in terms of light and shadow?	O
It comes with practice after take for example.	O
You need to always use what you have around you, right?	O
For example, if you just go outside.	CHITCHAT
The ice.	O
The ice.	O
Alpha, let's click.	O
I still don't understand you giving me one word each time journey.	O
All the eyes.	O
The ice is just.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Are you talking about this ice over here?	O
This actually show in height layers.	O
So what I'm doing is I'm just.	O
Moving down just like this, just.	O
Hot press and moving the ice.	O
Is that why you asking?	O
That's the show height layers.	O
So Kartik, if you want to learn more about lying shadow, I want you to understand how it works.	O
For example, if you go and send outside your house right now, if there's any sunlight you get to see the shadows right if.	O
The light of the sunlight is too harsh.	O
You get to see the silhouette of your shadow is more intense, right?	O
You can see the shape of your shadow is like equal into your body.	O
If it's in a gloomy day where this is sunlight is there by its gloomy you can see your shadow is there.	O
But it's a little blurry, so that's how you see it.	O
And also you can always play with the lights.	O
For example your hand if the light comes from here, you know where is the shadow is and stuff like that alternate click I.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you want to find everything there you go.	O

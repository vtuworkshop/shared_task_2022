So I'm just going to screenshot some of this stuff.	O
Wait the refresh help.	CHITCHAT
I don't repress anything.	O
I don't know what refresh.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I'm going to take a screenshot of this so I can talk to be hands about it.	CHITCHAT
Basically what is happening it says like dropped frames twelve 1200.	O
CPU is being used six 6% at 30 FPS.	O
It seems like everything is fine.	CHITCHAT
I got the green light so I have no idea what that issue is.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Oh God Yeah, but that man.	CHITCHAT
It just makes me so salty.	CHITCHAT
I would just want because now when people come and I'm like, yeah, by the way it goes without re watch the replays it comes in like 2 freaking videos.	CHITCHAT
It's not cute.	CHITCHAT
It's not a good look.	CHITCHAT
OK?	CHITCHAT
Let's let's make this make this shadow happen, let's see.	O
So we got like a little crisp of a line there.	O
And what we're gonna do for that, let's see.	O
Yes we are.	CHITCHAT
We can do.	CHITCHAT
So we've got the bottom one that has the shadow.	O
Alright, let's see David saying there's an input buffer.	O
When you stream of about 30 to 60 seconds.	O
Not sure if he hands let's you change.	CHITCHAT
YouTube does, yeah, I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
I'm really going to have to talk to be hands and see how they do all that.	CHITCHAT
Nila eh?	CHITCHAT
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
Basically what you miss was 10 minutes of really good content that it got shut off and then we had to open this up.	O
So we're basically from starting from Ground Zero, but basically we are recreating this application.	O
We're going to be doing some neo morphism and some animation with this PS five store product.	O
Or product store.	O
Yeah, so I'm super excited about this.	CHITCHAT
Uh, let's just hope there's no more technical difficulties 'cause I will throw my mouse.	O
OK, let's see what we can do.	CHITCHAT
We want to take this.	CHITCHAT
Don't really need a solid color for this one.	O
Turn the path.	CHITCHAT
How do we do this?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to open a older project up to see how I did this.	O
Actually going to try something very experimental real quick, so we're going to turn this shadow on.	O
I'm going to duplicate this circle.	O
I want to mask them.	O
What happened?	CHITCHAT
D we got 2.	CHITCHAT
Control ship them when I'm not working, but should be.	CHITCHAT
Mask wears the mask option.	CHITCHAT
Let's ungroup first.	CHITCHAT
If I do this.	CHITCHAT
They should have that.	CHITCHAT
Let's try this then.	CHITCHAT
I had a student do something super super super, super cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's see shared with me and we're just going to copy it where I want to see what she did.	CHITCHAT
I had no idea how she did this.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Nila, I'm actually not live on YouTube because there's just so much technical difficulty between like be hands in YouTube.	CHITCHAT
Even when I do like I probably could do it on YouTube solo.	CHITCHAT
But I really want to get in on be hands because the things that are in the runway.	CHITCHAT
Are going to be super cool for this platform.	CHITCHAT
However, now let's take this real quick.	CHITCHAT
Going to learn from this.	CHITCHAT
Wanna take that?	CHITCHAT
Please put it back.	CHITCHAT
Close that up.	CHITCHAT
Cool that in and we will figure out how we go.	CHITCHAT
Our friend made this so why I want to do this is she made a really cool.	CHITCHAT
She made it so that this little circle had shadows within it, so I want to see what she did.	O

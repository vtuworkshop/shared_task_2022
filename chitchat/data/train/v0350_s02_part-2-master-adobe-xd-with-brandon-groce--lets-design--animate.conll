Oh OK, so this is what it looks like.	CHITCHAT
So she has ticket look at the.	CHITCHAT
Layers here, so she has this exclusion thing.	O
Let's take a look at this.	CHITCHAT
Let's turn this off.	CHITCHAT
What is this?	CHITCHAT
Right, that's the whole thing.	CHITCHAT
So I pulled this off.	CHITCHAT
And that's what she does.	CHITCHAT
OK, OK, so we could do this, which intersects them.	O
This does the inverse.	O
So what I want to do is I have this when I duplicate this, make that one little bit smaller going to intersect them.	O
Turn the shadow on.	O
Turn these borders off OK.	O
So I kind of want that, but like on the edge.	O
Not entirely sure.	CHITCHAT
I think what I'm just going to do is, I mean duplicate this.	O
Well, I'm glad you were able to make it to be hands nila.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for joining us.	CHITCHAT
And Yeah, the be I mean guys be Hans is an amazing platform.	O
I just gotta figure out 'cause there's certain things that like.	CHITCHAT
For example, I think they have troubles running.	CHITCHAT
Certain resolutions, like for example my video right now if we go back to here it's 4K, but I'm porting 4K into 19, nineteen 20 by 1080.	O
So I think that's what might be the issue there.	CHITCHAT
So I just got to talk to him and figure that out alright, so let's do this.	CHITCHAT
We do our shadows that are white.	O
Turn the blur all the way down to zero 'cause we want.	O
Just like a little.	O
Like a little shadow thing like that, so I'm going to rotate it just a little bit.	O
Not the not that.	CHITCHAT
Go up one.	CHITCHAT
Go to the side a little bit.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
This is a little bit of a blur, So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to.	O
Go into the Shadow and turn the opacity down a little bit.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
I think we can do a little bit more, but I think that works that had that gives us a little bit of that shape, and so we're going to do that with all these other buttons down here.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Sing	CHITCHAT
Let us start with this was to these buttons first were just do the same thing.	O
We're going to go to.	CHITCHAT
Linear gradient.	O
We're going to go light and get this in the middle.	O
Medium black Darkest black I'm going to do is going to angle that here here.	O
And now I want to just make this a component to go control K.	O
And I'm just going to duplicate these.	O
To these other spots that I had.	O
Delete all this and make sure the spacing between everything is a OK Paragon.	O
Alright, so now all we gotta do is we gotta do something to make another point here.	O
Going to pull this out.	O
Make that this color.	O
Halfway through.	O
Make this a little darker.	O
This thing out here just push it over to saturate some saturate.	O
I wanted to look like it has a little bit of a reflective edge kinda, so we got something there, but we also want to let's go to shadow.	O
Now it has somewhat of a like a glow happening, so we're going to try to figure this out.	O

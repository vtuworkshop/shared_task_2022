When I go into the shadow, we're going to hear.	O
And we're going to do two of these.	O
So we have this one button with the shadow.	O
I'm going to duplicate it here.	O
I'm gonna take this shot.	O
I'm going to make it blue this time.	O
Push it up in this way.	O
And I'm going to turn the opacity down so it's not that crazy.	O
Same thing here, and go to the shot on the turn.	O
This down just a little bit.	O
Turn it down just a little bit.	O
And I'm going to do one more.	O
I'm gonna do one more duplicate that.	O
Let's just test something I'm going to take this shadow all the way down to zero.	O
I'm going to bring this in.	O
It's a little bit I'm going to see if I can do a highlight.	O
And you'll see this here.	O
I want to just small highlighting to see if I can get this to negative one negative one go here.	O
Bring this to white.	O
I'm gonna turn the pasta the Just Smidge.	O
Bring that more here.	O
There we go.	O
So we have that nice like crisp edge.	O
So basically what I did to create that and I think what I want to do here in this Phil's going to make this portion the center just a little bit darker.	O
Like that, a tad darker as well.	O
We're going to go back in.	O
We're going to just make it that color that color.	O
Let's see, we try to stretch this out.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Almost almost.	CHITCHAT
Still not happy with that, maybe this just needs to be a little bit closer color.	O
Best closer.	O
That's about there.	O
Try to.	O
Make this a little bit.	O
I think I might be adding too many colours now.	O
Let's see what happens if I pull this out.	O
Trying to do this.	O
Make this a little bit lighter.	O
Make this that blue.	O
Closer, closer closer, but all this is like.	O
Finagle ING guys?	O
Let's close it still looks a little desaturated, some ago here to this blue pump this up just a tad bit.	O
And I think we, I think we can pause there.	O
And I'm just going to group all these rectangles blue, but.	O
Cool, I'm going to ask for more time in the chat.	O
How are we going?	CHITCHAT
As you guys smell anymore technical difficulties, looks like my video.	O
OK man, I thought my video.	CHITCHAT
Paused again, I would be like.	CHITCHAT
Who God?	CHITCHAT
Alright cool, So what we got here?	CHITCHAT
I'm a deep in going to go back here and just groups of this stuff just so I.	O
Menu button cool.	O
Nagauta this darker part here I'm going to scale the blur of this just a little bit.	O
You guys can see here I'm trying to scale this shadow just a little bit.	O
Dark images a little bit scaled up so little, bit more so it spreads.	O
Might be a little too dark.	O
It's popping out too much, so we're going to go back in.	O
Go back, just turn that shadow just a little bit down.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
We don't want to pop into hard, OK?	O
So now we're going to put are going to go to our main component here.	O
Wanted to put a shadow on this.	O
This will put a shadow on everything else.	O
Or at least the other.	O
Components that we have of it.	O

So we're going to angle it just a little bit.	O
We're going to have things the shadow come down at like a 45 directly, 45 degree angle, and we're going to blur this out just a little.	O
Bit cool.	CHITCHAT
We're getting somewhere ladies and gents.	CHITCHAT
We are getting somewhere.	CHITCHAT
So let's try.	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to basically apply what we have here to this shape here, and I think we can easily do that by going to keep this shape, but I'm going to try something.	O
I'm going to copy this shape here.	O
I'm going to UN.	O
boy gotta do we gotta ungroup the component and we're going to actually want to bring this shape.	O
Bring the shape bank bringing back.	O
Oh wait OK bring it back 'cause they need to trace it right quick slide everything up.	O
Bring this nice thing up to the top and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna double click it.	O
And I'm a just scratch AKA stretch, stretch everything, so we're going OK.	O
Let's do this collectively.	O
Let me just select all this.	O
Bring this down.	O
Cool, unselect these, i'ma bring it, these.	O
Now over holding shift.	O
Why do all this?	O
Cool, now I'm just going to hold this.	O
And just pull that up.	O
So Donna.	CHITCHAT
Very nice, cool so we didn't have to recreate anything we had.	O
We got a nice little piece here.	O
This seems it would be like a little funky thing happening here.	O
I don't know with all that, but about there's like a hard corner.	O
OK, what just happened one from busted to even more?	O
OK, I'm going to right click this.	O
Where are the anchor points?	O
Where are the anchor point?	CHITCHAT
Usually when you click like Alt.	O
Let's just do this.	O
Let me just pull this in now.	O
Control Z.	O
Where are the anchor points?	O
With this you should be able to hold alt and then just come up OK.	O
There you go, so I'm holding out now pulling that in.	O
And all I did for to show up as I just I just double click the circles.	O
See now that doesn't have that bump.	O
I wanted.	CHITCHAT
Nice and smooth.	O
Cool alright, so fix that problem now is going to pull this back.	O
Take out that way.	O
Now these guys can see that this has a larger shadow, So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back into our shadows here, turn up the blur a little bit more and bring it more to down on the Y and push it more out on the X here and blurred out just a little bit more.	O
There we go.	O
Duplicate that.	O
Cool, so there we are.	O
Bring these up just a little bit.	O
Thank you guys.	O
Thank you and esco.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for curate.	O
Thank you Miguel.	O
Yeah, so this is a lot to learn, but that's why it's like important to like.	O
This is why I do this.	O
Like all of my colors of front, lay them out and I'm like, OK, well, let's just add this to the Swatch is let's make sure we.	O
Make as much reusable stuff as possible.	O
Let me see what we got now we gotta make this little thing at the bottom.	O
So we're just going to pull actually know what I said that right after I will try to do this.	O
By Ungrouping, we're going to take another component.	O
We're going to pull that out.	O
We're going to keep.	O
Let's do this really quick as well.	O
Let's kind of figure out.	CHITCHAT
So we have 30 pixels on the side here, and we have 47.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all these, just pull them out just a little bit until I have like 30 pixels on each side.	O
So what I'm going to do here?	O
Someone push this in by one so 30 here and we have 30 here.	O
But there's like spacing differences now in between we have 1616 and 15.	O
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna select all these and just hit this readjustment, playing that distributes things.	O
Evenly horizontally, so let's see what it does.	O
1615.	O
Sixteen are what I could technically do is make these things smaller, but this is fine.	O

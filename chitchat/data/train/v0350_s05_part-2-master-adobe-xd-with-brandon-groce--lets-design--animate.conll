So what I'm going to do next?	O
This portion.	O
So what I want to do is these guys can see there's a nice little glowing edge here, so will make that and there's a a dark edge here, so I'm going to duplicate this.	O
I'm going to make a shadow, but I'm going to make it white and you guys will see what I'll do first, so I'm going to bring this up.	O
And to the left here, and I'm turned down the blur all the way to one or two.	O
Zero rather want to do the same thing here, negative one negative one.	O
So you got that nice little round edge you guys see just like that that that crisp edge you feel me.	O
So we're going to do the same thing the other side of kinda already has that if we really wanted to, we could increase the shadow just a little bit.	O
And blurred out just a little bit more, but we're going to put this back on top.	O
And if we if we really wanted to, if it was too because it is really sharp right now, what we could do is duplicate it.	O
Take the this line underneath.	O
And blur this out just a little bit.	O
On the increase.	O
It on the Y axis and on the negative X axis bring this back.	O
Now it's harsh, but it has a little bit of a glow.	O
So what I'm going to do is going to go back to that second rectangle and then go back to his shadow.	O
That turned this down just a tad.	O
And I'm going to go back to this and turn down that hard edges a little bit.	O
So now we have a nice glow, but also that hard edge at the same time.	O
Pretty close.	O
Let me turn that hard edge up.	O
Just just a little bit.	O
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
So now we are.	CHITCHAT
What are we going to do?	O
Still think that the shadow is really, really really strong, so I'm going to go back into here.	O
I'm going to go back into this shadow.	O
I'm going to actually grab.	O
That color that we had in the Swatch.	O
So it's the same color as the background, so it blends in just a little bit.	O
And I'm going to just darkness slowly here.	O
I think it's good.	CHITCHAT
So we have a little bit of edge, but it's not too much.	O
I think that works, and I'm also going to do so.	O
We only have if you guys looking at my color panel or my What is this layer palette through something?	O
The top one I really should have three so this is our highlight.	O
This is our shadow I'm going to duplicate this and make the center one.	O
In the blur out.	O
When they bring it a little bit more to the left.	O
And a little bit more.	O
Up so I have negative two and negative two in the Y&X Axis, so we have that nice blur.	O
'cause before this is what we would have had just like that where you just have the hard edge.	O
We're adding this back in and now it kind of looks glowy, and we're going to blow it out just a little bit, and we're going to turn down the Opacity on that hard edge so it doesn't look too rough.	O
So we're going to hear shadow drop that Opacity just a little bit.	O
There we go back to our shadowing to blurred this.	O
We're going to bring this more so to the left.	O
Up We're also going to change this color too.	O
We wanted to be like that dark grey that we had in our color palette so it blends in a little bit more.	O
Let's see what that looks like.	O
There we go that looks a little bit more blurred.	O
Blended in so now we're going to go back to our shadow.	O
Dark in that up.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Now looks a lot softer.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, how you guys feeling on that one?	CHITCHAT
Darker 2.	O
Actually, I'm just going to use this.	CHITCHAT
I think that's safe, cool, so now it's softer, so that's kind of how you have to layer some certain things to get like that feel.	O

But yeah, I dig it.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now let us.	CHITCHAT
This is actually I'm going to turn this opacity down for whatever reason.	O
It doesn't look like there's a button there.	O
It looks like there's three buttons, and then this odd thing so.	O
And I'm going to turn this opacity down.	O
And now we're almost to the point of getting icons.	O
I just want to make this last thing 'cause it is no more fick and then we'll get into the nitty gritty of how you get PS4 stuff and all that.	O
Good all that goodness.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but how you guys feeling?	CHITCHAT
That said, you guys been awfully quiet.	CHITCHAT
I really appreciate you.	CHITCHAT
You guys are like you like family.	CHITCHAT
Y'all were like Oh my God, Brandy got shut down.	CHITCHAT
We gotta go find the other video so we can see what my man's is doing.	CHITCHAT
Um, so I really do appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Even though we were on a very good track record, the first like 15 minutes and then be hands was like the world does not need to know all this cancel.	CHITCHAT
No, I don't even think it was be hands.	CHITCHAT
I think it was probably my settings 'cause I'm trying a lot of new stuff out here and I probably overloaded.	CHITCHAT
Something, so it's more likely the case.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
So what were we doing?	CHITCHAT
Yes, creating this button.	O
So we're going to just go up in here.	O
Little trace this jump.	O
Power turn off their border.	O
Very cool, now I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Let's see 'cause they actually do something.	CHITCHAT
A lot interesting here.	CHITCHAT
There's like a little indent.	O
I'm really curious how we can make that.	CHITCHAT
I think we're going to do this in a 3A Street.	O
The three step process, so this will be a button.	O
This will be a button and then they'll be underneath button.	O
So let's try.	CHITCHAT
We are going to.	CHITCHAT
Grab this.	O
Wait, hold up blue button rectangle or going to shadow real quick.	O
'cause I think I want to use this.	O
We're going to take this.	O
And again.	CHITCHAT
This is why reusing things are absolutely excellent.	O
When I'm going to do is turn down.	O
The radius of all these however you guys here I did that I just grabbed all the rectangles here.	O
Just changed.	O
The radius, what is the radius on this five?	O
Where does the reading of Sony's five cool good?	O
So let's start off with this.	O
I'm going to take this first rectangle.	O
I'm going to put this Y to 0.	O
'cause as you guys can see, it looks like the highlight is over here at this time I'm going to go in this gradient from the move stuff around.	O
Move this here.	O
Now what I'm going to do?	O
Duplicate this in the move this.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
I don't think we'll see.	CHITCHAT
We'll see where we're testing this works.	O
Actually delete that.	O
We're going to take this and copy paste this here, take.	O
These portions.	O
How?	CHITCHAT
Pull this out.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
No, let's see.	CHITCHAT
I think we can just do it in two pieces.	O
I'm glad already checked.	CHITCHAT

I'm glad I could be be here for you.	CHITCHAT
Are we be here for you and uh?	CHITCHAT

Alright, I'm going to try this.	O
Not sure how this is gonna workout.	O

I really gotta figure out how to do the cross YouTube and be hand live situation because that would be ideal at best.	O
I'm going to try to do this horizontal, so we got that dark thing there.	O
We're going to do this here.	O
Actually, let's see, I'm going to do that dark thing there.	O
Pull that out just a little bit.	O
And so we got that blue.	O
I got that part or wait.	O
Blue select this purple.	O
OK, so now I'm going to pull.	O
Let's see what can we do?	O
So now we kind of have that.	O
But it's not the right color.	O
So what I'm going to do very quickly is going to get this watch.	O
I'm going to grab.	O
This color here this blue and turn that border off real quick so I'm going to go back into here.	O
And then go back to this.	O
Oh, forgot to do this real quick.	O
Add that color.	O
Now when I'm here to go to the gradient, I'm going to select this color.	O
There we go that looks a little bit better.	O
So now what I can do is I can extend this.	O
It's a little bit, so now it looks.	O
What we have is we have one piece down here and we just have this other piece.	O
This other rectangle on top.	O
Let's see actually gonna go to technical issues, not just with you.	O
I saw in other streams and getting the hands team already know.	O
That gives me a lot of like faith.	CHITCHAT
But it really does because I think this platform is really awesome because everybody that uses an Adobe product gets a notification when their favorite streamer, our favorite artist goes live, and I think it's a great way for the community.	O
To grow organically.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm thank you for that information.	CHITCHAT
I'll double check to when I talk to the peeps this week.	CHITCHAT
OK, we have our button basically going to scale this down real quick.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to going to copy that.	O
Pull it over here.	O
Not entirely sure.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
So this I'm going to just make like a quick box just so I can check the distance between.	O
So this is like 17 pixels.	O
Let's see 1818 fine whatever.	O
Cool, so we got that.	CHITCHAT
Now it's time to.	CHITCHAT
Get some writing at home.	O
You know it's really weird guys.	CHITCHAT
I noticed that as I get Super Intense I like start biting the sides of my cheese.	CHITCHAT
Like Like that, I find that really interesting, so I'm going to use a little bit different typography too.	O
I don't like going to light.	O
See what happens then.	O
It really didn't change it all it did not.	O
So we're just going to do, let's see, let's see.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what other.	CHITCHAT
When does sans font?	O
This is new open sounds right now.	O
Maybe let's see this stupid thread.	CHITCHAT
I don't really like open sounds like that.	O
Let's find something else, proxima.	O
No, I'm not feeling praxeum either.	O
What should we?	CHITCHAT
What should we do?	CHITCHAT
Joker, no, yeah right here guys boom.	CHITCHAT
Polio.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, maybe we'll just do Helvetica or something.	O
Not only not that's one thing that I wish XD had is to be able to see what the font is, what it looks like at least.	O
Alright, we'll go with railway.	O

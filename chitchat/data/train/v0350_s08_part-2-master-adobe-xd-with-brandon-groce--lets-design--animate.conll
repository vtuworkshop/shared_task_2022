Oh, it only has those two.	O
Font family.	O
I will do this.	CHITCHAT
Please have light.	O
It does not have light, OK?	O
OK, will do popping that seems.	O
Seems reasonable.	O
See if it has a light version is indeed it do.	O
And we might change this.	O
But at least wanted to get something.	O
This is 12 away.	O
1914 Trying to get this in the centre we got 1716.	O
Alright, That's good enough.	O
Now I am going to open up my plugins.	O
Let me go home.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So we got that one.	O
I think there's a better one.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'll just go with this look like this.	O
We're also going to turn down some of the.	O
Stroke to try to get this in the center so there's 10 on that side.	O
And eleven against one pixel off totally fine.	O
I'm gonna bring this one size down.	O
Looks a little weird.	CHITCHAT
Not entirely sure if I dig it.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if I can.	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to leave that there for right now I'm going to move this over just a tad bit, 'cause for some reason it's bothering me.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why.	O
OK, so we have our home want to increase the size of this just in time.	O
15 12 1314 that's good enough right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to my layers panel going to take this rectangle with this blue button, go to the bottom most button and I'm going to go ahead.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Turn shadow on.	O
I'm going to get this dark shadow that we have in our color palette that were used across the board and our design so far.	O
My bring it for some reason.	O
I like everything at that 45 degree angle.	O
I'm going to do it 4 by 4 and then we're just gonna Blurt out perfect there we go.	O
That's that's really what the the what's it called.	CHITCHAT
But should have been Taco.	O
That's what it should be called Taco truck font.	O
OK, cool, let's see.	CHITCHAT
So now we're going to go ahead and we're going to go back to our icons or plugins rather.	O
To profile, hold on.	O
OK or person?	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we got that.	CHITCHAT
So we have one person.	O
I'm going to see if we can get another one here.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Settings.	CHITCHAT
Cool, got a nice little cog here.	O
Get another one.	O
I'm going to solid one.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
And now I'm going to get a bookmark.	O
Cool simply.	CHITCHAT
I got an extreme urge to sing like Dora the Explorer right there.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea why.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we have our main 3 icons 123.	O
We're going to pull that onto our art board and we just gon make them light.	O

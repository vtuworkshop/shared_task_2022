Alright you feel me?	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to just bring it this down and you know what?	O
Yes, we are there.	CHITCHAT
We are happening.	CHITCHAT
Fire delicious.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Cool, so we got that.	O
Who is the sender?	O
These puppies out and we're just going to bring opacity down by like 40% by just hitting #4.	O
Right, so now let's check.	O
So we have 17 pixels from the side to the button and we kind of want to check this out.	O
This meeting sick like Loki, gives me an art survives.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if you guys are like getting that, but it's like no.	CHITCHAT
I'm saying I'm like almost there, it's happening.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
OK, so I think.	CHITCHAT
Select all these.	O
Pull these out this way.	O
18 on the move.	O
All these out just by one so that you have 17.	O
Also, as always, I'm just going to cross compare.	O
I'm going to take these and just pull them over.	O
I held out by the way so I can duplicate them.	O
I want to see the size.	O
Of these things in the space thing, so I got this at this very cool.	O
Copying is not wrong.	O
Ladies and gentlemen, it is just trying to find the most correct answer and using that information for yourself.	O
This is true, all right?	O
So we got 17 here.	O
Alright just seems about right.	O
This does seem a bit close.	O
Let me see this check this.	O
Holding all coming in here trying to check with the button going to scale this down just a little bit.	O
Alright, so now I'm going to copy all this.	O
Now that I have the correct or what it seems to be the correct size delete that bring the thin Hallelujah you feel me, OK?	O
Nothing is well, right?	CHITCHAT
This seems like were there were happening, it's happening guys.	CHITCHAT
Still not entirely sure how I feel about this icon, but.	O
Scanner.	O
Bergenfield with that OK.	O
So we got some more icons in there.	O
Going to get a menu icon really quick.	O
One of those strange odd ones, so I'm just going to click in here.	O
Grab this.	O
Pull that in.	O
And before I do that, I'm actually just going to like I said, copying is the best way to figure out how to make something, so we're going to see scale this down.	O
See the actual sizing.	O
Pull this in.	O
Alright cool.	CHITCHAT
Select that, pull that in.	O
Black, you'll feel it.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
OK, things getting awkward on the Brandon Channel.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea where.	CHITCHAT
My menu just went.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there it is.	CHITCHAT
Going to turn the sizing of the border down just a little bit.	O
Send it this puppy.	CHITCHAT
Make a light.	O
Oh wait, it was supposed to be like, wait, hold on no, it's like here we go home.	O
Great out to us a little bit so we know like it's kind of their cool.	O
Feeling it.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Now we have our weird icons.	O
I'm gonna go in here really quick 'cause I see that this that this that oh this shadow is pretty thick.	O
Some of the ticket make it a little thick.	O
I'm going to blur it out just a little bit less.	O
Move it across the X axis a little more.	O
Turn it down.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Another thing I notice is that there's a little bit of shine here too.	O
To give it that nice crisp edge.	O
So I think we're going to have to do the same thing that we did with these other other sections I'm going.	O
I just duplicated, i'mma turn off the shadow here, or actually we want it on one at white.	O
We're going to turn down this blur all the way down to 0.	O
We're going to do.	CHITCHAT
Everything in the negative.	O

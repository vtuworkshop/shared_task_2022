You can't breathe when you do this.	CHITCHAT
You gotta be like.	CHITCHAT
And get the lines let you know.	O
Connected and all that alright, so I'm going to select this, make selection to the man and not that one the other one.	O
OK, there we go.	CHITCHAT
We're going to do that to this side as well foam foam.	O
Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
Pull that out.	O
Tablet blau boom like that, select.	O
This is what I should have done from the beginning.	O
I was trying to be cute and I'll be like look at this new feature which works excellent in certain ones, but obviously this was very close to the background.	O
The black one came out very nice.	O
So in the save that take out this background, save cool.	O
Nicely done ladies and gents.	CHITCHAT
Hum OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
So we have this.	CHITCHAT
Just chilling now.	CHITCHAT
We we is going to do what we're probably finna do, ladies and gentlemen.	CHITCHAT
Bring this.	O
Down just a tad.	O
It's like there and bring this up in the passage is a little bit.	O
Acute is tomorrow makes me uncomfortable yo, I feel you I.	CHITCHAT
I think there's like a level of uncomfortable iti that we have to have in our lives.	CHITCHAT
Though I don't know, I've been really there's like this one person who's been like eating like Slime Gems and for whatever reasons it has like salt or whatever like crunchy stuff in it and I'm like it makes me feel a certain way however.	CHITCHAT
I love to watch people paint and do a.	CHITCHAT
Some are just like slow, methodical things I really enjoy.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
OK, So what we're going to do really quick is going to add a shadow to this as well.	O
We're going to blur the South lot.	O
Turn this up just a little bit.	O
And I'm going to add it to be the color that we use, like Swatch is.	O
That's another thing, like when you're trying to pick colors and what not.	O
It's a very nice too.	O
Like pick all around the same colors like.	O
Instead of having the shadows of these elements be straight black, there a variation of this background black, so I would go in here pick that's watch and then just make it a tad darker rather than just going straight to black.	O
So it's all in like a complementary spectrum.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So looks like we are we're doing pretty good.	CHITCHAT
It's really interesting to me is that there's this like outer shadow that's like casting shadow inside.	O
The application, which is really odd.	O
We might try to do that.	O
I think that would be super super super super interesting.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm going to try to do?	O
Do this duplicate bringing this in.	O
Bring this in by a little bit, but wait, hold it.	O
Bring this in by a little bit like.	O
15 bring this in by like 15.	O
Cool and.	CHITCHAT
Try this.	CHITCHAT
Shadow	O
OK so we got.	CHITCHAT
Dark in this up and what I'm doing is I'm trying to get the shadow inside of this.	O
And you guys will see it on about it.	O
Do in a second.	O
So boom, boom going to hit this color.	O
Just a little bit, and now what I'm going to do now that we have like that outer shadow.	O
What I'm going to do is I'm going to pull this white edge outside of our art board.	O
So we don't see anything turn the border off too so we don't see anything but that internal shadow casted on everything.	O
And guys to think that this this is the thing my student taught me how to do this like never.	O
I'm a martial artist, so I call it.	CHITCHAT
I keep the white belt mentality, no matter how good you get, no matter how much notoriety or an experience you have.	CHITCHAT

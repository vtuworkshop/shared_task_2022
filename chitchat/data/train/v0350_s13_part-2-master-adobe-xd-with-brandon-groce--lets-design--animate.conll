Like always be sure to listen to other perspectives, because like I said before, we have strengths and weaknesses in my yard.	CHITCHAT
You can already tell like what my strengths and weaknesses.	CHITCHAT
I just know to practice a lot in order to make myself good at something that's the only thing that has ever really.	CHITCHAT
Help me Excel, whereas other people like we had in here earlier we had Leona Uhm who I look up to because she's just like incredibly smart is able to like, deconstruct very complex information and even talk about complex information.	O
I always have to like do the reverse side to have a very hard time understanding complex.	CHITCHAT
Things so when I tried to learn I still learn about it, but what I try to do then is when I learn it.	CHITCHAT
I really try to bring it back down to simpler terms.	CHITCHAT
So not only I can explain it to somebody else, but so the person I'm explaining it to can pick it up easier because they not they don't have to go and learn the complicated thing to understand it.	CHITCHAT
They literally can take the fundamentals in elements that I broke down for them in understanding that way so.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I don't know why I was talking about listening.	CHITCHAT
Oh, because my student taught me how to do this.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I don't know everything under the sun.	CHITCHAT
I just know I do two things.	CHITCHAT
Well, I know how to find information, study it, and applied.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let us get this.	O
Other controller into play.	O
And bring it in here.	O
Let's see what is the opacity to this 3535 perfect.	O
Excellent.	CHITCHAT
Alright, what else?	CHITCHAT
We got my music stop playing.	CHITCHAT
The whole thing over again.	CHITCHAT
So now what I want to do is, I still think we need like a little bit more glow.	O
Um, from this button we still need like a gradient in the background.	O
So what I'm doing here I'm going to go to for more solid color.	O
We're going to set up our gradient here, so we're going to do is we're going to apply everything just like we did in these buttons.	O
We're going to go back to our Swatch is.	O
We're going to light.	O
Middle.	O
Dark ale.	O
OK, cool, so now we have a little bit of a gradient happening.	O
Uhm, I also want to.	CHITCHAT
I want to make sure that this shadow is casting.	O
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
Boom, so I'm going to go in again.	O
I'm going to try to use one of these.	O
Darker colors that we've already used.	O
Turn down opacity a little bit.	O
It's getting a little too intense in this blue here.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Guys didn't even know I could do this.	CHITCHAT
I was so scared to do this.	CHITCHAT
Uh, let's call it.	CHITCHAT
I was so scared to do this this live.	CHITCHAT
I was like man we gotta do alive of something I've never even done before.	CHITCHAT
We literally just about to open up the pod or another podcast but the the What is this a live stream and figure it out from there.	CHITCHAT
'cause I was like man, they're going to roast me if I open up like alive tutorial.	CHITCHAT
Teach them how to do, but I don't know, um, but you know, is learning in progress for me too.	CHITCHAT
I don't always had to teach.	CHITCHAT
We learn together alright, so let's see, let's just see.	CHITCHAT
I do want little bit more dark here so I'm just add another anchor point here and made a little bit darker in this section here.	O
I'm going to do the same thing in this.	O
Make this a little bit darker.	O
Move this up.	O
Just hope so I don't need four or five of them here, perfect.	O
Okie Dokes Um?	CHITCHAT
What I'm actually going to do delete that I'm going to make?	O
123 I cannot select this last very cool control K make this whole thing a component.	O
Oh There's one more thing.	O
Well, in one more thing, Jackie.	CHITCHAT

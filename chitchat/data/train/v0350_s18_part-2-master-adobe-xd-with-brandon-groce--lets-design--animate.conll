So I would select all this stuff.	O
Fat fat	CHITCHAT
That is that.	CHITCHAT
This I can do stacks here, which are pretty.	O
Pretty interesting, so it's tax do.	CHITCHAT
Wanna move this out-of-the-way really quick?	O
Take this blue button.	O
Along with his icon.	O
With that So what I can do here so I can take this entire group of icons?	O
My Conroe.	CHITCHAT
Bring this into icon rope.	O
And I can shift.	O
Things after only two stacks horizontally.	O
Let's see if this card there we go.	O
Very simply, reorganize and shift things around without having to move too much.	O
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
Someone just shift everything back.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm just keep it here perfectly, still stacked.	O
Now I want to see that secondary part.	O
Where he does the scrolling, let's see.	O
Come on dance key.	CHITCHAT
Who's got the fruit?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Oh on scroll not actually taping.	O
OK, that's where I was messing up guys.	CHITCHAT
I knew that this was the new feature.	O
So this is how it works, so I have these two components here.	O
I've got 1, two and so when I play this or excuse me I'm going to set this to horizontal scrolling.	O
Going to pull this out here to the end of that card so when I play this it actually see this should be working and it's not.	O
Kim possible.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back.	CHITCHAT
Let's figure out why.	CHITCHAT
Turn down there.	O
OK, so he's keeping it within the bounds.	CHITCHAT
Interesting, OK?	CHITCHAT
Let's do this then.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Play.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
He said no work.	CHITCHAT
OK, well that's just me.	CHITCHAT
Then I'll figure out that on my own time and come back and let you guys know how that works, but we're not going to worry about that.	CHITCHAT
What we're going to do.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to ungroup.	O
Fixed position when scrolling.	O
I'm still kind of upset that he literally just showed that an I can't do it.	CHITCHAT
Like Why?	CHITCHAT
Scroll group.	O
I wonder if it's like this?	O
OK, that is.	CHITCHAT
Horizontal.	O
Or vertical rather OK, this is sideways, so let's see.	O
Yeah, I don't know why it's not working.	O
Yeah, absolutely no idea.	CHITCHAT
OK, we're not gonna worry about that.	CHITCHAT
We're going to undo that, and we're going to go back to our simple scrolling.	O
So we have this grouped.	O
An I'm going to close that duplicate this.	O

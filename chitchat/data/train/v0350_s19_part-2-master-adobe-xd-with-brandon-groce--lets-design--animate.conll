I'm going to do is.	CHITCHAT
Bring this interview.	O
Take this turn, opacity all the way up.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
If we really wanted to, I'm going to go back even more, so I'm going to close this again.	O
I want to duplicate this component one more time.	O
I'm going to actually make it lighter one.	O
This is going to drag this over.	O
Make sure it's the same.	O
OK, cool now and the reason why I wanted to do that ladies and gents is because when I do this I still want there to be another card so it doesn't look empty.	O
Now want to take this all the way up to 100%.	O
And take this, bring it down to that 35%.	O
Cool, I only do the same thing.	O
Back over here with this type in 35.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now what I can go ahead and do is I'm going to go to prototype.	O
I'm going to say.	CHITCHAT
Over here we're going to do a drag auto anime, easing reduce snap.	O
Same thing we're going to.	O
Pull this back over here.	O
Snap perfect so this is what we should be looking like right now.	O
The ability to pull all this cool simple stuff and you got the nice easy fading.	O
One thing we have to do is we want to fade this out as it's pulled as well.	O
Cool, so we're going to click in here going here.	O
Go back to design type in 35.	O
Perfect hit the save button.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
See.	CHITCHAT
Click on it.	O
All right, and we will do this one small portion because this next piece is going to take a little bit longer, so.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to pool.	O
See what happens.	O
So this.	CHITCHAT
Going a little bit further, that Opacity goes all the way down.	O
All the way down I'm going to bring.	O
This component up here.	O
We're just going to 0.	O
All of those bits out.	O
We're going to drag this.	O
Full across bring it up.	O
Around here to make.	CHITCHAT
Actually going to make a.	O
Don't want to fill to be in here, that's gonna mess and stuff up when there's stuff behind it as you guys can see here, there's still dark missing.	O
There would have picked it out.	O
So I'm gonna click into this controller going to.	O
Is to bring scale.	O
Controller up Make a 5050 right about there.	O
Center that.	O
We're going to go and find.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
You want this featured stuff here?	O
So, OK cool.	CHITCHAT
Featured and then we have.	O
Or not.	CHITCHAT
Going to move some stuff to the side just so I can select these two.	O
And pull them off to the side.	O
Here zero opacity.	O
Pull this back to the center.	O
Have this shoot off to the side here.	O
And let's see what changes here.	O
So this actually.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back.	O
Dinner menu here.	O

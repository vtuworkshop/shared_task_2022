Will it take?	CHITCHAT
A little icons in here.	O
1.	O
To start lining them up here.	O
Reusing assets 1111.	O
11 perfect I'm saying scale this.	O
And now what I'm going to do is.	O
Change these icons.	O
And I feel like I already in going to have.	O
Some prototype issues because I have not.	O
It's always better to check what you're doing as you go.	O
We have not done any of that, so I already know things going to morph into other things and it's going to be funky.	O
What national and grab this?	O
Trying to center it in there also try to put it in the group and to be honest I'm just going to.	O
1111 and you guys are curious how I did that.	O
I basically just reached a created a repeat grid, repeated it out, and then ungrouped it.	O
Alright, now let's take it.	O
Black controller.	O
Raisin here 'cause that is our select one.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
But OK, who OK?	CHITCHAT
Now let us.	CHITCHAT
Do this.	O
Make sure that this is in our group.	O
OK, that's in a group that's in a group, then simply perfect.	O
I'm going to group this entire thing when I'm come over to our previous art board.	O
Paste it, hold up.	O
Paste it in.	O
Push it down zero pasetti OK.	O
Now what I'm going to do is when I click on next component, I want us to prototype.	O
Jump over now.	O
This might get a little messy, but this is part of the process.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, see that's where the funkiness is.	O
OK, So what basically is happening is I have a scroll mechanic happening as well as a click mechanic trying to happen at the same time, so I'm going to do here is.	O
We spread these out real quick.	O
Undo that click.	O
Here.	O
Tap snap.	O
OK, let's see what happens with this.	O
So we have our scroll when we click on this.	O
Actually that wasn't bad.	O
I was not bad at all.	CHITCHAT
I was I was way better than I was expecting.	CHITCHAT
Um, alright, so we have our back button.	O
We're going to make sure that it goes back.	O
We have our snap.	O
Perfect, OK, so this is what we have.	O
We are scrolling happening.	O
Click in this pops into place.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
I think we can do a little bit better in terms of the animation.	O
It does.	O
I mean, it does do pretty well.	O
I would like however.	O
Like that's that's a nice transition.	O
I think we can do better with these icons were they literally just leave that bar if we really wanted to, we could mask this entire area to keep these icons and so for example that I could do is I could pick a rectangle here.	O
Select these icons.	O

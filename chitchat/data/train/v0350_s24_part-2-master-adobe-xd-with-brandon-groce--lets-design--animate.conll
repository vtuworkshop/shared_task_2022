Control shift M.	O
Click inside where to go.	O
Let me click here we go.	O
Now I can fix the mask so.	O
It's showing them.	O
And I'm going to just copy this and make sure that I have it across all artboards, because again, in Adobe XD if things.	O
Are not the same name and stuff.	O
Things get all jacked up, so I'm going to come in here, delete these icons, paste these icons here.	O
And what I'm going to do is I'm going to select all these and pull them down.	O
So you'll actually will disappear within the mask.	O
And not fall off the bar.	O
Let's take a look at this kind of swipe click.	O
See, there was a little fast.	O
Couldn't really tell.	CHITCHAT
No, it worked.	O
It worked very nice, awesome and we can be a little, you know, little sneaky and do stuff like.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Where is our?	O
Mask here we really wanted to.	O
We could make it so that two go down, one goes up.	O
So we can do a whole bunch of stuff and we'll just do one more screen will do one more screen.	O
'cause it will be super simple and remove these.	O
What I'm going to do now is I'm going to take this lighter controller.	O
Bring it in here.	O
I'm gonna scale it to the same size as this.	O
Whoops Is darker controller.	O
To an opacity down.	O
XML and do that.	O
I'm a copy it then.	O
I'm going to turn opacity down.	O
Turn it back up just to make sure.	O
100% like lined up.	O
OK cool.	CHITCHAT
Come over here.	O
Make sure its name the same so image 9 come back over here image not good.	O
I'm going to take image N 10, which is the controller behind.	O
I'm going to turn down the Opacity and I am going to transition.	O
This group.	O
My duplicate it and bring this.	O
Down here.	O
Copy and bring it over here.	O
Now I'm going to do.	CHITCHAT
Here is I'm going to change.	O
The controller.	O
Delete that.	O
Bring this here.	O
Group these two together.	O
Excellent.	CHITCHAT
Turn this 20.	O
I'm going to turn the opacity down just a little bit so I can align this stuff up.	O
Good.	CHITCHAT
Turn it up, copy it, turning to pass it all the way down.	O
Go to the new artboard.	O
Delete that, push this on an I kind of had to do the same for the dark controllers going to copy this.	O
Come over here.	O
Push this up, whoops something.	O
Oh, I know what I did.	O
Because of this.	O
All the way up.	O
To know passing downturn lines and stuff up.	O
It's close enough.	O
I'm going to go in.	O
Let's take that light controller out.	O
And I'm going to.	O
Turn the opacity up on on this.	O
Turn the opacity down on that lighter controller.	O

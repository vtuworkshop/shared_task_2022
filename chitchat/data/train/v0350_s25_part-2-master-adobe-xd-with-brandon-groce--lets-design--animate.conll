Or that first controller now going to come in here and grab this.	O
Control C.	O
Control V.	O
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
We're going to click here prototype where they go.	O
Over here, we click here.	O
Actually I need to group this.	O
Make sure it's OK.	O
1 two group prototype.	O
We click there on this button.	O
Go back over here right now.	O
This is going to be very funky.	CHITCHAT
Just bear with.	CHITCHAT
This is a test this.	O
OK, just a simple fade.	O
And we can do a little bit more like we just what just wanted to check that out.	O
So here for example.	O
I have my hands are sweating hard guys.	CHITCHAT
Ralph is asking brandies, JPEG or PNG to export images.	O
It really depends PNG's, if I am if I have a transparent background and I use Jpegs if it just has the background.	O
So let's see let's see let's see.	CHITCHAT
Hope that answers your question draft and I appreciate you hold it in there.	O
I don't know when.	CHITCHAT
When you ask that question, So what I'm going to do now, now that I know that this kind of works, so image 9, which is our.	O
Light controller.	O
Come here to bring this down by two.	O
So basically what I did is I took the invisible controllers.	O
I'm not sure if you guys could see it, so now we should have like a little shift.	O
There we go.	O
And how I did this was the invisible light controller image 9.	O
I pushed it down.	O
Probably put it down even more.	O
Come back over here, go back to image 10.	O
Push this down two times the same thing I went over to this art board and turned it all the way down and hit shift and down arrow key about four times.	O
Now we just do one last thing.	O
Wanna shift this back over here?	O
Perfect and this is what we got guys we have in about What is this?	O
3 hours who made some pretty good time, especially with the technical difficulties that we had.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So this is what I surprise myself.	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at what we did together today, guys.	CHITCHAT
We have nice scrolling.	O
Click in.	O
I kind of want to slow that down just a little bit.	O
Let's see what we can do on that.	O
So to turn slow down the scrolling just a little bit.	O
Will come over here and do .6 seconds simply that gets us.	O
There we go, that was last smooth lot smoother.	O
I'm sure it could be a little bit faster.	O
And now we could just click here.	O
I think I'm going to increase the time between those as well.	O
Popcorn 2.4 .4 one last time.	O
Very nice.	CHITCHAT
Nice little bounce in there.	O
I cool guys, ladies and gentlemen.	CHITCHAT
Thank you guys so much for joining me your boy Brandon Groves here to basically create a really awesome PlayStation 5 mark up so I really do appreciate you guys coming out and really just hanging in there with all the technical difficulties.	O
Again.	CHITCHAT
Much better than the previous live streams.	CHITCHAT
But we still have some way to ways to go.	O
I'll be talking to the hands team to figure out why.	O
No, I keep overloading the system.	O
If it's me or if it's platform, so we'll get that figured out.	CHITCHAT
So with that said, guys, I hope you guys have had an amazing time on the stream.	CHITCHAT
I'll give a couple minutes here before we hop up here.	CHITCHAT

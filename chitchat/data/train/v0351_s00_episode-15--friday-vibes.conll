Welcome, welcome to the stream my hairs.	CHITCHAT
Does not doing it today, I guess.	CHITCHAT
Does not like me today.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, that's what happens when you wear hats all your life.	CHITCHAT
I guess I'm just going to pull my knee up here there we go perfect.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome to this dream.	CHITCHAT
OK so?	CHITCHAT
Today I kind of wanted to start off a new, um komposit But I'm not sure how far will get with it, but maybe I don't know.	O
We'll start something new.	CHITCHAT
So let's get the idea first.	O
So let's go to our mainstage here.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful quote, alright.	CHITCHAT
Let's open up a good old photo shop here.	O
Actually, not.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to just open up the discord for a second, 'cause I believe that there is a contest on here that we can.	O
Do.	O
Uhm yeah, OK, so let's go to community challenge 16.	O
We haven't done this one yet.	O
It looks a little hard.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I don't really get it.	CHITCHAT
Too much.	CHITCHAT
Because like.	CHITCHAT
Collages are pretty personal anyways, so it does that doesn't really help.	O
But yeah, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't really get it.	CHITCHAT
I believe what I'm supposed to do I think is I'm supposed to create an image with like 5 stories in it.	O
But I don't know all right, so let's let's go on Adobe stock here.	O
Actually, let's look up some inspiration first, let's see if there's.	CHITCHAT
Go on Behance.	O
See if there's any inspiration up here.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's search photo manipulation.	O
Oh, I know.	CHITCHAT
I know this artist, she's really good.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Not really seeing anything that I really.	CHITCHAT
Really want to do.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this one's really cool.	CHITCHAT
But I've kind of.	CHITCHAT
I think I've seen this concept like a few times already.	O
But I mean like it is kind of cool though like.	CHITCHAT
I mean, we could.	CHITCHAT
We could try it.	CHITCHAT
We basically just need like a skin to see like most of this I think was drawn like this skin was, I think, drawn.	O
I like it, though.	CHITCHAT
That's a cool one.	CHITCHAT
That's definitely some inspiration.	O
I'm going to give that wanna like.	CHITCHAT
Uh, let's see what is possible here.	CHITCHAT
We've tried something like this before, I'm pretty sure.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh This is kind of a cool technique like making everything like Forestry and stuff, but I'm pretty sure that this is just like.	O
A photo shop filter.	O
And I think that I actually have this.	CHITCHAT
So let's just go to themeforest.net for a second.	O
Oh, that's cool you can do before and after slides on your.	O
That's interesting, I didn't really know about this feature on on a project before.	O
That's a game changer right there.	O
I like how they removed like most of the cars here, they just kind of like place like other cars on top.	O
I'm pretty sure these are pixel squid elements.	O
Um, broken.	O
All I know a good one, I know what we're going to do.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we are going to let's go to let's go here and we need an aerial.	O

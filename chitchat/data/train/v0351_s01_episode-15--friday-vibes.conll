We need aerial water shot here.	O
I know what I'm going to do.	CHITCHAT
OK so this one works pretty good actually.	O
We need something zoomed out a little bit more.	O
This one might work pretty good, but how long is that 10,000 pixels?	O
That is huge.	CHITCHAT
That is huge.	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness, I make what's up?	CHITCHAT
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
My friend?	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the stream welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome today.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be making a an image.	O
I just need to find.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is it right here, perfect this is it.	O
Let's licenses.	O
Alright, so I just needed some water here.	CHITCHAT
Let's open up photo shop.	O
Where is my library's hidden?	O
If my libraries can next.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm gonna rotate this 'cause I always like to do the.	O
Eat in half by 11.	O
Cool, that's a good template to start off with for sure for sure.	O
So we're going to grab that there.	O
OK now let's see if we can find some like.	O
Let's see if we can find a heart.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I might just be able to.	CHITCHAT
That's my Gmail don't want to go there.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Broken heart.	O
You just need like.	CHITCHAT
I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to use this element, so we just need kind of.	O
Like a template.	O
To work with uhm?	CHITCHAT
There's nothing that really looks like nice, though I like it's all just kind of.	CHITCHAT
I mean that now.	CHITCHAT
Like this, this would be nice.	CHITCHAT
That's a nice one.	O
Can you please explain the project So what I'm going to try?	CHITCHAT
And yeah I can easily explain it.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm going to attempt to do is I am going to take a like a heart object like this.	O
And in the water here, we're going to kind of like recreate that heart using islands, so it's going to look like Mother Nature's like her hearts breaking right?	O
It's going to be kind of a really interesting concept.	O
I kind of like this one.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's just use this as a template.	O
I think that that will work.	O
1st just going to remove black.	O
OK, now let's get rid of this.	O
Excuse me, I just kind of want to.	CHITCHAT
Grab both elements like, separate each, separate each element English please.	O
Alright and then we're just going to go through here, just easy.	O
Just you know, nothing doesn't have to be too too specific or anything that was a misclick.	O
You obviously don't want to like touch the red though.	O
This is a lot harder than I thought it would be to click through here, but my accuracy is just like it would be easier if I was actually like zoomed but.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Already kind of got a disadvantage who is one of my eyes doesn't work, so we might as well just make everything tough.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so there we go now.	O
We got 1/2 of our broken heart.	O
And then the other half.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
All right now that we have our broken hearts, we need an island.	O
So let's like we're not.	CHITCHAT

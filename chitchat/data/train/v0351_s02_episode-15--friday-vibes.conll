We're not using this, uh, this in our overall element.	O
So that's why I can copy it from Google right now, because we're completely removing it in the long run.	O
But yeah, so let's grab some.	CHITCHAT
Let's grab some rubble.	O
Is there some sand?	O
Actually, can I just heard island?	O
Maybe they have an island already.	CHITCHAT
OK, well they have the palm trees, so that's good.	O
We need those.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Will call out on Broken Island Alright.	O
Will throw that on there.	O
We probably need some you know.	CHITCHAT
Let's Add all these three elements because you know we might as well not limit ourselves with pixel squid.	O
Alright, perfect and watch this.	O
That actually looks pretty decent.	O
OK, so let's let's add that to our broken island 2.	O
And let's see if they have land.	O
Wow, when you search land you just get like animals all over the place.	O
This is all animals alright, so let's search like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Landscape.	O
OK, that works.	O
I guess we'll throw some of that in there too.	O
I just need like just some elements that are.	O
Like this kind of where it has like the rough edges, but it's like sand.	O
This doesn't look that bad.	O
It's not the worst.	CHITCHAT
But it would be nice if there was just like sand.	O
Is there just sand here?	O
This is OK.	CHITCHAT
Search Search aerial island.	O
OK, so this is going to be my reference.	O
Not gonna license that because I'm just.	O
Referencing it.	O
Just so that I know what I'm not, that's why I know what I want.	CHITCHAT
Oh, terrain, yeah terrain, that's a good.	O
That's a good one.	O
That is a good word.	CHITCHAT
Definitely a good word, Joe.	CHITCHAT
Yes, look at your own point.	O
You're exactly where we're supposed to be perfect.	O
Let's add this beautiful.	O
It's like you think that if you search landscape you would have still gotten that.	O
But Alright, Adobe OK, Alright Pixel squid, sorry that's not that's an Adobe.	O
That's pixel squid.	O
But then again, I'm just the type to complain, right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, they these elements should all work for now I am going to add this one here too.	O
And then let's get some sand.	O
Excuse me if we have sand.	CHITCHAT
Sandy won't we already got that one?	CHITCHAT
Alright, that should work.	O
I think for now.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, let's just.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to hang Castle in there 'cause I just have another idea for another image.	O
So yeah, 01 second.	CHITCHAT
My cat actually just.	CHITCHAT
Came down here.	CHITCHAT
This cat's not supposed to really be down here because she's got like.	CHITCHAT
A kidney problem, so I kinda like have to make it so that she can't come down here to eat my other cat food.	CHITCHAT
But she I have no idea how she even just got down here.	CHITCHAT
Honestly.	CHITCHAT
She must've just like opened up a door or something.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to be right back for a second.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to put this funky little cat upstairs.	CHITCHAT
Wow, that was weird.	CHITCHAT
I guess you like I guess you like fully opened up like the door or something and like just decided hey you know I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go downstairs today, alright, so let's let's bring our elements now let's see what we got here.	O

Alright, so we have our hearts and we have everything perfect and we have our island reference.	O
Alright, I'm going to bring in some pixel squid stuff here.	O
I think I'm going to start with the sand around the edges 1st and then bring the landscape in after.	O
Look at the wrong file.	CHITCHAT
All right there we go perfect, so let's bring in that's and.	O
Let's see if we can actually make it like an aerial view of.	O
This should work perfect.	O
We just really need like just the sand really.	O
We don't need anything like 2 two fancy.	O
Alright, so I'm going to just try clip masking this into here for now and see what it.	O
OK, so we're going to have to like wave it out around here.	O
And then curl that OK.	O
OK, so now I'm going to go in here.	O
And just turn on my.	O
Mask Oh, Red Riddle.	O
And it seems that.	CHITCHAT
That's not going to help me.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to just change these quickly.	O
So let's just go.	CHITCHAT
I'm not, I'm not too worried about like the colours or anything like that.	O
I just don't want it read right now 'cause I just don't want to work with it with the red color is just not.	O
It's so bright, right?	O
Like just not not a fun color.	O
Alright, so let's select this.	O
What?	CHITCHAT
OK, there we go.	CHITCHAT
OK now I'm going to go in with the brush.	O
Let's go down my my secret brush back.	O
All right, this should work.	O
OK, perfect.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm just going to kind of like roughly just go like around it.	O
Don't worry like this does not have to be perfect whatsoever.	O
Well, not that area.	O
I'm just making it so that it looks more like kind of kind of rocky.	O
It's actually good that I'm not doing it like perfect.	O
'cause this looks more like it'll look more like saying that way.	CHITCHAT
His landscapes aren't aren't always perfect.	O
You know landscapes are just not nothing.	O
They just you can't have a perfect cut out like this.	O
Ooh, that's late.	CHITCHAT
That's that's a pretty nice rough edge there.	O
Maybe if I just keep dipping in and out there we go?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So there's our selection.	O
I'm just going to now just kind of.	CHITCHAT
Plot that in there and get rid of this.	O
Beautiful.	O
Beautiful, but terrible at same time, right?	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
See like this, this heart right here on this side is more like landscape bays and then like the other ones just super sharp so it just doesn't work.	O
So we're going to do the same thing with island which is going to hide that for now.	O
Select control and then select that.	O
So now you've selected the element and then you just add your mask over it and then we just do the exact same thing basically.	O
Just go around it and.	O
Mess it up.	O
Actually going to do like a little bit of a bigger brush here.	O
OK, that actually works out a lot better.	O

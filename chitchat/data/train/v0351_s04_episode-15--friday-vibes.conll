There we go.	CHITCHAT
See, I'm like that, just like dip in like in and out and all that.	O
Do you have a drawing tablet or just stick with keyboard?	O
I personally like to, um, stick with the keyboard and mouse.	O
It's not just it's not because I don't know how to use a drawing tablet.	O
I think I have one here somewhere.	CHITCHAT
It's just because I like to challenge myself.	CHITCHAT
Even like.	CHITCHAT
Even with when it comes down to like shortcuts and everything like I still, I still don't really use shortcuts that often either, only because like yeah, I just like to master like kinda everything about the software and I know that like shortcuts are like really helpful and everything, but like it helps.	O
It doesn't help me to teach a new learner to have all the shortcuts rather than just teaching them like how to actually access like the menu Excel.	O
So it just it just helps me out a lot longer and then like are a lot better and then people will be like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Sean, did you know that there was also a shortcut for what you taught me?	CHITCHAT
I'm like Yeah, but I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I didn't want to teach you the shortcut right away, like.	CHITCHAT
There's no loopholes, no loopholes in life do fully 1st, and then do the shortcuts.	CHITCHAT
8.	CHITCHAT
But a drawing tablet would like, yeah, obviously like speed up this process.	O
So like if you are used to using a drawing tablet like 100%.	O
But I can also use like the shift key to write and that and that will basically like do all my things that I need to.	O
OK, perfect.	CHITCHAT
Alright, now I'm just going to fill that in.	O
P select and then get rid of that perfect.	O
Less less beautiful but more.	O
Or landscape, right?	O
So let's now put our likes and.	O
Texture into here.	O
Let's see if it actually gives off like a sand texture.	O
If not I think I do have a say in texture somewhere.	O
Alright, that that should work.	O
What else OK?	CHITCHAT
So let's create clipping mask.	O
OK, and I'm just going to grab.	O
That color and then clip mask that into our sheep.	O
For non destructive and then I'm just going to grab now like the darker colors and then kind of just same with this brush, just kind of.	O
Click here in there.	O
OK, blur.	O
Perfect and then, uh, yet the shadows are off for that one.	O
OK, now I'm just going to place all my like elements around the edge like the grass and everything.	O
I'm basically just going to go around here because on the inside were just going to basically.	O
Play Sara land elements.	O
So right now we're just kind of focus just.	O
We're just focusing on the edge right here.	O
So I'm going to just go in here.	O
And grab that war.	O
I could do the puppet warp, but I'm just going to do this on.	O
OK, that works, and then I'm going to just now kind of bring it all in here, but I'm going to add a layer mask to this one.	O
And then just kind of use like a light brush around it.	O

Don't mind our, uh, from doing this right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to alter it.	O
I just want to bring like the water up to that level.	O
OK, now I'm going to go in and like kind of like perfect it.	O
Make sure there's no like harsh edges.	O
No, that's not it.	CHITCHAT
OK, great layer mask.	O
Will you be finalizing it today?	O
Why want to?	CHITCHAT
I mean I'd love to finalize it today.	CHITCHAT
Would be great if I did.	CHITCHAT
But just.	CHITCHAT
Hard, so let's see.	CHITCHAT
What will aim to well will aim to finish it, but I can't like guarantee it right.	CHITCHAT
There we go perfect.	O
And Yeah.	CHITCHAT
OK, and then I put that one at 50%.	O
OK, so now this kind of needs like.	O
Water ripples, right?	O
So let's see if we can find like an island element that we can put like just under it, like patchy anet will will see if we can make it look more realistic now that we have like our template of the heart and everything all down Pat.	O
I think I'm going to license this one.	O
Only 'cause I notice that like it has a darkness around it.	O
So what I need to do then is we need to grab this element here and bring it underneath their hearts.	O
And put that up.	O
And I'm going to just go around here.	O
Pull up our reference.	O
OK, so you kind of see like a little bit of.	O
Land underneath of it too, so we might have to grab some like rock assets.	O
OK, not going to sit down to hard light.	O
Yes, off for sure.	CHITCHAT
Then I'm going to.	O
Duplicate that perfect.	O
I'm just going to put this on like saturation's down a little bit.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
It's all looking.	CHITCHAT
The worst so far is looking pretty decent, like we're getting there.	CHITCHAT
It's, uh, it's going to be a slow like edit, but like it's getting there, right?	O
Like compared to what we were looking at before.	O
It's a whole lot better.	CHITCHAT
So now I'm just going to add.	O
In the adjustments here, I'm just going to do levels.	O
And I'm just going to kind of like dark and that's and a little bit.	O
And give it some.	O
You know a little bit of saturation.	O

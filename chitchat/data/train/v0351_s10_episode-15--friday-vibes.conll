Alright, I'm going to now just go into here.	O
I'm pretty sure that that color tone is off, so let's just put up the hard little bit.	O
Actually, let's go on to softly.	O
Reserved and soft light and let's crank this all way up.	O
No need like color.	O
One of these settings going to work.	O
Vividly.	O
And then will change the color of it maybe?	O
Oh, there we go.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK, now I'm going to do like the exact same thing too.	O
To this one.	O
Actually could probably just like.	O
Then And such a nondestructive editor.	O
It's great again.	CHITCHAT
Now it's bringing out our trees and stuff that's looking that's looking pretty good.	O
So far, what software are used for your 3D renders?	O
Uhm, so far, 3D.	CHITCHAT
Like all 3D stuff.	O
Normally it's either I get it off of like Adobe stock or I.	O
I just kind of like assume like I just make the 3D element out of other 3D elements, if that makes sense.	O
I don't really know how to make like a 3D element from ground up.	O
I'm working on that I'm working on getting like into that, but it's it's a lot of stuff because like we were really taught that stuff in my college like we did not get into 3D like at all.	O
And I think it really kind of set us back which sucks.	CHITCHAT
OK, and then I'm just going to bring that element back in here again.	O
'cause I've played with this one like way too much and warped and flipped it and.	O
Everything I'm just going to kind of like.	O
Use that as an example.	O
Forests.	CHITCHAT
A forest.	O
Alright, so now let's see if we can find like a like some trees or something.	O
Decimal drive pretty good.	O
Is there like multiple trees?	O
No, I think they only OK well that that 'cause I'm pretty sure the ether on islands.	O
I'm just going to add a bunch of just.	CHITCHAT
They want to start an Oak tree on their sure.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Alright, that should work.	O
Let's see if we can make any of these elements aerial.	O
OK, so now I'm just going to kind of like group all of this together.	O
Make it make a blue and then say like under I island.	O
Perfect and I'm just going to add a layer mask now.	O
To that group, and then I'm just going to go around with my eraser brush just to make it match the ripples again.	O
Kind of.	CHITCHAT
I think I have to just bring this one on top and clip mask it into their.	O

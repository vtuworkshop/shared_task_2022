Cool COO COO COO?	CHITCHAT
Actually, I don't like it with that one.	CHITCHAT
I like it like that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, perfect up and then what I'm going to do now is I'm just going to start placing trees.	O
Actually, let me just.	O
Package this for a second.	O
So we know where we're at.	O
So what is this?	O
OK, you can see like that.	CHITCHAT
This island ception You see the island underneath and I'll.	O
There's an island underneath that island.	O
Did you know that?	CHITCHAT
No Siri, I'm not talking to you.	CHITCHAT
Not talking to you right now.	CHITCHAT
Siri get outta here.	CHITCHAT
Stop interrupting me.	CHITCHAT
We can make these red.	O
Just that we know that they are the heart.	O
Get rid of that 'cause we licensed it now woo were fancy.	O
OK, so let's start placing these trees alright.	O
So pixel squid again.	O
Refresh it.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
See if we can make this a work for us.	O
And bring that to the very top.	O
Haha beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Remember that like the trees will never really be close to the water right?	O
Because trees want to survive, so they they just.	O
They don't want to get close to that at all.	O
And right now I'm just kind of doing like the outer.	O
Besides, first just keeping like will go in inside here later an like an ad like you know a small tree here or something just so that starts like blending it together.	O
But right now I'm just worried about getting around this side and then around that side 'cause it's easy just to plop a tree on top and blend that in like trees, Latin grow on top of each other all time.	O
So your main goal here would be just to just to edge.	O
This nicely.	CHITCHAT
And like I'm not worried about like shadowing or anything right now 'cause that's just like a final that I that I'll do at the end.	O
I'm just worried about laying out my project.	O
OK, and then we're just going to go right in here.	O
And then I'm just going to make like a light, nice little little tiny small guy in there.	O
Just as so difference right?	O
OK so let's see what that looks like so far.	O
Not bad, not bad.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
You'll have to walk the grab like some shadows and stuff, so I purposely made it so that my light is coming from over here.	O
So let's just get our lighting first.	O
Down Pat.	O
You know me, I like to.	CHITCHAT
I like to mark my lighting.	O
OK, so that is where my lighting is coming from lighting.	O
Hide that for now.	O
OK, now I'm just going to go over here.	O
Do the same thing to that side.	O
I might be able to just cheap it out and I might be able to just duplicate and swap, but.	O

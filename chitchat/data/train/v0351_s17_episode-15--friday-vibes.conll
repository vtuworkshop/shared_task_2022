And then we need to.	O
Blur that.	O
Cool and I am just going to put both of these into a folder and call it heart.	O
Create a clipping mask and clip it into that.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Grab a like dark brush.	O
Soft.	CHITCHAT
And then soft like that.	O
'cause you don't want it to look like you know.	O
Too realistic in certain parts and now in our forests here we're going to do like the exact same thing, basically.	O
Softly.	O
This one we're actually going to add like highlights to it though.	O
That Island is coming together.	O
Yeah, it is coming together pretty good.	O
I like it's not too.	CHITCHAT
It's not the worst like it is kinda like obviously it is like completely like a fake island, right?	O
'cause you can definitely tell that it is.	O
But like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know this.	CHITCHAT
I think it's kind of a cool technique to use personally.	O
OK, and then, uh, let's just kind of go down here.	O
Oh wait, no, you know you want to know why it looks so weird.	O
It's 'cause we didn't do the same thing to our mountains yet.	O
That's why I was like why is it so bright over here, OK?	O
That's why it's looking very unnatural is because this.	O
And then at the top.	O
We're going to do highlights.	O
OK, now I kind of got not have to create like some elements in here.	O
Just so like kind of fix it a little bit you know.	O
So let's grab some like little rocks.	O
Oh wait, I think I already grab that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah OK, I already grabbed him up, so let's go mountains and then yeah, let's.	O
Add this rubble in here.	O
Turn off the The Shadows and everything.	O
Yeah, it's coming together pretty good, uh?	O
Why am I a pretty easy, pretty easy to do, pretty easy technique.	O
There's stuff that could automatically do this for you, but like.	O
Where is that fan, that right?	CHITCHAT
This is just me, kind of like you know, perfecting that rock a little bit.	O
Cool and we can like.	CHITCHAT

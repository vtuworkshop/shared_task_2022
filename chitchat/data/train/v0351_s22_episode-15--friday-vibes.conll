I appreciate that I'm, uh, I'm happy that you guys like my work.	O
And I appreciate you the support and feedback.	O
Definitely definitely helps me expand.	CHITCHAT
And we all like expanding.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Right, that's the thing, right?	CHITCHAT
Set a trend.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you gotta keep your you gotta keep your pieces simple I learned when I was in school my teacher in photography always said keep it simple stupid.	O
You let him.	CHITCHAT
He literally added the word stupid because he liked to call it.	CHITCHAT
He's like kiss technique so or it was a kiss technique or something.	O
I don't know so you just have to kiss your image right so?	CHITCHAT
Keep it simple.	CHITCHAT
Keep it simple and people people will, uh.	O
Will get it.	O
Cancel review that.	CHITCHAT
And especially if I, if you post on like stuff like Instagram.	CHITCHAT
Like people don't really necessarily under understand like the UM.	O
The overall concept, yeah, you like my teacher.	CHITCHAT
Yeah he was, uh, he was a really good teacher.	CHITCHAT
He was a really good teacher.	CHITCHAT
He started me out in photography.	CHITCHAT
This is a long time ago though right?	CHITCHAT
So I've I've always uhm.	CHITCHAT
I've always kind of like followed that term like the Kiss technique and it works right.	O
It's just a.	CHITCHAT
It's all just the.	CHITCHAT
It's all just a game to kind of like, you know, make.	CHITCHAT
Make exactly what you what you want.	CHITCHAT
Uh, you messed up a bunch.	CHITCHAT
Like a lot, you're going to mess up like all the time.	CHITCHAT
Trust me happens or things mess up for you, right?	CHITCHAT
Because we are in the Internet era of things.	CHITCHAT
So apparently technology to states in general.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's up what time is it?	CHITCHAT
Oh, we are almost overtime so OK, so let's.	CHITCHAT
Grab all of our elements now.	O
OK, we've created a lot of layers for an hour or so, so that's where lighting is over there.	O
Going to remove that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
For now, uh, OK next stream, I'll actually let's just keep him in there.	O
Who cares?	CHITCHAT
I just need to fix this for a second.	O
Yes, and didn't come with a fancy shadow, so we gotta make it ourselves.	O
Pretty easy though.	O
Not too worried.	CHITCHAT
Overlay.	O
And actually, let's just do normal.	O
There we go just a match with everything else.	O
And then let's do are just a quick highlight.	O
Shift click.	O
Uh, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's do overlay for that one, and then let's crank that down.	O
Alright, that works Alright, so not just want to bring it in camera raw.	O
I know I could go in here and fix all small little details and all that stuff but like.	O
That's our reference.	O
Pretty good.	O
So let's grab all this.	O
And then I duplicate and I merge.	O
There's a a shortcut to doing all that easily, but.	O
Not going to worry about all right, so this is our final here that I that I crop.	O
I kind of always uh, you know, put it together at the end there it's always a good idea to just like merge it altogether.	O
Around like.	CHITCHAT
Around here like I would go in with like a high like a tool at the end, but let's just bring this into.	O

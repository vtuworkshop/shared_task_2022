Shifted around a little bit, make it make it look a little bit nicer.	O

You know, for an hour and so, like you know, you can go in and do and fix and tweak and and all that.	O
But I'm only going to teach you how to go from this to that.	O
Right, you could do that all rest stops here.	O
You could do everything else, but, uh.	O
But yeah, so pretty good I like.	CHITCHAT
For an hour so I mean like yeah, there's a lot of things that are that you can go in and you know you can go in and do all of your highlights and boots and Patch tool and clone and everything and fix and tweak all things to make it look more realistic.	O
But first, starting with you like you know, Yeah, new photo shop is faster 100% I 100% think that I just haven't updated yet because because I like the little blue icon right.	O
I like this.	CHITCHAT

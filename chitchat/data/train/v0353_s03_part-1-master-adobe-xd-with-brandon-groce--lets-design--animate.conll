Hey, what's going on can be a.	CHITCHAT
Hey thank you we Gucci what's going on my friend how you doing?	CHITCHAT
In this case, is pretty well these days, but in good way, yes, there's a lot happening nowadays, but we you know it's times like this where we can, you know, put everything aside, leave it on the outside world come to the Internet, be with good people, learn some great stuff and just chillax.	CHITCHAT
You know what I'm saying?	CHITCHAT
I love doing these things.	CHITCHAT
It keeps my mind off of anything that's going on the outside world, even though it's extremely hot.	CHITCHAT
'cause I got like 7 lights on me.	CHITCHAT
But other than that, like it's nice to, you know, get out of your comfort or your regular schedule.	CHITCHAT
Come, relax, come, listen to chill music with me and just design, you know.	CHITCHAT
Brian says if it costs more than $500, it's a dub.	O
I don't even know what that means, but they haven't bought a system in a long time.	O
My friend in a long long time we're going to do this first, so I like to because we are doing some copying here guys.	O
And out of curiosity besides everybody in the besides, I think it's.	CHITCHAT
In this car, I think you said that you were the one who's working on projects.	CHITCHAT
As anyone else working on anything.	CHITCHAT
I know Leona, I know that you're working on something you're constantly.	O
I was working on something you showed me something this morning.	O
I was like.	CHITCHAT
I should probably look at that.	CHITCHAT
So I'd love to know what you guys are up to in your day-to-day lives.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Trying to get this scale in which.	O
I'm in David put this together just so I can.	CHITCHAT
Can learn some stuff here all right and what I'm doing is I'm just scaling this up so I can basically see.	O
You know where his screen starts and stops and kind of do like a one to one recreation cool.	O
Nesconset exactly exactly.	O
Alright, so let's see.	CHITCHAT
We have some shapes here.	O
I'm going to turn the opacity of this down really quick just so we have.	O
I'm going to start building out some skeleton stuff here.	O
OK, I'm going to use this for reference.	O
Just large over here.	O
I'm just going to mass this and what I'm going to do, I'm going to scale this.	O
Leave it on the outside just so I have reference.	O
Color Wise, Alright cool.	O
I'm going to take the border off of this.	O
Take this color there's a lot of shadows in here and will deal with the shadows little bit later.	O
There's a lot of complexity with this guys, so we're going to do just to break it down is we're going to start with flat colors?	O
We're going to get our.	O
Are sliding components in.	O
We're going to get our buttons in, and this glowy effect, the new morphism is little new to me.	O
I know how-to-do-it basic form of it.	O
This looks like another level of it, so we're going to also probably look at some tutorials why we're doing it too, so.	O
Let's do it.	CHITCHAT
So we have our flat.	O
Fat color like this?	O
We're going to pull in.	O
A whole is going to start cutting some stuff out, pull out the border going to grab this color that looks like an ugly color.	O
This must.	CHITCHAT
This is the gradient, so we're going to start here.	O
We're going to also finagle it.	O
We're going to make it lighter and another thing guys.	O
For those of you guys who are.	CHITCHAT
I always struggle with color, So what I like to do not color hunt.	O
Leona is like her glasses.	CHITCHAT
Let's see and by the way, I would ever look no guys in the chat is, how's the stream going?	CHITCHAT
Is this stream lag ease the music goods?	CHITCHAT
My is my audio good.	O
Let me know because as you guys have known in the past.	CHITCHAT
Your boy had a lot of technical difficulties and one as we continue to do more and more of this, I wanted to get better for us, not worse as I continue to add more complexity to the stream.	CHITCHAT
So let's see, I'm going to kind of get some colors in here, so I'm gonna go to the generator.	O
This is something I use on all my projects because I'm so horrible at picking my own colors and this just saves time.	O
Leona, she totally give this to hairs.	CHITCHAT
I'm playing, so I'm going to put some colors here in the Swatch is.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just to see if I guess this would be RM between stage, So what I'm going to do is I'm going to try something really quick.	O

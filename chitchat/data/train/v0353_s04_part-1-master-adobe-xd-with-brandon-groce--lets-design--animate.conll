I'm going to go to our Phil, go to the solid section, linear gradient.	O
Make it work indeed.	O
And I'm going to select for a first color.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back linear go here.	O
Oh, you know what I'm going to do here?	O
Simple as this?	O
And this color to my palette.	O
Add this color to my problem.	O
And what I'm going to do now is going to hear linear gradient.	O
Pow.	CHITCHAT
Power will see what that looks like.	O
Close this close.	O
I think there's just a lot of shadows involved on top of it that makes it look like a different color, but we're going to stick with this right now.	O
Um anata Curiosity Leona you can uh?	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you're you're Gucci Hook here and I'm glad you joined.	CHITCHAT
I really thought you were not going to come.	CHITCHAT
You're like, yeah, you know I'm better than Brandon.	CHITCHAT
You know what I'm saying, but I'm glad you took some time out of your day to come in and relax and chill with us.	CHITCHAT
But Lyon, I'm curious, how is everything with?	CHITCHAT
I know you're looking at product design or product management.	CHITCHAT
You're doing something product related.	CHITCHAT
I know you're always trying to expand your skillset.	CHITCHAT
What are you looking into nowadays?	CHITCHAT
What has what is your fancy?	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna do another colors back here.	O
I'm going to duplicate this control C Control V probably could've just done like Control D.	O
Pull this all the way up.	O
Bring this all the way to the back.	O
Yes, we start with.	O
This is straight new morphism 100%.	O
We're going to try to create some of this stuff.	O
But bear with me.	CHITCHAT
This is going to be like our first is going to be our first date together.	CHITCHAT
Figuring out how this was created.	O
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
So we're just going to our flat stuff.	O
An and I know this font from somewhere.	O
I used it in the past.	O
Project going to open that really quick because.	O
I don't remember the font off the top of my head.	CHITCHAT
This is like our first live stream together or second.	CHITCHAT
With this, let's see.	CHITCHAT
That's another thing I panel trial I guess is the name.	O
There's some designers that can remember the names of fonts like they can call out the wrinkles in the back of their hand with the front of the.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what this is.	CHITCHAT
Like there's a lot of people that can recall like typography like color hex codes.	O
I'm like look listen, we don't need to do all that.	CHITCHAT
I just need to know how to make things look good and also make sure money is flowing into the business.	CHITCHAT
I'm saying so.	CHITCHAT
There's a whole different types of designers out here in the world I feel like.	CHITCHAT
And I'm ranting here.	CHITCHAT
But I feel like.	CHITCHAT
You don't need to know everything as a designer, which is.	CHITCHAT
Kind of counter intuitive.	CHITCHAT
I feel like all the people or designers that coach they mention, especially the ones who learn through platforms right?	CHITCHAT
Like I'm not going to name any course names, but you know.	CHITCHAT
Even even in the school system were taught that in order to learn, you have to go through Abcd all the way dizzy.	CHITCHAT
And that's not how.	CHITCHAT
True learning happenings happens, and even in the real world like some people will only have the knowledge to do a indeed and there really strong at A&D and because they are strong at those things, they're able to do certain things that other people can like.	CHITCHAT
For example, I'm very strong from a business side of things, pitching, selling myself, and I'm not the best like digital designer where all my friends for the most part.	CHITCHAT
Can out design main running circles around me, but you know I help bring them work because I know and have their relationships how to structure deals.	CHITCHAT
That's like my superpower, I guess, so not everybody has to be good at everything.	CHITCHAT
You just have to know your strength and go in on that.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
I just feel like I've been mentoring a lot of people today.	CHITCHAT
And this has been a recurring theme and I just think for those watching, you know it might be beneficial in some way.	CHITCHAT

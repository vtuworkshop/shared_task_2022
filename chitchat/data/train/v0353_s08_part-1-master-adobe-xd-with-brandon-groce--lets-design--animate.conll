What challenges did you have or what challenges you personally have?	CHITCHAT
If you want to keep it super simple and lean and be like, well, I think this could be this experience could be a little bit better by doing this and then you go and create your own version of what you wish existed within their application or their website and you create a case study over that.	O
The challenge that you faced or other people face that you ran in the scenario that you ran people through.	CHITCHAT
What is the solution that you believe can solve this?	CHITCHAT
How did you actually come about creating that solution?	O
And that's your case study.	O
Have the screenshots mock them up.	O
Have your own created mockups, mock those things up and create the process however you started with their application from where it is.	O
The process that you use, whether you test it via yourself or other people, and then um.	O
Brain farts just these two commands at this point.	CHITCHAT
And then you put that in the case studies so.	O
Where the application starts where you think you can better it or other people can believe it could be better and talk about the process from the challenge that exists.	O
What you think you can create a better it and describe the process you.	CHITCHAT
Did you come up with the solution?	O
But yes, that and go click on the link.	O
Leona did drop in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here it is mentioning was it kind of like the pros and cons of competitor sites.	O
You told me about based on the 10 main heuristics.	CHITCHAT
Oh Lord.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so that's when you start getting nitty gritty, like when you start bringing up the Neil.	O
The NN group like they bring different terms into the mix where it's like this word means that they just have a lack of whitespace.	O
Like Yeah, so basically targeting that goes in the case study in terms of the starting point of the project.	O
If the starting point in the project is.	O
Let's just talk this.	CHITCHAT
Go through this really quick.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let me pull up a 'cause y'all are asking this and I think this is a good will.	CHITCHAT
Make a video out of this.	CHITCHAT
Let me just.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go to Starbucks really quick.	O
Alright, so real quick we're going to talk about how to without without all the big words how to create a case study for a personal project of yours.	O
And let's just let's just start there.	O
OK, so I'm on the example here is I want to work for Starbucks and showcase.	O
I know how to think through a project.	O
OK so here, just like you mentioned it was going on date just like we talked about in our own mentoring sessions.	O
When you are looking at a competitor analysis or just taking a look at a problem in this space or in a space.	O
So Starbucks.	CHITCHAT
This is their home page.	O
We can take a look at it and say they do this really well.	O
They don't do this really well and from that we can say OK, the things that they do really well, they do really well in terms of ABC, the things that they don't really do really well are ABC and from that list of things that they don't do really well we can take that and create a project out of it.	O
We can say we saw A&B, they weren't done too well, so we're going to take it upon ourselves and create a project of that and make it even better.	O
So we start out with the challenge we found on Starbucks that A&B, where challenge and we're going to create a case or a project for ourselves to make it a better experience.	O
You can talk about your own experience with the process that you're talking about, or you can take in a real world if you want to make the project larger, you can take the bad examples or the challenges that you found, take them to other people, ask their opinion on what they think about it, which is basically interviews or user testing.	O
And you can say, OK, great.	O
But this is what I think these are.	O
Other people think.	CHITCHAT
Now I have a high kind of created a hypothesis on from all the data that I got.	O
With this experience, this is what people or I say could make it better.	O
Now let's actually build it.	O
Now the building part is the actually building portion of the learn build test model.	O
So we learned about it.	O
We asked ourselves with the challenges.	O
With that experience we asked others.	O
We did research on what other people are doing.	O
We created a hypothesis.	O
We now built something that we think will solve the problem and then we test it.	O
We go back to the people or selves and figure out you know.	O

Since, um.	CHITCHAT
Cinderella is pretty dainty.	O
I might just keep her hands really simple honestly.	O
Might not even draw any fingers.	O
Might just go like this.	O
Really welcome to the stream.	O
How are you so good?	CHITCHAT
Love seeing you life and action.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining in.	CHITCHAT
Having an interest in my work, I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
I might draw her thumb.	O
As thumbs are important.	O
Important for the human anatomy.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Really simple, yeah.	CHITCHAT
A lot of the time on my, um, airfare actors actually uh along time ago, I'll profess that sentence with this.	CHITCHAT
Along time ago I saw this character sheet.	O
It was an original character sheet for Winnie the Pooh for Disney, and it said only draw thumb when needing to hold things.	O
So if you watch poo very closely, they he has mittens.	O
And he has no fingers, no thumb.	O
But he only has a thumb drawn when he's holding something, and I took that into account that idea into account when drawing my own characters.	O
So if you look at any of my bear characters, they do not have any fingers unless they're holding something, and it's usually only at some do not draw fingers on any of my bears.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Um, the more I draw humans, I'm trying to take that into account and just keep really simplistic shapes.	O
Even though my natural instinct is to.	CHITCHAT
Just like broad, complexly and again like that's not really the style that I want to go for, so I really have to try to force myself to stick to simplistic shapes I constantly have to remind myself.	O
Serious, what in the world did you just say?	CHITCHAT
Yippee.	CHITCHAT
Other buckets.	CHITCHAT
What?	CHITCHAT
I think I might actually, there's like this big space right here.	O
And I feel like it's kind of awkward.	O
I think I'm going to move the UM, brush up there instead of words.	O
It's Russian.	O
Russian for what?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Wanna shapre facing more?	O
Bring much.	CHITCHAT
What the canvas back the other way?	O

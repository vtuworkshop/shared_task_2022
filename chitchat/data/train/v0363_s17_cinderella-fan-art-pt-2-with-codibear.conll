Look shiny, but I can't do that until after I've colored it because basically all color it and then I'll just flip the copy.	O
The layer and then I'll flip it over and then lower the Opacity and then you have an instant reflection.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
This is one of my favorite scenes all.	O
Thank you so much, Amy.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it's.	CHITCHAT
I think it's going to look pretty good once we start the coloring process.	O
Let's put some more little sparkles.	O
The Bible where it is.	CHITCHAT
Hum OK?	CHITCHAT
OK, let's go ahead.	CHITCHAT
Don't need that layer and dense all these layers sketch layers down.	O
Need that layer.	O
The coloring process is my favorite part.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Sketching Don't really care for it.	O
A coloring love it.	O
Oh, here's the thumbnail that we started out with.	O
Oh my gosh, look how bad it looks.	O
Are you?	CHITCHAT
OK, let's split the whole thing just so we can see, uhm, we like what we're looking at.	O
Sit back and enjoy it for a second uhm.	CHITCHAT
I think I might move the brush.	O
Zoom out.	O
I think we're looking pretty good.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I always color code my sketch layers is blue.	O
And see which an.	CHITCHAT
Let's lower the Opacity now.	O
So in the original movie, this scene is very cool color.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Print out did I Excel?	O
This week So this scene is very cool, toned and I don't typically work with cool tones.	O
I pretty much always work with warm tones with a little bit of splash of blue in there every once in awhile, so we are actually going to be doing this scene in all warm tones.	O
Um, but I'm going to be basically working from this color palette, but using my own colors that I usually use in my artwork, like for instance, instead of this cool colored.	O
Gray and white for the walls were going to be doing a cream warm cream color instead.	O
Nice Golden ratio.	O
do I have a Golden ratio?	O
I didn't even mean to.	CHITCHAT
That was not intentional.	O
But I think it looks it looks pretty.	O

I feel I feel like she's the focal point, which is what I was hoping for.	O
I was afraid that when I first did this illustration at the background would end up being the focal point, but I think that.	O
I think it looks pretty good.	O
OK, let's make a group.	O
Uhm, I think I'm going to start with the floor.	O
That's the biggest part.	O
Uhm?	CHITCHAT
So the floor is like.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
Dark teal color uhm.	O
Like a dark Ty Lee Green.	O
And also like Navy.	O
Figure out what we got going on so I do have a Navy in my palette.	O
Let's start with that.	O
And so typically I work with a cran brush.	O
These days for my artwork and I like to try to make my artwork look as traditional as possible instead of digital.	O
So despite the fact that I work in multiple layers, I try to make it look like I didn't work in multiple layers.	O
So instead of painting over the column like this, I actually like to paint around my objects so it looks like I actually used a real cran to color.	O
So this color is kind of dark.	O
Pretty Dang dark, but.	O
That's OK because with digital art it's really dumb.	O
It's really forgiving and allows you to experiment.	O
all I have to do is lock the transparency of the layer to change colors, which is what I do a lot.	O
A lot of the time when I'm working.	O
I usually don't.	O
Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Finish with the colors that I started with Because I like to experiment a lot while I'm working.	O
So I'm going to put this color down.	O
And then afterwards we can just lock the transparency of the layer an we can just brush straight over those strokes that I already made and change the color and try out different colors.	O
So I'm probably going to end up.	O
Making this color a little bit lighter.	O
I don't want to detract from Cinderella and if I leave this color this dark, I think we will end up detracting from the focal point of the image.	O
Because there will be a lot of contrast between this really dark color along the edge of the tile and the white walls.	O
I'm probably not going to make this as dark as it is right now.	O
Also, um, to add texture to my work.	O
I also try really hard to save my whites and leave white texture and between all of my strokes I use a smaller brush.	O
And I also.	O
Uh, try to paint in different directions so we can get that texture in different angles.	O
And since the bubbles are transparent, I am actually going to paint over them since we will be able to see through them anyway.	O
Coloring is so cathartic to me because.	O
Because it just literally just feels like I'm coloring in coloring book, specially with the cran brush.	O

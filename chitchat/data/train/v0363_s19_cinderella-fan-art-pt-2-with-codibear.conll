A Clarissa Hi, welcome to the stream.	O
Can you say again which brush do you use?	O
I like it a lot.	O
It is a Kyle Webster brush.	O
You can get it for free if you have um Adobe CC.	O
It is called Contact Fran.	O
I will type it in chat really quick so you can have the spelling of it.	O
And you can find it in the in the, UM, megapack specifically.	O
If you've never downloaded Kyle's brushes, I will show you how to do it.	O
If you just go up to the brush menu here and you go to the gear and go down to what is it it is.	O
Wait, why do I?	CHITCHAT
Should there should be get more brushes?	O
Oh, there it is.	CHITCHAT
So I just right clicked with my brush in hand, went to the gear and get more brushes and then that will open up your browser.	O
And here is the age where you can download all of these are packs of Kyle Websters brushes.	O
You can get the contact grain from the Mega Pack here.	O
The first one I also allow the time will use his watercolor brushes too.	O
Yeah, I love the texture on this cran brush.	O
I've only been using it for like around 8 months or so.	O
Every once in awhile, like I'll do my, I'll do my artwork with a certain curtain brush for a certain amount of time, like maybe a few years or something, and then I'll just like try try out different textures and see if I like anything else and that is how I found this grand brush.	O
Yeah, no problem Clarissa.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it adds like a much more like handmade, rustic vibe to my work, which is something that I really strive for.	O
That's another reason why.	O
Despite the fact that I'm a digital, artists are really try to make my work look as traditional as I can.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I just I just like the handmaid's look.	O
Tip with this brush.	O
Also when I first started using this brush I had a tendency to like.	O
My natural instinct was to want to fill in all of the white and also if you use a big brush, obviously it's going to fill in all the white 2 and you don't really want that like right when you use this brush because the texture is are the reason you're using it, so it kind of defeats the purpose of using it if you're going to fill in all the white.	O
So my suggestion is using a really small brush and just kind of like crawling in a bunch of different directions like this.	O
Or you can do like swirls and that will give you a different.	O
A texture you know, like zigzags or like cross hatching like this.	O
But just kind of like you'll get a feel for it after You used it for awhile.	O
I know I have you just kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Very likely, like I'm hardly even touching my tablet.	O
Right now, I'm just doing a very light hand.	O
The kind of like this allow that white to show through, and if you feel like there's too much white, it's always easier to go back.	O
Anne, just fill in the white rather than having to like erase the section and then come back and like add in more white.	O
So I always say it's easier to add back in or I'm sorry it's always easier to come back and fill it in rather than add it back in later.	O
And I love using the cran brush for like outlining details to like I'll probably do the bubbles as an outline like this.	O
I just feel like it adds really, really nice texture and it just looks like it's like it's hand drawn.	O
I mean technically it is and wrong, but you know what I mean.	O
It gives that vibe of like this was drawn by a little kid, but it wasn't.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So as I said earlier, this color is probably going to be way too dark.	O

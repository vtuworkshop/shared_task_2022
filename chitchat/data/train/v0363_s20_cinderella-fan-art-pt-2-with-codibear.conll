Um, so let's lighten that up a bit.	O
Probably do I want to do saturated.	O
So if you don't know how to lock the transparency of a layer, all you gotta do is go up to this little.	O
Little checkerboard icon right next to the lock word and you can see it adds a little lock onto your layer.	O
And I usually just take the hard round brush because it it it's a process is faster on the computer rather than a texture brush and what locking the transparency does is it allows you to paint in areas where you have already previously painted and not outside of that area.	O
So here I'll just do a really bright color so you guys can see.	O
So it saves the texture and I can try out a bunch of different colors.	O
This way, without worrying about ruining my work that I already did.	O
Traditional materials, yeah, exactly.	O
Hand drawn with traditional materials.	O
Oh stretch.	CHITCHAT
I think it's time stretch my wrists.	CHITCHAT
Oh also, I haven't saved the entire time I've been working, so um, don't be like me.	CHITCHAT
Save your work frequently.	O
Do some wrist stretches when you can.	O
Also, don't be like me and get RSI in my.	CHITCHAT
In my drawing hand.	CHITCHAT
Do as I say, not as I do that kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
Their RSI.	CHITCHAT
Stretches Get your fingers moving.	O
Touching the shoulder helps also.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Now the question in my head is you draw the Grout or to not draw the Grout that is.	O
Oh, I do want to draw the ground actually, because it's the same color as the border and the diamond tiles.	O
So yes, we will outline with that alert.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
It could probably just do this all on the same layer, because the floor is going to be underneath everything.	O
Hum, I don't really.	CHITCHAT
He was separated out.	O
Any reason, oh?	CHITCHAT
Grab the pen.	O
Miss color again.	O
I'll who knows if I'll end up changing this Navy color again.	O
I probably will.	CHITCHAT
Depending on the other colors that I use in the image, we will see.	O
What works and what doesn't?	O
This way.	CHITCHAT
Do these vertical.	O
Relative right now they're vertical lines before they were horizontal lines.	O
I keep accidentally like flicking my canvas when I go to move it.	O

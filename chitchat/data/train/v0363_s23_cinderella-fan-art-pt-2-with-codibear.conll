Like one of the parameters.	CHITCHAT
OK, it looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Um, I don't know how I feel about the colour yet.	O
I guess we'll see once I figure out what color I should do for.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
For the tiles themselves, because they're kind of like, uh, like I said, like a greenish teal color.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
End up like this color.	O
It will layer underneath.	O
But I want it to be warmer.	O
It would be an interesting counterpoint.	O
Yeah, you know that's very true.	O
I feel like on one hand.	O
Is probably not looking for children's illustrator, but on the other hand.	O
There probably aren't going to be very many children's illustrators.	O
This sign up for something like that, so maybe it would make my style stand out, but you know, I don't know, I don't know.	O
So I'm feeling like I'm going to let's lower the opacity of my brush to 50%.	O
Boom, no, not that color.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's I need to warm it up somehow.	O
Let's up.	CHITCHAT

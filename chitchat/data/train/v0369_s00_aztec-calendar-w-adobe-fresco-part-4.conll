Like I said, this DTM and I've been working on this astek calendar.	O
For a few sessions now.	CHITCHAT
And the goal is to have a complete outline ready to go.	O
So let me go ahead and get back into it and see what we gotta do here is time to stack some layers.	O
So we have.	O
This to build together can on layers.	O
This stack it up boom.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what you call it.	CHITCHAT
I guess you call it folders, but they're not really folders because, uh.	O
They are from.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of like a stack.	O
Now I would like to see in Frisco in uh, illustrator, Photoshop, maybe a photo shop that's already there.	O
RC the layers panel like we're used to on the desktop.	O
'cause then that way you can.	O
Put the layers in a folder.	O
Minimize that folder, expand that folder you know.	O
And uh, and then make sure that it doesn't take up as much space.	O
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
Alexandra was happening.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you are here.	CHITCHAT
And then let me leave a thumbs up on my.	CHITCHAT
Drawing and we got down on my video.	CHITCHAT
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
So now it's time to work on the outside, so I went ahead and stacked.	O
Some of these layers, let's turn on.	O
The Aztec calendar yes, Oh dear.	O
So it's time to work on the days I think these are the days and that's what I meant to do before going live.	O
Was look for my book.	O
I have a book.	O
Oh, that explains all of this, but these are the days these right here all the days.	O
Different days and.	O
That looks like guitar chords, so let's see what we have that's that line.	O
This line who?	CHITCHAT
So let's merge that down and then above that boom is going to be today.	O
So then this one is that line.	O

A little ways down.	O
Not that far.	CHITCHAT
2.	O
One more missing.	O
Oh, that's on this.	CHITCHAT
Turn that off there we go see now this that together and making sure that song my layers are organized because it's getting to the point where it's going to be a lot of layers.	O
But I don't want to merge merge them all.	O
There's some things that I wanted to submit it thing that needs to happen and so.	O
So I kind of want to keep it clean enough.	O

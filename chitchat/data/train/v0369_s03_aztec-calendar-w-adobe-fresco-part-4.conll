All you do this, the challenges OK cool Mommy.	CHITCHAT
So then are you on the discord.	CHITCHAT
You know they have a discord.	CHITCHAT
Come on.	CHITCHAT
My can I paste it?	O
There it is, that's the arm.	O
Yeah, illustrator challenge in Soum if you wanna do like stuff for fun and uh.	O
In that learning skills like I did the challenge today.	O
And uh, in illustrator.	O
And then following that challenge young this cartoon.	O
Is during the illustrated discord today the I've been on the photo shop one for awhile and I don't do any of those challenges.	O
I just like to what do you call that fear missing?	CHITCHAT
Now?	CHITCHAT
I'm just so that I, you know, I feel like I'm.	CHITCHAT
Not missing something out.	CHITCHAT
Any case when I did that illustrated challenge today.	O
Um, there's a cool things that I have not tried in illustrator.	O
And when it comes to my work, I don't need to know how to do everything, just enough to.	CHITCHAT
Do the art.	CHITCHAT
Lamb paint do.	CHITCHAT
Like I've been working on some beer labels for a local brewery here in Georgia.	O
And so they're starting to make the labels.	O
Now they're starting to to make the beer.	O
With the new artwork now, so getting pretty close to be able to share the.	O
Share the artwork on be hands.	O
But I already had my process.	O
I know what I'm doing now.	O
I know how to do what I know how to do, but by following some of these.	CHITCHAT
Some of these challenges you know, you get to experience some of the other different tools that I don't necessarily try.	O
And then, uh, and so once I finish the challenge, I went ahead and posted it on Instagram and Twitter in A tag.	O
Um, the artist who did the demo?	CHITCHAT
What is her name?	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Clarity her name is cloudy.	CHITCHAT
AMA and so, uh, yeah answer when I posted it on Twitter she got it because I tagged or she got a notification and then.	CHITCHAT
She went ahead and um and shared my artwork on her Instagram, so that was kind of cool, you know?	CHITCHAT
Part of my reasons for doing.	CHITCHAT
Community art Is, uh.	CHITCHAT
Is to get my name out there, you know.	CHITCHAT
Just continue to build.	CHITCHAT
My brand.	CHITCHAT
And guys, so when I did this.	CHITCHAT
This challenge I just did the same normal thing and I always do is share on social media.	CHITCHAT
I did not expect anybody to pick it up or share it, so sometimes sometimes that's a cool thing.	CHITCHAT
Nana says.	CHITCHAT
Wow, that's great.	CHITCHAT
Yeah man, you gotta get in, get in, get in, get in.	CHITCHAT
Now be says only challenges sometimes look boring but you never know you might pick a new tool or cool trick to apply.	CHITCHAT
Or yeah, cloudy yeah from free my soul.	CHITCHAT
Yep, that's right.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, she's cool.	CHITCHAT
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and you know what Mommy?	CHITCHAT
I agree with you, um, I never really gotten into the challenges because they do look boring like I don't want to make that.	CHITCHAT
That's how I feel like sometimes like, Nah, that does.	CHITCHAT
That's not interesting to me, but I'm gonna tell you this.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Years ago here I've got a couple of stories.	CHITCHAT
Get a couple of Adobe Creative Cloud stories.	O
Years ago, when, um, Adobe draw was knew.	CHITCHAT
An Adobe draw just got an update.	O
Yesterday I think it was yesterday.	CHITCHAT
And the whole creative cloud got an update in I think.	CHITCHAT
Well, the other day it wasn't.	CHITCHAT
Yesterday was a few days ago.	CHITCHAT
So in any case, Adobe draw yet we all support each other and it's always a win win.	CHITCHAT
Corect Maui, which is.	CHITCHAT
Well, yeah, that that was that.	CHITCHAT
That's that's what that story was about with cloudy is that she shared it and now you know people who know her are getting a taste of who I am.	CHITCHAT
And then they're going to come looking around an ultimately at the end of the day away.	CHITCHAT
I look at it is, you know.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I'm going to learn a new tool.	CHITCHAT
Something else that I did not know or had not tried.	CHITCHAT
In a software that a teacher teach illustrator.	CHITCHAT

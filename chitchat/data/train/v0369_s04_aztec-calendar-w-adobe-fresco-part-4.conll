But then at the same time you know you never know who's paying attention, who's watching and what kind of side benefits you're going to get.	O
And that's where my other story is going.	CHITCHAT
The one my creative cloud story.	CHITCHAT
Uh, it's going and in so I'm going to tell that story with the idea that you know unexpected things happen when you involve yourself in the community and then build rapport with other artists and designers and so on, because even the beer project that I've been working on an it's several beers, like right now we're at 6 beer labels and I gotta start another one tomorrow.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Those referrals come from people in the industry who know you and that they seen your work.	O
You know, not just your fans, you know, friends, family, even online followers and stuff.	CHITCHAT
But I'm talking about professionals in the field who see you putting in work and then they're going to be like, Oh yeah, you know, get get with my.	CHITCHAT
My Homie Maui.	CHITCHAT
They'll take care of you.	CHITCHAT
And uh, and next thing you know you doing some cool projects with companies that you would not normally come across.	O
But somebody that who knows you've been watching you put your name up and now here you are working on something.	O
So that's that.	CHITCHAT
That got me thinking today.	CHITCHAT
I felt like I wanted to just try out a challenge in the reality is, you know, I look at everything as as an opportunity to get involved and get my name my brand further out and so when I saw the challenge that I had started a week ago or so.	O
I said As cool But at the end of the day, what I would like to do is, uh.	CHITCHAT
Get my my be hands in another Gallery like right now the other day I got a notification that my one of my pieces or one of my posts on Behance has made it into that Adobe illustrator on the iPad app and so the app is not out in public yet.	O
It's in beta still some of us are in that data.	O
But that means that when it does make it out into.	CHITCHAT
It's in released to the public, then my artwork is going to be part of the app and then more people going to see my work.	O
So I saw that Adobe Illustrator challenge has a page on be hands where they pick some of those pieces.	O
Some of those be hands projects to include him on the page.	O
So I want to be on that page.	O
So I kind of have a self serving reason for doing stuff sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Buttom Should I do details details?	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking about this right now, no details, none of these details, you know what?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll leave the.	CHITCHAT
The scales, but not the details in the rattlesnake.	CHITCHAT
So so I got questions I still got.	CHITCHAT
I mean I got a story to tell, but uhm, let me go ahead and see what Nana's question is.	CHITCHAT
What is the source image so?	O
Unfortunately, and this is one of the reasons why I'm doing this project.	O
Is that, uh?	CHITCHAT
If you look up.	O
On the Internet you know.	O
To Add to calendar, you're going to find a ton.	O
Of images.	O
So sometimes when I'm looking for references for my work as a lot of my work is aspect.	O
Inspired, I am born in East Delhi but my parents are from Mexico.	O
I lived in Mexico, studied the Astic culture.	O
For a long time and there's still more studying that I'm doing now to to get.	O
Deeper into it.	O
And so when I saw a lot of my artwork, is astic related an when I'm looking up references I find.	O
Um, either low resolution images like this one, yes, now yes.	O
And then, uh.	CHITCHAT
Low resolution images like this one or images that are half way put together and do not match.	O
The original art, and then it's hard to figure out like What is this what is going on here?	O
What is happening in this area?	O
What is that?	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's, uh, not.	CHITCHAT
And so as an artist you know you try to decipher what you're looking at and at the end of the day, these are all the references you have available.	O
So what I want to do is recreate a lot of this artwork that I see that I know about and clean it up and make a high resolution.	O

Vector.	O
That, uh, that I'll share freely like I just throw the ball out there for anybody to use.	CHITCHAT
Let go ahead.	CHITCHAT
But I'm also going to do with some of this.	O
Some vector artwork is make T shirts.	O
You know, print things out that I want that I want to order now because the see cool things online.	O
But the art is just not not what I'm willing to pay money for.	O
So I want to make the artwork.	O
Um, dead.	CHITCHAT
I will use as my reference.	O
I want to clean it up, make it better and then uh, and then even make prints if I want to.	O
So that's the story behind what's happening.	O
I know that's a long answer, Nana, but but yeah, uh, that this is an image you can find on line.	CHITCHAT
There is a book.	CHITCHAT
I have a book.	O
I have a poster of an image similar to this one, but some of those details are off.	O
Anytime you look at a different calendar.	O
The details a little.	CHITCHAT
Their friends, some things have been changed and it's not that, um, the person was not a good artist who drew it is just that sometimes we don't go deep enough into the research to understand what we're looking at so that we can make a good representation of that old artwork and what it's supposed to be.	O
So there you go, long story.	O
But yes, uh, thank you for asking.	CHITCHAT
So now, um, obviously is so true.	CHITCHAT
Redoing those or logo.	O
So maybe one day like somebody likes it and says hey, I want that for my company and with digital you never know who can go viral.	O
That's right and that's a cool Congress.	O
That's right, Moby.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah man.	CHITCHAT
Really positive true.	CHITCHAT
An interesting story.	CHITCHAT
Keep on coming.	CHITCHAT
OK cool.	CHITCHAT
I got some stories for you.	O
But but it's so back to that other part is that you know when I saw that the Adobe Illustrator Challenge had.	O
There was, uh, I think it was said where did I see in a side and a discord, but not the	O
Uhm, I saw it somewhere and it was not the illustrated discord.	O
But I saw it said, hey, uh, make sure you tag when you post your be hands to tag.	O
Use the #ai Um creative challenge.	O
Is in for a chance for us to go ahead and add it to the Gallery to the illustrator Gallery or something like that.	O
and I was like, well I want to be in that Gallery so so then that got me looking around.	O
And So what that illustrator challenges about.	O
I gotta make a album cover and I I can do that and then but but what I ended up doing was watching a mum.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Also girls name again.	O
Dang, I forgot her name already.	CHITCHAT
Uh, you never know cloudy and so and so.	O
Then I cyclon ES video and it's like, well, I could do my own thing or I can watch your video.	O
And of course to the challenge to answer poses as I just do it just do the challenge and then I watched your videos.	O
Now that's cool.	CHITCHAT
And then, uh, and so then I did my peace, and so on.	O
And that's where the rest of the story came from.	O
So I learn something new and I am interested in making sure that my art gets featured in as many different places as possible.	O
Because Yes, you never know who's watching, uh, and what kind of effect your?	O
Your presentation, your skills is going to have.	O
On someone who needs your talents.	O
And just like this beer people, you know they reached out to me because they heard from me from one person.	O
That one person told another person.	O
The other person then mention my name and next thing you know.	O
You know I'm working on these beer labels so.	O
That's that's how that's what I want for my art career to just keep pushing out.	O
Good work.	CHITCHAT
Getting in where I can and then getting the eyeballs that I need on my work so that somebody just says how much then how much money you need.	O
What do you want?	O
Not well.	CHITCHAT
How much you got.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
And I get to keep drawing, just drawing look, I'm just drawing, getting paid to draw.	O
All right, so here goes a story.	O
Um and This is why I'm very interested in making sure that I am involved with an up-to-date in.	O
In pain, attention to what's happening on line, specially today right now, since you know a lot of stuff we can't do in person.	O

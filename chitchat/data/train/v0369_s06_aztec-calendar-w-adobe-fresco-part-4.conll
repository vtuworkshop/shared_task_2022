But even before in real life is going to be tough to to run into.	O
Cloudy, right?	CHITCHAT
You're not going to run into her unless you're working on a project or somebody told her about you or she happens to be at a speaking event and so on.	O
So the Internet makes it really possible for us all to come across each other an find each other so.	O
Years ago I scored aside following the Twitter for creative cloud along time ago and um, in this is when so it happened that.	O
This time there was a Adobe draw which is similar to fresco.	O
And a lot of things that Frisco has Adobe draw has is, uh.	O
Is a drawing app on iOS and Android.	O
In so Adobe draw.	CHITCHAT
They were doing a lot of promotions for Adobe draw and Twitter in a son.	O
I think it was on Twitter.	O
They posted one of the videos.	O
There were live streaming on YouTube in this before.	O
Behance really had the video platform but they were on YouTube and talking about Adobe draw there's a couple amazing artists.	O
Oh, I forgot his name.	CHITCHAT
But there's a couple of great artists who who can get down on Adobe draw.	O
I mean, these guys are just amazing.	O
And, uh, and so I was watching one of the videos and they said, uh, hey uh, we gotta contest.	O
Post your artwork on Twitter.	O
Hashtag it and, uh, we give an awesome prizes, including some posters you know featuring the artwork or such as such artist was like, Alright, That's cool.	O
And it so happened that they said, you know, we want to see you do an illustration with featuring a beard.	O
And of course I have a beard and sometimes it let it grow, sometimes it's trim it up.	O
And I said, Oh, I have a perfect drawing.	O
So I did a quick drawing an uploaded it to post it on YouTube and I said that's that.	O
So there's my entry done.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
A day or two goes by.	O
And then I get a tweet saying Hey ya.	O
Check your DMS and or follow so I can send you the end.	O
Something like that, something weird.	CHITCHAT
That's alright COO COO COO I realized that it was one of the Adobe people.	O
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
And so I am so I did.	CHITCHAT
And uh, and I checked the message, so I checked the message and it said, hey, you want to Fry's click the link to fill out your info?	O
And dumb and it said you want a prize and I kept in and immediately I thought, man, I probably want to post her.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to post her.	O
You know, I want I want something good.	O
I and I and I was thinking to myself if I have one, something good that would have said, hey, you want something good not fill this thing out to redeem you know so it's like yeah well I said to myself I'm going to click on the link in if it's not something that I want I'm just gonna.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to just go ahead and.	O
Not fill it out like I don't care.	O
Something's happening to my pin, what is?	O
And so so I click on the link and, uh, Indiana page is a form and the form says you want a complementary creative cloud subscription.	O
Filature info, not like what?	O
So that's the first time I want a creative cloud subscription.	O
And it was just through participation.	O
That's it, you know, and I don't know if they got a lot of entries that did not pay attention.	O
You know how many entries there were?	O
Who submit it?	O
what I just did my submission and moved on.	O
And so, but there I want something that was cool.	O
I am submitted my info, they sent me a code and bam, free creative cloud account, nice.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
That's my story, and my point is that you know it's just so easy to participate, you're going to draw you like drawing.	O
I like drawing and you telling me that I just, you know, I can submit one of my drawings and then I can get something out of that.	O
You know, from from a company, an software that I actually use all the time, like I'm down with that.	O
Alright, so that's the first story.	O
The first time I want to create a cloud.	O
Let me tell you about the second time.	O
I want to create a cloud account.	CHITCHAT

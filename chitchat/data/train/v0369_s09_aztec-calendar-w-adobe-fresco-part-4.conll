So as I as cool.	CHITCHAT
Plus 2019 was a rough year and it would have been very tough to do what I needed to do.	CHITCHAT
And then this year just ran out of time and then next thing I know the whole residency program disappeared.	O
And in death, because the pandemic came around and so now Adobe said.	O
Well, instead of doing the residency program like they did in the past, they doing it this way.	O
And now it's like, oh, perfect.	CHITCHAT
And so, uh?	CHITCHAT
So I submit it.	CHITCHAT
My proposal is not a lot of writing.	O
And you have two options.	O
You can either create your own project an.	O
Try to get funded for your project or you can choose to do a.	O
Adobe Creative Cloud Commission.	O
They'll Commission you.	CHITCHAT
And, uh.	O
And I don't know anybody who is doing these who's gotten approved.	O
I don't know anybody personally, just myself.	O
I'm the only one I I know whose kind, approved and I share these links with tons of people.	O
So who knows if anybody is applying.	O
In any case, I got approved and we've been in.	O
Doing lots of meetings and discussions as to the process and you know.	O
A lot of.	CHITCHAT
Helpful tips an things that Adobe wants to see an I am doing my own personal project so I asked to do my own personal project and my project is to draw a coloring book featuring.	O
UH-100 pencils.	O
And 100 pencils in the sense that they are.	O
They could be pencils, markers, uhm.	O
Paint brushes everything and anything that a artist uses to create.	O
This my project and it's a coloring book so so I don't have to do any coloring and shading.	O
There is no flats, there's no gradients, nothing, just the actual drawing.	O
You know, and so I got approved and there it is, boom.	O
So yes.	CHITCHAT
I encourage anybody who's listening to me right now who can hear my voice?	O
To go ahead and apply, why not go ahead?	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Just wanted to make sure I share that link.	O
And if you apply let me know.	O
I want to.	CHITCHAT
I want to celebrate you getting in.	CHITCHAT
I am.	CHITCHAT
May I just want to draw?	O
That's that's basically it.	O
I want to draw.	O
If I could just draw all the time.	CHITCHAT
That's it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm trying to clean up some of these lines here.	O
So many there it is.	CHITCHAT
I'm an Adobe fresco.	O
There it is.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
And it is a lot of detail.	O
That's why I have to talk.	O
When I'm drawing 'cause otherwise, you'll take a look down at yes, do it.	O
Do it.	CHITCHAT
Just remember this when you're writing out your ideas.	O
Make sure you include the fact that you are going to share and social media.	O
Um Oh yes Anna she S Anna Nana got the residency last year two years ago or yeah something like that.	O
It was 2018 'cause I've been paying attention for a while.	O
I was at Adobe Mask Mask, Adobe Max in 2018 doing live art and uh and she is one of the people I drew.	O
Ximena not paid attention to me because I was.	CHITCHAT
This is trying to get in where I fit in.	O
But yes, uh-huh and I've actually downloaded her.	O
Proposal so that I could study where other artists say and what they plan to do so I can write one.	O
That's that's, you know, as cool as that.	O
Uh, huh?	CHITCHAT
But for the residency this year, would I want you to think about is that?	O
Is that you have to include social media engagement and your proposal like like in my example I said and I'm going to live stream my process on B hands.	O
I'm going to share screenshots on Instagram and Twitter and so on so that way.	O

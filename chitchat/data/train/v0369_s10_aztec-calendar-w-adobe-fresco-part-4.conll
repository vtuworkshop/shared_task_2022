And then I'm gonna and I said I'm gonna use illustrator for iPad.	O
Why you so loud illustrator for iPad?	CHITCHAT
And I'm gonna use illustrator and Indesign and and I'm going to live stream.	O
And then I'm going to edit the videos and premiere.	O
And so of course I'm used to all of that.	CHITCHAT
I know how to do those things, but all of that in your pitch.	O
Um shows that.	CHITCHAT
You can, uh, promote Adobe, some kind of way indirectly.	O
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
So, um, she's super talented, uh, we're talking about.	O
Anna Davis on Anna Davis court.	O
She's super talented, she does amazing Magic, Pixar style of paintings can apply.	O

I just like brands and logos.	O
I don't have anything to pitch that yes you do.	CHITCHAT
Mommy, don't let me don't get me started on man really.	CHITCHAT
I helped her to get some snacks she could not get.	O
I emailed quick quick Quaker and Can you believe she got her snacks?	O

A mom, and she never.	CHITCHAT
She never responded.	O
She didn't like the tweets than anything, and so I I, I I.	O
I'm sure she was busy, that's all.	CHITCHAT
And it was a very crazy time leading up to Adobe Max, so so you know things can get hectic.	O
Uhm, but I'll be a Nana.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thumbs up, I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think every anybody.	CHITCHAT
Everybody has something that can.	O
Nick and pitch you can pitch.	O
Here's an idea, right?	CHITCHAT
and I don't not.	CHITCHAT
Looking at your profile picture, be hands right now.	O
I'm just in general.	CHITCHAT
At the very basic level.	O
You can.	O
Pitch.	O
A, uh?	CHITCHAT
Five to six step.	O
Uh workflow process.	CHITCHAT
Worksheet Or Worksheets.	O
Like an infographic.	O
And in that process, and then those sheets you describe your creative process when revamping a brand.	O
Like the are the chips.	CHITCHAT
I said And so I have a a website called that creative geniuses, just like my brand name on be hands dot creative genius.	O
Dot com forward slash process and so I have a page where my creative process and so when I talk to my clients and there telling telling me about the artwork they want for me and so on so forth, I tell him OK, will check out my created my process so that you know that I'm going to send you an ugly drawing first, then a cleaner drawing and then finally a final drawing.	O
In so I describe my process in steps so that people know what to expect.	O
And so you have, so you must have a process for your work.	O
And, uh, and if you were to say to saying, OK, Adobe what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a step by step workflow for my creative process when revamping illustrations and logos.	O
And at the end of my project I'm going to make make it a PDF, downloadable PDF and free to anybody.	O
I'm going to make a post on.	CHITCHAT
Be hands about this about this workflow.	O
An creative process in anybody who checks out my be hands.	O
Post can download the PDF and use it for their own creative exploration.	O
An even business.	O
That's my pitch.	O
Bone.	CHITCHAT
I don't remember like perfect.	CHITCHAT
Here's $1,000,000 man, you know this given out up to 5000 they say.	O
But in any case that could be something that's for anybody who produces anything creative.	O
Just write out your creative process.	O
What is your creative process?	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Put it into drawings.	O
Put it into a infographic.	O
Put it in a PDF.	O
I've made a PDF and children's book PDF.	O
In illustrator I did not even use Indesign 'cause I really don't like in design, but.	O

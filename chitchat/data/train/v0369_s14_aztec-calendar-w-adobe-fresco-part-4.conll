You know 'cause Art is in the eye of the beholder, just like beauty.	O
So somebody says this is art, Millard cool, that's art.	O
Whether it's art that I will want to own or or like or want is not the issue.	O
Not the not the point.	CHITCHAT
The point is that everybody has a right to create art and call it art.	O
Uh, and I never went to art school, so you know, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I've heard the horror stories of artists putting their heart and soul into art pieces.	O
And then?	CHITCHAT
The instructor, teacher, professor, whatever us shutting them down because.	O
Are there because the professor has their own?	O
Definitions of art and whatever.	O

Call it art.	CHITCHAT

In a single image.	O
And I want to be able.	O
To tell the story in several images or in a project or some kind of way that shows the potential to my skills and having me working on a particular project.	O

Have the talent.	O
To to take it way out there.	O
Very few artists have the skills.	O
And, uh, and so I made it my mission that I would be one of those artists that does have the skills that does have the talent to show off, not just the drawing, but a series of drawings or a project that can attract.	O
High level client tells clients.	O
And so, and that's what I did.	O

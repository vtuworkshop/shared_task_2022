I paid a lot of attention to Crystal Ann and listening to Christo, I realized that you know I have a lot of.	O
A lot of that are salesmanship.	O
Our confidence I grew up with a mother who.	O
Who saw Avon and Tupper Ware in a ton of products?	O
All our lives we grew up or an but we always had.	CHITCHAT
We always have money 2 for the bills you know we were never homeless.	O
Hungry lots of times for the homeless, no.	O
And so and so.	CHITCHAT
With all those memories of listening to my mother, um, sell Avon in Tupper Ware and do those tupperwares parties came back to me when I start thinking about marker ear.	O
In how to talk to people.	O
About when I charge Anthony Cordova houses what you were in a sound that's great.	O
Next time you were here, let me know we can grab some grub and discuss yes after the pandemic.	O
Of course, yes, of course.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I still know people there a mum and I love going to places where I know there are artists.	O
So definitely I will let you know we never made it to the beach.	O
It actually rained.	O
Almost every day that we were there.	O
A man got caught into a lot of traffic.	O
But found a lot of cool spots to eat and hang out.	O
And that's why we went.	O
We, my wife and I like going to places that are not necessarily uhm.	CHITCHAT
Vacation destinations We want to see something different.	CHITCHAT
Um so so get back to meet storytelling.	CHITCHAT
Uhm so yeah.	CHITCHAT
So, so as I looked hard at my work, I make sure I developed a lot of projects.	O
That and when I say projects, I mean things that turn into products.	O
You know a drawing could be a product.	O
Depending on how you use that drawing, how you format that drawing.	O
If you format that drawing for web and print, you end up with an illustration that can be used for merchandise.	O
Uhm, but if you just have a plane drawing.	O
And don't think beyond just the actual drawing.	O
Uhm, then it's going to be tough for someone to recognize your talent into something that they can use.	O
For their business, and when somebody can use that your art for their business, and that's when you'll have a client.	O
Uh-huh before if you have people who want to work but don't want to pay for it, that's not a client.	O
So, uh, Anthony says some of work is hanging on permanent display at the George R Brown Convention Center.	O
OK, OK, cool, cool some of work now who's work are we talking?	CHITCHAT
Is your work?	CHITCHAT
Uh or some artwork.	CHITCHAT
And then Mohammed has seen what's up.	CHITCHAT
He says very nice thank you, thank you, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Moby says, wow, I started selling for photography company in a moment.	O
I was 18I quit and went to college and I found out the company went out of business.	O
Now the photography company went out of business.	O
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
There's lots of reasons for those things to happen.	O
But at the end of the day, when you have a business, you have a business because you have customers and, uh, in so.	O
When art is your business, you need to find ways to show your customers that you aren't.	O
Is his value.	O
And in that stuff.	CHITCHAT
And that's not because companies, organizations, even individuals.	O
They feel that because you like to draw or create or take pictures or do graphic design.	O
Since you already like to do that, then why should you get paid to do to do it for them?	O
That you already you already have the computer open.	O
You already have a pencil in your hand.	O
Use that hand in that pencil and draw my logo.	O
Well, I know that's not how that goes.	CHITCHAT
I had to charge it for that, but why you already, you're not doing nothing right now like this drama logo where you watching TV?	O
And that's not how that works.	O
Yup, digital man killed analog photos.	O
Alright, let me yeah, I see that our comment, but I think I have to approve it because of the word killed.	CHITCHAT
You know, be hands has some guidelines and things.	CHITCHAT
Uhm yes, yes Uh, Yeah.	CHITCHAT

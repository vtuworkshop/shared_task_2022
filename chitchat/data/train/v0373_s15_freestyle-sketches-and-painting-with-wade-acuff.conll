Going to set it on fire.	O
She's running back and forth behind you, what, why, what I need to know.	O
When is that happening?	O
She chasing dog as if she is it's.	O
Perfectly OK.	CHITCHAT
It's just a slight adjustment on this, I don't know.	O
So I might keep it, might keep it.	CHITCHAT
You can see some of the things I've saved in the past with presets.	O
So a lot of times I'll just start instead of making a copy, I don't forget to make a copy.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like so I work non destructive by making a copy and then working on the copy.	O
And then I will say I will say that out and pair it down.	O
You know, to like one or two layers 'cause I like to use just one layer to paint on.	O
I used to have thousands of layers and it was.	O
It's like why am I doing this to myself?	CHITCHAT
You can paint the thing again over if you want to.	CHITCHAT
Now, obviously if it's something.	CHITCHAT
You know, if I want to add glasses or do something to this that I'm like, I'll probably not.	O
You know, I like to have both options.	CHITCHAT
I'll not.	CHITCHAT
I'll make a new layer called glasses and use that.	O
But if I forget to do this sometimes I will work on the layer and just start going in and I'm going to spend like.	O
You know 5 minutes and curves or something.	O
Or you know whatever would be like man, I really found something I like.	CHITCHAT
And then forget that I didn't made a layer that I should have made a layer, you know.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
So then I will attempt to see.	CHITCHAT
Then I will just like, Oh no, I didn't make a layer.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to delete asset cancel all this, make a new layer, then do my layers.	O
No, you don't have to do any of that.	CHITCHAT
All you have to do is go into your options.	CHITCHAT
Oops, wrong thing, sorry.	CHITCHAT
Go into your settings.	O
They've preset.	O
Name it, you know.	CHITCHAT
Orange head kid Then you have it and so then you can cancel out if you want, do whatever you want to do, but when you come back to it, you can just go.	CHITCHAT
I want to change this to the thing I had in its back.	CHITCHAT
But the good thing is, if you do, if you if you know you have multiple images that you're kind of stylizing or it's more for, it can be for anything, but I've seen it used mostly for photography.	O
If you have a lot of things you want to do that to, you can.	CHITCHAT
Actually.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you could still set the set that up in a droplet or any way you could just do a batch with this preset on.	O
And you're already done.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't use that a whole lot for stuff I do.	CHITCHAT
Filling at the orders.	O
Oh man, don't.	CHITCHAT
Tell me that.	CHITCHAT
So one thing I yeah, I don't know when.	CHITCHAT
I'm still doing the Gen con thing next month, but I am very much like my whole thing is I I don't.	CHITCHAT
We talked about this.	CHITCHAT
I don't really do the my.	CHITCHAT
I'm not set up to ship out orders.	CHITCHAT
I've never done it.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll do it for one offs in commissions and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
But I that's why I go to the shows so I can hand off the work and I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't the amount of commissions I get.	CHITCHAT
I don't mind doing that shipping.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's gonna be really interesting.	CHITCHAT
I got I don't have long to figure it all out.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I'm also not too concerned about.	CHITCHAT
How many people are actually using?	CHITCHAT

Yeah, she's still still scared up top.	CHITCHAT
I'll mess around with it.	O
I'm not too worried about it.	CHITCHAT
Man, but there's a year.	CHITCHAT
Man this year is gonna be flaming hot.	CHITCHAT
Uh, we might lose.	CHITCHAT
We might hit all this wrong back that up.	O
His back into our orange.	O
We need blasting all of this stuff really.	CHITCHAT
I mean it's gone from like a rim light to more of A.	O
And it's still semi rim fish.	O
Again, we're playing around with this, so we're trying to make this.	CHITCHAT
Trying to make this work.	CHITCHAT
Didn't all up in the.	CHITCHAT
Translucence E on this	O
Subsurface scattering all of that stuff.	O
I'm gonna watch it Crown.	O
When Mostaza Hotere, this is what he's talking about.	CHITCHAT
I've got a hot here.	CHITCHAT
So when you do that, when you would do this, it would basically be wherever the membrane is thickest.	O
You would have less white.	O
And where it is finished, you would have the most.	CHITCHAT
So you gonna just, you know, with a fantasy here you know you kind of base it off your own here, I guess.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Figure out what works.	CHITCHAT
At least that's what they told me in drawing fantasy ears class that I took.	O
I'm gonna go ahead and since were messing around with it, I'm gonna go ahead and make all the lighting correct as I configure it.	O
So you catch a lot of this stuff too.	CHITCHAT
OK, what did you?	CHITCHAT
What did you get in that class?	CHITCHAT
Drawing fantasy years class?	CHITCHAT
Thank you aced it.	CHITCHAT
From what I remember you telling me.	CHITCHAT
Exactly wrong, but I'm still them wrong seldom.	CHITCHAT
I give up on words, they fail me.	CHITCHAT
They fail me tonight.	CHITCHAT
That's OK, that's OK, um.	CHITCHAT
Musil smudge too little bit love it here little bit there.	O
I don't know we might mess around some more lighting, figure it, figure out some other things.	O
So I wonder if this looks like with this background.	O
Douge Well, it's crazy.	CHITCHAT
It's crazy, it's crazy.	CHITCHAT
I don't remember moving the character.	O
I guess I noted it down at some point.	O
Drawing fantasy years class.	O
We were so I was talking about the principles of drawing the fantasy year.	CHITCHAT
Just making up stuff dude.	CHITCHAT
All right, uh, this is time.	CHITCHAT
This is the time of the stream, where I say goodnight and ask you guys to go follow me on Twitter if you want to know when I go live.	CHITCHAT

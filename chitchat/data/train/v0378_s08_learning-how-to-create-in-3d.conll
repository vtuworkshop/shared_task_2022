No.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I really like giving extra cheekbones to these.	O
Or faces of whatever really like the high cheekbones, I guess.	O
Up Mother high cheekbones Queen.	CHITCHAT
Clean, Marjorie Up Some of that.	O
Ography It's.	O
Really higher, we didn't realize how.	CHITCHAT
I guess high upper cheekbones are.	O
But it makes sense.	CHITCHAT
It all makes sense.	CHITCHAT
The nose is too small actually.	O
Tomatoes like it's not quite enough like there's, uh.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Why is it doing that?	CHITCHAT
Trying to dig in right?	CHITCHAT
Philosophically.	CHITCHAT
Oh God, I am ruining.	CHITCHAT
No.	O
I can figure it out.	CHITCHAT
We're going to use our trim dynamic and that should be good for this.	O
'cause we just need to flatten this.	O
And then we can.	CHITCHAT
This is our flapping.	CHITCHAT
Flatten.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Mine.	CHITCHAT
With me With me home skillet.	CHITCHAT
OK well.	CHITCHAT
It looks good from my friend guide.	CHITCHAT
Going forward you about it.	CHITCHAT
She died from too much prune juice.	CHITCHAT
Can you add steers for eyeballs gassing can uhm.	CHITCHAT
I'm still kind of a baby with this program, so I'm actually before I do another stream of this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to figure out how to do that, 'cause I had another model that I worked on that was actually in like skin stuff.	O
So I wanted to.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to actually make like a want to try making a legit model.	CHITCHAT
It is that'll work.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, but you know minute try.	CHITCHAT
Oh, but I think it's really, really fine.	CHITCHAT
'cause I've seen some people make some really.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful models and I know I'm also kind of.	CHITCHAT
Burning and I, I, uh, about mostly done too D.	CHITCHAT
It's been really fun for me so I'm hoping I can.	CHITCHAT
I can make something.	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
The only angle that looks good on this models from the front I remember had the issue will ask.	O
So with that.	CHITCHAT
But It's kind of like I.	CHITCHAT
I like thinking of it is just like you're just doing multiple paintings, but it's like an on one thing you know.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
You can make it all cohesive, it just might not look cookies in if you don't know how to shoot the program.	CHITCHAT
Just checking the time because.	CHITCHAT
We are running out of it.	CHITCHAT
Wanna try going for 15 more minutes?	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping I have that much time.	CHITCHAT
That's all I want.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's fix the side how 'bout that.	O
Let's take time in fixing this.	CHITCHAT
Is a little rough.	CHITCHAT
A little rough and.	CHITCHAT
Lion Cemetery right now.	CHITCHAT
I believe you.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
The little guy looks a little rough.	O

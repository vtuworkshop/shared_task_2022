I'm almost done with my line art on this comic, which is nice.	O
Uh, many go back and so this is the opening of the comic I've got my 2 characters.	O
They're starting their day with a Cup of kindness.	O
And then these are the kind of the good deeds that they're going through.	O
We're starting with cleaning up the environment in there, helping this granny bear cross the road, coconuts carrying her groceries.	O
Then they're doing donations and then this will be the final one where they kind of reflect on how good it makes them feel to help out others.	O
So what I'm doing right now is just finishing up these this last kind of donation panel, and then I'll be on this one and then I'll be on colors, so hopefully that will go pretty quickly to color and this one won't be too bad.	O
These characters are Browns, there are very few colors.	O
I think the most colors is with coconut.	O
She's got a white body and orange cap, and then she's got the stripes on her tail.	O
Momo is really just about three colors.	O
Line art, her body color, which is kind of like a caramel Brown.	O
Busy day busy is good, busy is definitely good.	O
Getting stuff done.	O
So on the colour should go pretty equally on this one.	O
I got my my groups here set up and I'm just getting ready to open it right here.	O
It's gonna be the back of her head.	O
Groups yourself makes it easier for me to there we go.	O
Portfolio refreshed nice.	O
And since I have her group like this, I can move her around.	O
And kind of small.	O
Kind of play around with the characters in the frame a little bit.	O
Maybe I can just put them.	CHITCHAT
Now these are right there for you.	O
Get her body and her tail and she's holding onto that box of food.	O
And I kinda want her.	CHITCHAT
What?	CHITCHAT
And she said, how bad is bad?	O
I need her foot like she's kind of.	O
He said she said too much booty.	O
Alright, we gotta turn the booty a little bit.	O
This team that we've just kind of.	O
Bring it down all the boards.	O
That's a little bit more reasonable.	O
And so she's that tiny.	O
This set of stripes.	O
Around her sale.	O
And opportunity.	CHITCHAT
Do you have a color palette saved in Swatch is for each character I.	O
I should, I don't, but I generally know about the same.	CHITCHAT
I have this same line color that I go to and from what I go through is let me just let me open up one of my previous comics and show.	O
Adventure that's a good one.	O
Alright, so here is my one from Tuesday.	O
And so you can't really see it 'cause it's hidden behind.	O
This is my color palette that I work from an how I go through it is I kind of I start with my line art color, which is usually either Brown or dark blue and then I kind of go through here and pick different palettes and kind of just put together several different colors that I like and then I'll go through here and Mike.	O
Here is her orange an I'll pick that out.	O
And then I'll kind of follow a line down and build my pallets that way from the colours that I'll pick.	O
And once I settle on the colors that I want for the characters, I'll go in and I'll come.	O

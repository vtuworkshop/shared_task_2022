I usually have this set on Hue, saturation, balance an.	O
I'll go in and edit from there depending on the situation, but once I get those colors, I'll usually add them to.	O
The Swatch is so I don't lose them.	O
But sometimes it really depends because generally there are about the same.	O
She's kind of a caramel color and purple color in her body color always the same.	O
So and then she has this kind of offset Brown color, which is right here.	O
So it's not really.	CHITCHAT
I should do that and make it easier on myself, but I don't.	CHITCHAT
I like to kind of choose the colors for each illustration.	O
Yeah, I like that a lot.	CHITCHAT
I mean it.	CHITCHAT
I like having a neither of warm or cool tent to the line art depending on what is being depicted, uhm.	O
If I'm doing like nature scenes an like, the timing of the comic isn't like summer or, you know, kind of a warmer season of a client.	O
I'll pick those colors, but if I've got a like something in the winter, I'll pick the purple colors and just kind of work that in actually have let me show I can bring up one I know.	O
Just going to do it this way 'cause I can pick it easier and see it easier on the bigger screen.	O
Uh, back around Christmas time.	CHITCHAT
Why you so much faster now windows?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, exactly exactly.	CHITCHAT
And I just I kind of like to.	CHITCHAT
I feel like if I if I'm always picking on the same palette, I don't want him just like the lighting situation in this one.	O
I was really excited to work on that one.	O
An those colors I remember I was picking a little bit off of what was on here and I actually didn't end up adding those to my doc.	O
I should have but.	CHITCHAT
Where is.	CHITCHAT
Going to camp.	CHITCHAT
2 Atlas Brown.	O
I actually trend towards Brown locked.	O
Snow Angels I looked, I did that one in Brown because Pudges Brown.	O
At this one was blue.	O
Ignore.	CHITCHAT
So this one.	CHITCHAT
He was in wintertime snowy colors.	O
And I had.	CHITCHAT
I had my character interacting with the snowman, which is coming to life, but not when she looked at it so.	O
Kind of like.	CHITCHAT
I I get a lot of inspiration from Calvin and Hobbes, and I grew up reading those.	O
I grew up reading Garfield and far side and a lot of different ones like that so.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of where I get my joke inspiration from when I do a funny comic like that, but yeah, this is one and I kind of did the same thing.	CHITCHAT
You can see it over here.	CHITCHAT
Here's my line art color and then I kind of preceded down and built up my colors there.	O
I know that she's orange, so I needed some oranges, but mostly I was going to be dealing with kind of cooler Purples and Blues and she's got a warmer tint to her body color right here, which I did actually save.	O
And he looked up here.	CHITCHAT
You can see it's just a version of her.	CHITCHAT
Per cap color.	O
How long does it take to learn comic design?	CHITCHAT
I think a while an you learn a lot by doing.	CHITCHAT
I started.	CHITCHAT
I started trying to do comics around 2010 an I started and stopped a lot and that was because I didn't have the speed.	CHITCHAT
I didn't have the skills that I wanted an I couldn't get the stories out in the way that in the manner that I wanted, so I got frustrated.	CHITCHAT
I'd start and I'd stop and then I started doing daily paintings and that helped me advance my skills and also get quicker.	CHITCHAT
So I mean a lot of learning is in the doing, at least for me.	CHITCHAT
I also read a lot.	CHITCHAT

There are several really good books that let me just grab them right here that I relied on to help me learn the basics.	O
There by Scott McCloud hold on a second let me put my little bugs back in.	O
OK, here we go.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So I highly recommend both of these guys.	CHITCHAT
I read making comics first.	CHITCHAT
This is the nuts and bolts.	O
This is like the tools you use.	CHITCHAT
This is how to set up and understand panels how to.	CHITCHAT
I always have trouble describing this like bridging the gap between frames, that type of thing, and this is more understanding the iconography and you know what things mean in comics and how different comics are.	O
You know, place on a scale of visual versus words versus you know kind of abstract.	CHITCHAT
I mean they're both very good textbooks if you want to learn comics and take it, you know, pretty deep dive, he has another one which is reinventing comics and I think 1/4 one.	O
Oh yeah, no.	CHITCHAT
He's so good an I'm so glad I picked up those copies I had.	CHITCHAT
I had had them on PDF, and my iPad Anet through something.	CHITCHAT
It's just different when you can actually see it and read it, and you know I like to do a lot of bookmarks and you know, I like to highlight things.	CHITCHAT
I didn't highlight this because of course it you know.	CHITCHAT
Roominess, but that's another thing that it's organized, like a graphic novel, and you know, they say if you want to do it, you've got to immerse yourself in the art form.	CHITCHAT
And this is immersing yourself in the art for machine learning.	CHITCHAT
I've been trying to change my initial sketch color in digital drawing since I tend to use black and can't see on the original details, which kind of yeah, night, yeah that that's what I start in black-and-white just because it's easiest and then I I dropped my sketches down pretty low like these are all 30% or less and like what I did yesterday.	O
This is my initial sketch for this and it got to be such a mess and so I was, you know, taking out and pasting in different things.	O
You know to get to where I could actually see the design that I was drawing.	O
Again, an yeah, it can get really, really, really messy sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Right, yeah, like here's another messy one.	O
This was Tuesdays challenge stream was seen study from Jurassic Park.	O
And my sketch layer here was kind of messy, but the line art layer I had divided up into these are the foreground elements, middle ground background.	O
But I had everything drawn completely on each level.	O
Like here we go in here.	O
Let me go here this guy.	CHITCHAT
So if you look here, I've got.	CHITCHAT
He still drawn completely?	O
I didn't go in and race anybody because I was wondering if I would use this someplace else.	O
Is a stand alone.	O
So I wanted to keep these characters.	O
But yeah, all the lineart going all over each other was a mess.	O
How can I get those books?	CHITCHAT
They are available on.	CHITCHAT
Let me go ahead and grab the Amazon links here for you.	CHITCHAT
I sent a month retraining my knowledge of web coding, hit the wrong button on the hosting dashboard, went up with WordPress template compound.	CHITCHAT
Oh no.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you so much, Susan.	CHITCHAT
For now, rejected owed for foreigners in light room to store.	CHITCHAT
To pick so nice.	CHITCHAT
That's clever.	CHITCHAT
That when I redid My Portfolio I was I was stressing out alot about how to 'cause I had literally not touched it for years and I was kind of really stressing out about what to put in it and how to tell a story and how to kind of convey the work that I wanted to do and it just it's fun but kind of the starting is a little bit intimidating.	CHITCHAT

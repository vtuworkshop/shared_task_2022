I was almost certain that he had had a four point, I guess.	O
The actual first publication was the understanding comics that was in 90 four and this is the second book in the series which is like around 2006.	O
But this is you don't need to read them in order of publication.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I dove into the making comics first an I was absolutely fine.	CHITCHAT
Let me go ahead and grab that so I didn't want to tweet it.	O
I just know I didn't want to tweet it.	CHITCHAT
I just want nothing.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
How do you make it so difficult for me to share links?	CHITCHAT
Amazon.	CHITCHAT
I got it.	CHITCHAT
There's a book.	CHITCHAT
So frustrating is prepress jobs for 12 and rethink what I wanted to present.	CHITCHAT
Oh that's 12 years.	CHITCHAT
Oh wow.	CHITCHAT
So kind of like moving.	CHITCHAT
Moving industry is kinda.	CHITCHAT
Let me go over here.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to Basel.	CHITCHAT
Those are a great one to start of- if you just kind of want to learn, you don't know what to do.	CHITCHAT
Fantastic resources, there's also a lot of great resources on YouTube.	O
And you know a lot of things.	CHITCHAT
You know, general art.	CHITCHAT
Tutorials and you know, studying all the fundamentals all work into comics, like when you're drawing is senior.	CHITCHAT
Working with composition, all of those areas if you concentrate on one or the other, they will help your comic design and like perspective.	CHITCHAT
If you're drawing a lot of scenes and cities or rooms, you really need to press on that.	CHITCHAT
You know perspective, practice and learn how to draw things in a room so it's believable because when people are reading your comics they have you have like seconds.	CHITCHAT
If that milliseconds to communicate locations, an moods an you know.	CHITCHAT
Details that weren't will inform the joke you're trying to make.	CHITCHAT
If you're making funny comics so you know the fundamentals, it really you know.	CHITCHAT
If I could suggest anything I would do that as well as also studying story Anne, how to there are a lot of great books on story craft.	O
I have quite a few over here too.	O
Let me grab one.	O
This one this is actually based on save the cat rights and novel.	O
This is an offshoot of the original save the cats book which was for script writing in screen writing, but this applies all of these concepts apply to, especially if you're writing the long form comics.	O
You need to have a story.	O
It's understandable that goes some place, and so I've been studying and reading these.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause If you're making comics, you've got to have those two married together.	O
Well story and art.	O
I made templates for boxes anninos who printed on didn't get to do much in the design.	O
However, I cleaned up every once in FO no.	O
Oh, how frustrating.	CHITCHAT
And that reminds me of I worked in print design a little bit, and sometimes you know we get.	CHITCHAT
This is just a small, you know, small business printer is a large format.	O
They did like Rapson.	O
Christmas cards that type of stuff in a small product design an oftentimes we would get, you know, a client that would insist that they had vector files that they had high resolution photos and you know so many times.	O
I would open up the vector file an there would just be a JPEG that had been dropped into the vector file.	O

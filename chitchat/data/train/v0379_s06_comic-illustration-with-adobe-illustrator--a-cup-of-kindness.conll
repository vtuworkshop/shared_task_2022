Like if I'm doing the camera angle like from above or something, I don't usually do I like to kind of focus that focus on that.	O
For Tuesdays.	CHITCHAT
I've done a couple of seen studies for the last two of 'em.	CHITCHAT
Which were a lot of fun, so this next Tuesday will probably be something different than that.	CHITCHAT
I also do product design.	CHITCHAT
I did some sticker designs on a stream once.	CHITCHAT
So, but every Thursday is more comics, so if you're interested in comics stuff, definitely check out the Thursday streams, because that's when I put these together for my posts on Friday.	CHITCHAT
OK, I can.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I think.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm at the stage where I can cut that out and.	CHITCHAT
Brightness over here.	O
Move it over Young.	O
So I don't need that anymore.	O
I also can take coconut some.	O
Estimated.	CHITCHAT
It's out there.	CHITCHAT
Since I am pretty confident this is where moment she's going to be in the go ahead and just.	CHITCHAT
There is this.	CHITCHAT
What?	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
You welcome to Faizal.	CHITCHAT
I hope you have a great rest of your Thursday.	CHITCHAT
Here is the week on that's what I wanna know.	CHITCHAT
It was Monday, just.	CHITCHAT
A couple of days ago.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we've got through donation center.	CHITCHAT
We've got you guys are girls.	CHITCHAT
You're taking your canned foods.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to let see.	CHITCHAT
Kind of normal too.	CHITCHAT
A little bit more.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do is.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to come back here and I'm going to swoop in over here and I'm going to select some of this because I'm going to make that a different language.	O
I wanna put that and make sure it's all happy and ready to be colored a different color.	O
And then these guys would be regular.	O
Just wanna put that maybe on Earth.	O
Maybe one step, just push it back a little bit.	O
Sorry, that was done.	CHITCHAT
Let's hit save.	O
This my first time watching really like it when we use the blob brush.	O
How's it different mental regular brush?	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
The blob brush.	O
The big difference between that and the paintbrush.	O
The blob brush you got here, let me make this bigger.	O
Let's make it a lot bigger.	O
Apparently I was operating in like 1 point.	O
Who settings?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
All right, so the big difference is the blob brush creates Phil.	O
So this is not a stroke, it was, it is.	O
It's a Phil though.	O
So like when you're looking at this is this creates a stroke that you can then apply any different style too.	O
You can do a lot of different things with it.	O
You can edit the you can edit the width of it using the with editing tool.	O
Where are you?	CHITCHAT
We are over here, I think.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
He's always get pushed around.	CHITCHAT
I'm always losing certain tools.	CHITCHAT
It gets under this one.	O
Has a race right now.	O
Mr blunders here.	O
What's the life paint tool?	O
Oh Gosh.	CHITCHAT
To do that, it's control shift.	O
I think a key.	CHITCHAT
Nope, Nope.	CHITCHAT

Nope.	CHITCHAT
There we go to get rid of that.	CHITCHAT
Um, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Here is that down.	O
With tool here we go.	O
It's hidden under my thumb, so using this you can.	O
He kind of fake what's going on here, but the main difference is this creates a fill.	O
This creates a stroke and I like this for.	O
Just for sketching, it feels more natural to me.	O
And it, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I do it generally for outlines an my line art, but I also do, uhm.	O
Here, and he actually just come into here and show this is a final, so I'll use the blob brush to create this line art.	O
Also sometimes use it to help with the coloring.	O
So for example, these little lips, these little areas in the ears that's so small I might just come in with the blob brush inches, draw a little switch right there and for the shadowing there.	O
Otherwise I'll come in with the pencil tool and raw fills like I did with the.	O
With the coloring in the major areas back here, I'll just fill it in with the pencil tool an I'll follow around my line art.	O
And then do it that way.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, maybe the difference is an, you know there are a lot of I've seen some comic artists that use the.	O
Use the brush tool and then they'll apply a really cool brush to it.	O
That's like reminiscent of a paintbrush, or just has that kind of rough edge of oven acrylic brush, or like a pentel brush pen.	O
But for my my style I like the Clean Softlines 'cause all my characters are kind of soft and squishy.	O
So I want the lines to reflect that as well.	O
And it it's just it's kind of a matter.	O
I think of preference in the tool that you're used to.	O
I feel that for myself this is closer.	O
This bridges the gap of me drawing on paper with a pencil and a brush a little bit easier than the than the regular brush tool.	O
An again I don't use.	O
I don't apply a lot of the brushes and use that unless for very specific purpose.	O
Like if I'm distressing in area or.	O
I'm applying a texture all come in.	O
I'll use the brush.	O
All users watch Phil.	O
But this, if you have a tablet and you're able to do pressure sensitivity stuff, I definitely would suggest giving it a try, because it it really changed the way I worked and how fast I was when I adopted using the bloggers tool I tried to use the web tool and I still require more practice, yet no, it's a It's a tricky one.	O
If you're looking at, let's actually let's make the.	O
Something we can see here.	O
Let's just make this ridiculous.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
One of the big things that really tweaked me when I was initially using it was, you know, editing this and dragging it along here, because if there were a lot of points in the, you know the line was rough.	O
It kind of it got a little wonky and you know of course adding multiple points along the along the stroke in editing it.	O
That way it does take a lot, but it was an indispensable tool for me when I was working with just keyboard and mouse.	O
Because I wanted that line variation, I didn't want to have just single with lines.	O
I wanted to have the ability to control that.	O
And so yeah, it was, you know.	CHITCHAT
Trial by fire, I guess.	CHITCHAT
Figuring out how to do all that good stuff, but it's a great tool to have and I remember the version.	O
I think it was CS5 or CS 5.5 that they came out with that because I've I was on 2 for the longest time and I don't believe it had the width tool and the switch to five.	O
Brought that, and I think that brought the pattern tool to an.	O
I was so excited about those features.	O
'cause that was something I really wanted to incorporate.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I hope that answers your question.	CHITCHAT

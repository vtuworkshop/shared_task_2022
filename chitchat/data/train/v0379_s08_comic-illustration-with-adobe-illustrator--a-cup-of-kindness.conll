Can if you have anymore like you know, if you have specific things regarding the blob Russian, how I how I work or anything else, just go ahead and Drop it in chat and I will do my best to help.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Don't set the scene before I do this 'cause she's gonna be there.	O
Kinda do in her little for little flicks.	O
Up We'll just start with less.	O
Oh, I hope you like it, Kim.	CHITCHAT
It really is a fun too.	CHITCHAT
I mean it, it takes, uh oh, here, let me actually let me let me qualify this here a little bit.	O
These are my settings for the blob brush up I have keep selected unchecked an I have merge only with selection checked and what that allows me to do is in the type of drawing I do like I'm often creating a lot of textures grass is.	O
Things that require me to do a lot of strokes in quick succession.	O
An if I had both of these checks to I would be creating a gigantic single shape that is Uneditable.	O
So I would suggest keeping a no uncheck that, so at least until you get the hang of the tool and how you're going to work with it and how you want to use it.	O
I would keep that unchecked so your strokes are our individual.	O
Unless of course you don't want them to be, in which case this merge only with selection is your bro.	O
He that one let's you select what you want to edit and then whatever stroke you add will be merged with that automatically.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I also do.	CHITCHAT
Here I go on the setting.	O
I keep it kind of in the middle.	O
I compare this a lot to the lazy Mizumi Plugin and photo shop.	O
This gives you mines a little bit of smoothing or a lot of smoothing, but play around with those settings and see how much a little or a lot that you like and 'cause I can really kind of.	O
It's a little bit of hand studying, you know if you're.	O
The IT is kind of for me.	O
It's pretty critical that I have that.	O
'cause it just, you know, it just helps, especially if you know you're working on tablet, your hands sweaty.	O
You know you're not exactly getting the perfect line.	O
That will help you get it.	O
And then play around with these settings as well.	O
Make sure you have this set to pressure and that will give you the nice stroke with variation when you press on your tablet and play around with these settings, you can do a lot of fun things with these two guys.	O
You can effectively turn this into a calligraphy pen if you want to try your hand at lettering and do all sorts of neat stuff just by editing that, making it like a chisel tip for.	O
You know what have you?	CHITCHAT
So there are, you know, within that one dialog box there a lot of fun things that you can do.	O
But yeah, it's it's a pretty indispensable tool for me.	O
And you know, I can kind of.	CHITCHAT
I got my tablet around 2016.	CHITCHAT
And in my first few drawings, I can see that I was still trying to draw, oh.	CHITCHAT
I am getting a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
Have no comeback.	CHITCHAT
Come on.	CHITCHAT
Oh, don't die any.	CHITCHAT
Come on, come back.	CHITCHAT
Oh is it coming back?	CHITCHAT
Or we can.	CHITCHAT
Over back, yeah I'm back.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you should be able to.	CHITCHAT
I just had a, um, a bunch of big lag spike in OBS.	CHITCHAT
It looks like I'm back though.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, II.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully maybe.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it looks like I'm back.	CHITCHAT
We're going to press on.	CHITCHAT
If you're seeing if a little live icon at the bottom of your screen is not ready, you can go ahead and refresh and you'll get the live feed, but I should be back.	CHITCHAT

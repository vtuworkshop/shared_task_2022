There is a little bit of lag.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully.	CHITCHAT
That Is all fixed up.	CHITCHAT
I lost my train of thought.	CHITCHAT
20 I was talking about how I personally started using the block Brush.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I got my my tablet 2016 and those first few drawings I did on it.	CHITCHAT
I was still trying to draw.	CHITCHAT
How I drew with keyboard mouse using the tablet.	CHITCHAT
So it was a really kind of a.	CHITCHAT
It was a transition that took a little bit, and so definitely just give you time to get used to the you know, the different tools and.	CHITCHAT
'cause it'll change the way you do stuff.	CHITCHAT
And I personally got a lot faster and.	CHITCHAT
And I feel like I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Closer to drawing in traditional media which.	CHITCHAT
Which I think really helps me.	CHITCHAT
Get excited about.	CHITCHAT
Drawing in digital, even more so than I had already been doing.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's do this Coco Flex key flexing.	O
She's doing her best, she's.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Oh, also, if you're doing a lot of blob brush work, I would come.	O
I would suggest.	O
Doing a lot of grouping.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Because you can lose like what I'm doing right here is, I have all my characters group.	O
I have generally all of My 93.	O
I have generally all of my objects grouped.	O
If you're drawing with a blob brush, you can get.	O
You can lose a lot of lines you can lose.	O
It's very easy if you don't have a system of our layers or grouping too.	O
Is there a lot of them are?	O
I'm trying to explain it.	CHITCHAT
Like when I first started out, I would be drawing, you know, doing something and I would lose like Phil or a stroke and it would be really standing out like I change the line color of everything except that one piece.	O
But because it was buried so far behind other things I couldn't select it.	O
So the way I answered that problem was to be really vigilant about grouping things.	O
So if I'm working on a character I will put down one or two strokes.	O
And then I will group those two strokes and then I will only be operating within that group as far as his character it.	O
Yes, exactly label as you go.	O
Just make a habit of being.	O
Being organized and it'll save you a lot of frustrations, Ann.	O
'cause I did I did that so many times and.	CHITCHAT
And will probably if you watch, you know, a lot of my streams, or if you hear me admonishing myself for not drawing in my group, that's why and.	CHITCHAT
And it's something that you always have to remind yourself to do, even if it's habit that are sometimes slip out of it.	CHITCHAT
And it will also help you too if your drawing you know really layered drawings.	O
If you're if you've got a lot of characters you're working with.	O

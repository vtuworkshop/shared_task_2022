Tip her head up a little bit screwed that an going here.	O
Yeah, little bit bigger as she is a full grown cat or coconut leaves and I'll have to probably make her reflection smaller.	O
Um, do reflections is a little tricky.	O
Kids.	CHITCHAT
She's got this back and right here she's holding on to the mirror.	O
Yeah, you know, not all of this year is going to be oh gosh, that beer is way too big.	CHITCHAT
My son is take your ear down at some levels normal.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
She's proud of her girl.	O
She's happy.	O
Lips.	O
23 And since it's going to be behind the mirror, I don't need that her other PA is course behind the mirror.	O
I'm going to add her tail in here because I don't know how I'm going to movies.	O
My pieces around yet.	O
I might come.	CHITCHAT
I might bring these two a little bit closer, maybe make them a little bit smaller, but they're going to occupy that general space there, and so let's see.	O
I don't need her face line and let's clean up some of these.	O
And then I'm gonna add this in here.	O
And I'll go through.	CHITCHAT
Probably when I'm in the coloring stage.	O
And Allah race.	CHITCHAT
You know, the bits of the lines that I don't need, but for now I like to keep everything as much as possible.	O
So I'll erase a good amount of you know her since I haven't group too.	O
It'll be easier so I just you know what?	O
Why don't I just do it now?	CHITCHAT
And erase this.	O
I know that's where I wanted to be so I don't really see that I'll be changing her position a lot.	O
And then her paw is in front.	O
So I'm going to select this and always nice.	O
I don't always do this.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I like to leave everything intact again if I wanna raise things moving around, but I'm pretty confident that's where I want her to be.	O
So I'm gonna move this forward.	O
Just a snitch.	O
And then I'm gonna come over here and take out my little guidance sketch.	O
Looking over there.	O
Come back here and hit save.	O
Say that you haven't yet.	CHITCHAT
Mostly out of Snitch.	O
And I might rearrange her tail.	O
And here I think I need to make cocoa.	O
Let's jump out a little and you just select her and I'm going to drop her down a little bit.	O
And that's a little better.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
That looks like she's looking at herself in the mirror.	O
And I thought this here.	O
Wanna have it centered on this?	O
'cause I have a pending.	O
And the final.	O

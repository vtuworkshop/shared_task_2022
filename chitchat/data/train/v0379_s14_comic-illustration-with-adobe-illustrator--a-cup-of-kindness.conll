Before I say my liner is done is always this.	CHITCHAT
How to add?	CHITCHAT
Website.	O
Right, so when was little.	CHITCHAT
But I wanted to do it here.	CHITCHAT
I don't like that they're floating kind of in space, so I'm just going to.	O
I'm gonna give him a little bit of something underneath.	O
Actually, and this is an example of me using the blood rushes to draw it out a little bit.	O
From Let's do something over sure.	CHITCHAT
All right now, they're not floating in the middle of nowhere.	O
And it still kittens.	O
She needs to be small alright.	O
So starting today with a Cup of kindness and then I go through and these are the kindness is there doing.	O
With an Asian Center, the difference between is inside you.	O
I like that a lot.	CHITCHAT
And this whole comic was inspired by.	O
This little lettering thing I did yesterday as I come.	O
When I was.	O
Initially putting the idea together, I started sketching out that comic and so kind of went one.	O
In the other hand in hand so.	O
I will be doing a snitch a smidge.	O
Of editing, probably on um, just some general sizing and placement.	O
I do like this how it is I might.	CHITCHAT
I make so I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I might draw a little extra here just to fill that up a little bit, but I in general I really like how this is laid out now instead of the three across it.	O
Kind of feels more full and so my next steps I won't be getting to those on stream today, but my next step is coloring and I started all pretty much the same way.	O
I stroke everything with the line color with the exception of this one.	O
And I want to push that in the back a little bit.	O
So I separated this section out and actually let me go back here and I'm going to do it this way.	O
We're going to Desaturate.	CHITCHAT
We're going to desaturate this color.	O
An late, never little bit.	O
And that will give up.	CHITCHAT
See how it looks a little bit further away now.	O
And it's just that subtle change in line color, and that that kind of helps me to to remember that you know when I'm coloring this section, my colors are going to be a little bit less saturated.	O
'cause this is further away and I need to convey that in the colour as well as the Wiener.	O
So, uhm.	CHITCHAT
And for some reason, food donation center is all wonky.	O
Did you make that bigger?	O
Let's see, let's bring food down.	O
123 big There we go.	O
So that's another thing.	O
If there are background elements.	O
If there are sound effects are generally do that.	O
In my own handwriting, and then the comic text itself will be.	O
Will be regular text late in life that also this.	O
I don't want it to be as big as my colleague.	O
It's funky's up to.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And I'm like, yeah, so that's it for me today.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for joining me.	CHITCHAT

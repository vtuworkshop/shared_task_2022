But if you start seeing me randomly post on Sunday, I'm testing out my schedule so.	CHITCHAT
I always do a lot of testing before I you know doing announcement on it just to make sure that I can keep that schedule and keep my commitment that I made.	CHITCHAT
So let me put up my ending screen on my left is the my Facebook, my Twitter and my Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I do dailies on Twitter and Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I kind of curate Facebook a little more so if you want some cute but don't want to see it all the time I would suggest looking at.	CHITCHAT
Facebook, but if you wanna see dailies, I post those on Twitter and Instagram.	CHITCHAT
So next time I'm live will be Tuesday and that will be with a challenge.	CHITCHAT
I need to figure out what it will be.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to do another scene study I might do and expressions challenge with some in notes or.	CHITCHAT
Oh I.	CHITCHAT
Rash, Mahan Uhm you know what here actually yeah let me let me just answer that real quick so my tools are I use for line art.	CHITCHAT
I used the blob brush.	O
Um, which is the Sky right here I do my sketching initially in the blob brush and then I do my line art and with it as well.	O
And then when I color let's see, let's go in here.	O
Give you an example.	O
I use the pencil tool right here, which is the other tool tips on.	O
You can see that right there.	O
I use this to create my fills for large areas so like if I'm coloring the character if I am.	O
Doing Siri, I'll use the pencil tool to fill in large sections there and then I'll come through with either the pencil tool again or the BLOB brush and I'll add, you know, values and shading and things like that.	O
Smaller areas like this all generally do with the blob rush just to kind of paint it in, but if larger areas, I'm delete.	O
This really isn't a good example.	CHITCHAT
This is a better example, so this is last two.	O
This is Tuesday's past Tuesday's comic.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So let's take this this one for example.	O
I there we go here is layer group rather where I colored everything so you'll see back here.	O
I have a big section I laid in a gradient that kind of created the dark Moody forest in the background.	O
And then I came over with I drew these shapes here with the pencil tool just to give it a little bit more depth to kind of to show that it's going, you know, kind of just fading out into the darkness there, but we have this right.	O
Pool of light out here and so kind of like a break in the trees and I wanted to push that light so I had to make this background pretty dark and.	O
Then I have the light that's, you know, kind of reflecting off the water.	O
We got.	CHITCHAT
This grass is here.	O
It's a little bit lighter, a little bit more saturated.	O
And then I have these areas of Dappled, Dappled Light where what light is filtering through this dense tree cover, and it's just hitting her.	O
If she's jumping into this little pool, and so the way I did this again was I went through and I've got my little selections of where I want shadows to be.	O
I'm thinking right here that OK, I need a shadow of.	O
This giant tree over here and I need a little bit of the shoreline and this is a big Hill that's kind of bumping out over the water so I need to reflect that in the water.	O
And then I would come in, for example, to do this lighting effect right here.	O
what I did was I took, I drew the general area of the kind of dapple light, and then I would come through and I would do highlights over here with the blob brush because it's a very thin line that I wanted.	O
And it would just be easier for me to just kind of go in there and draw it in.	O
So I kind of alternate when I'm coloring back and forth between those tools.	O
And if you want to see.	O
Right now.	CHITCHAT
They're all the outlines of everything.	O
You kind of see.	O
All the different scenes like that.	O
But that's kind of how I put together.	O
Each of my panels and drawings and the general tools that I use.	O
I use a lot of gradients.	O

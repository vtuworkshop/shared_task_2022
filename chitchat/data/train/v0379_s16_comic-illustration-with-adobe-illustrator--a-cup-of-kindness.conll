I use a lot of I use heavily the Hue Saturation, balanced panel for editing my colors and I'm always trying to think about, you know.	O
What my focus is when I'm drawing.	O
Uhm, you know, if I want this to be the focus, I kind of want a lot of my elements to subtly point to that focus and.	O
I'll do that, you know, just in different different ways.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let me see what else do I use.	O
But yeah, see this this stuff down here.	O
That's all.	CHITCHAT
Blah brush that's all detailing I put in on the ground with a blob brush tool.	O
If you're thinking about using it, I would just, you know, experiment a little bit.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Look at the.	CHITCHAT
Look at the settings right here and mess around with those a lot.	O
See what you like 'cause you can turn this pen tip into whatever you want.	O
You can make it a you know, like a slant tip, calligraphy pen like you're like.	O
Really neat lettering just by messing with these settings and making this roundness.	O
You can take it all the way down so it's just a tiny split and then you can do really need effects.	O
With that you can meet textures and stuff and grass is.	O
Let's play around with those settings.	O
If you're thinking about trying out the blob brush for drawing, it's you know if you're coming from doing a lot of graphic design and a lot of precision an using the pen tool, it can be a little grading because I mean, I did that a lot.	O
I was kind of stuck because I liked the precision of, you know, the fewest points, treats the most beautiful lines and curves, but this is a very messy style, but that's more of my drawing style, and that's something that you kind of have to discover for yourself.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And figure out for yourself.	CHITCHAT
But it's definitely a fun tool to use, and I think, at least for me personally, it bridges traditional.	O
Drawing with digital drawing a little better.	O
It's kind of closer to I imagine what you would be doing and photo shop for different brushes there.	O
I mean, besides, of course you know creating the texture and stuff, but you're doing liner.	O
I think a lot of people generally use that the soft round or whatever it is.	O
But yeah, so that's a little bit about my tools.	O
Uhm, hopefully that helps.	CHITCHAT
Rush Mahan if you have any other questions I am about to lagaf here so go back over this and zoom out.	O
There is the finished comic I will be actually go over that real quick too.	O
I don't need to make that.	CHITCHAT
I'll just go in here.	CHITCHAT
So here's an example of a finished comics for web layout for Twitter and website and read.	O
It would be a one pager that's kind of optimized for mobile viewing and scrolling.	O
Then this is how I optimize it for Instagram if I want to have a seamless.	O
Seamless some you know, swipe what I'll do is I'll create two art boards that are butted up against each other and then the separate ones of course are a lot easier to do, but that's how I come in.	O
Split it out for different the same content for different platforms.	O
Oh, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
He sticky sticky him about to end stream.	CHITCHAT
How you doing sticky?	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT

There we go, once again my socials over to the left I Post Daily on Instagram and Twitter.	CHITCHAT
We wanna catch those there.	CHITCHAT
One last question, which is your drawing tablet.	CHITCHAT
It is the Sintec 13 HD I believe they have a pro version of.	CHITCHAT
Uh, the 13, but I think that the current model is the walk home.	CHITCHAT
One is a 13 inch screen I believe, and then they have a pro 16.	CHITCHAT
As Pro 24 and a pro 32, and I thought there was a pro 13 but for some reason I don't see it a lot.	CHITCHAT
He is a Scott.	CHITCHAT
All right, uhm, yeah, so that's it for me today.	CHITCHAT

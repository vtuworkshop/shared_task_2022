Also, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
If we can.	CHITCHAT
OK, so is watching the replay from yesterday and it doesn't look like the comment stick around after the replay so will want to check out those links in the middle of the feed.	CHITCHAT
But alright, let's get going.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to do.	CHITCHAT
We're going to jump into Adobe fresco today.	O
We're going to have some fun.	CHITCHAT
Yesterday I was playing around with this Penguin painting that I did forever ago.	O
We were just trying to trace over it and do some oil painting stuff, which is fun.	O
Super cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put pause on that.	CHITCHAT
We had some great questions from yesterday's live about masking.	CHITCHAT
Watching this music is just out of control.	O
A little bit of music.	O
Happy amount of music.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, some questions about masking an what's really cool about masking.	O
If you don't know what masking is.	O
Basically you're hiding certain parts of an image in revealing other parts with a mask.	O
And the best way to just show you that and why you would even care just to dive into it.	O
So we're going to do is I'm going to for the sake of just blitzing right into this thing.	O
And in trying to show you what I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
Let's just do it.	CHITCHAT
So let's throw a bright color.	O
I don't know will work with Blues and stuff today, and I could just take the paint bucket tool and just tap on this new layer that I've gotten fillet.	O
Except for the brush stroke that I taped, so we're going to double tap two fingers to undo that.	O
Let's try it again.	CHITCHAT
Paint bucket, and now have the option to do a vector layer or pixel layer.	O
Your choice.	CHITCHAT
Right now I'm going to work with pixel layers, 'cause then I can do some destructive working as well.	O
All right, so we've got a layer filled and maybe what I want to do is add some more texture to that as well.	O
So let's jump into my color and let's just dark in this up just a tiny tiny tiny bit, not too much.	O
One staying the same value or tone, or Q or whatever you want to call it.	O
And let's jump into our watercolor brushes.	O
And that's what we've got going on here.	CHITCHAT
So we're in watercolor.	O
We've got a let's do a wash soft.	O
Brush Roulette spider could be cold too.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We're going to play around.	O
I love these watercolor brushes, so now I'm going to do is just scrub my brush size way the heck up.	O
'cause I'm just trying to do a quick wash and it'll go even faster.	O
You guys if you scrub your canvas size way down because then let's see.	O
Let's go to this camera angle look it's tiny and I can cover the whole canvas pretty quick, right?	O
So let's see how it looks on the.	CHITCHAT
This view tonight, OK?	CHITCHAT
Right, so you can just kind of quickly get a wash over the whole canvas.	O
We were just trying to get some texture going on.	O
OK, zoom up a little bit, play around with it.	O
I'm just trying to kind of get get something, get something going here, just trying to get a creative background texture.	O
Just something to work with OK and then we can.	CHITCHAT
Also I forget the name of this thing 'cause I just you know what too many things going on, but this little button down here in the bottom left.	O
If I tap and hold it with my finger now what it's going to do is actually pure water over the top like there's not going to be.	O
Any color is just going to kind of blend things and to be honest I'm not seeing a huge change right now with what I've got going on.	O
Let's keep working this in a little bit kind of burning the edges a little bit.	O
Just just having some fun with it, maybe even bringing some.	O
Some purple or something I don't know.	O
Alright, having fun today, right?	CHITCHAT
So we've got a layer in the background.	O
It's pretty, we like it.	CHITCHAT
It looks like a watercolor thing and I'm going to make a new layer.	O
OK, so now we're going to do is going to make a mask.	O
This is where it gets a little bit technical, but stay with me here so we're going to click on the little square with the Plus in it for a new layer.	O
Now that we've got a new layer, let's fill it.	O
I'm going to fill it with white so it looks like a canvas.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Change Dwight Gooden my paint bucket.	O
Going to tap right on there.	O
I'll fit with the pixel layer, that's fine.	O
Alright, so here's what we want to do.	O
These three little dots in the sidebar on the right I'm going to tap on that right below the eyeball.	O
By the layers and I'm going to come down to mask layer contents.	O
OK, I'm actually going to create an empty mask.	O
Instead, so now if I swipe on this layer.	O
Little nice and slow.	O
OK, so that is the white canvas.	O
And if I swipe back left or left to right, I don't know directions and stuff.	O
This is my mask, so we're going to be painting on the mask layer.	O
OK, we're above the purple and blue in watercolor thing and now one thing I want to point out.	O
OK, let's get.	CHITCHAT
Let's get a brush to work with here.	O
I don't even know what I'm working with.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what sketching brush.	O
We have gone pencil.	O
Now let's get something else.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to.	O
Marker might have for just going to do a simple marker brush and just kind of see what that does for us all right?	O

We got market brush.	O
I'm going to come down to OK so this is confusing for me 'cause I'm used to photo shop where it typically if you're working with a black color the black will hide whatever's below it in a mask and white will reveal what's underneath it.	O
OK, but in fresco you'll see down at the bottom in the center we've got reveal and hide so I can tap on these, but I want to reveal.	O
Or hide what I'm drawing with so it doesn't seem to matter if I'm painting with black or white.	O
I would have thought that you need to come over here and change my color.	O
To black to fully start revealing, but if I go to let's just pick something crazy like yellow, it seems to still work, and if I look at my mask layer it still painting in black because I've got the hide button set by change back to reveal and I drove over the top.	O
It's kind of like an eraser so nothing is changing on the actual white canvas.	O
It's only changing.	O
On the mask makes sense.	O
Alright, so let's double tap two fingers to step back.	O
Little bit little bit more right back on this layer.	O
I want to go back to what we did was reveal or hide.	O
Must've been hide OK so I'm going to tap on hide.	O
Got my marker brush selected.	O
On this layer and now I can draw or do some hand lettering or whatever I want to do.	O
Maybe do my signature logo thing?	O
And what's cool about it in this brush is not very fat to see, but you can see how it the texture of the watercolor layer below comes through and then on top of that, because it's a marker brush, it's also adding its own multiplier effects to the strokes, which is really cool.	O
So you see how the letters when they come over themselves.	O
It looks just like a marker, so we've got two effects going on.	O
We've got the watercolor down below and we've got the marker brush on top so you can achieve a lot of really cool effects with that.	O
Let's jump over to the background layer.	O
An I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to leave this top layer turned on.	O
I'm going to come over and let's grab.	O
Kind of a brighter blue, almost TLC foam color.	O
And let's jump back over to my watercolor brush.	O
Soft wash it's big and I'm just going to come down here and just kind of paint a little bit just to kind of add some color to the tail of that L so you can see how you could come back in after the fact and I'm painting again.	O
On you can see that I'm selected on this multi color layer below, so if I turn off the layer above it, I'll click on that and we will swipe over to be on the layer and then click on the eyeball to turn it off.	O
You can see that I'm just I'm just kind of drawing on.	O
You know watercolor on top of.	O
This layer, so I hope that makes sense.	O
Very cool stuff that whoops wrong layer.	O
Layers are important, pay attention.	O
So what I could do with that, let's see what can I do with that?	O
Can I turn this into a logo?	O
An illustrator or Photoshop.	O
Should have practiced guys.	CHITCHAT
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see how can I do?	CHITCHAT
What can I do with this?	O
Let's see if we can actually take this into illustrator and do something with it.	O
So I'm going off script.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't planning to do this, but this is super cool and I kind of want to use it.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to hit the share button on the very top of.	O
That's a little square with you guys used to the share button.	O
Alright publish an export.	O
Let's see what options we have.	O
I'm going to come over to export as.	O
With PNG, if I do a PNG, I wonder.	O
A kind of doubt, but I went, oh, I could do a PSD.	O
Let's see what that does for me, alright, and I'm going to save this as.	O
Let's see, you get some music going.	O
Maybe some different music going?	O
Alright DM.	O
Oh my gosh, you can just start screwing with music and then I get distracted.	CHITCHAT
Alright DM?	O
How do you guys name your files?	CHITCHAT
I'm all over the place to be honest, DM.	CHITCHAT
Watercolor.	O
And I thought watercolor was two words, but then earlier doing something to try to auto correct to one.	CHITCHAT
So whatever DM watercolor logo alright save it as a PSD.	O
Let's export it and see what we can do with this thing.	O
Alright, If I could send to my wife that be cool, uh, air droplets who I could hear Drop it I could save it the files.	CHITCHAT
I should be able to.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, I'm just going to air drop it.	O
'cause I'm close.	CHITCHAT
I could also save the files and pull up on a Mac, but we're going to drop it.	O
To my Mac.	O
Sitting right here and look at that.	CHITCHAT
It's already in the download stack.	O
Let's switch views here.	O
Alright, so I've got.	CHITCHAT
OK, my mouse Gramma Goodies Alright so we've got.	CHITCHAT

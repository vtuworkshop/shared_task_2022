This is super confusing 'cause I've got live screens on and in the way do it.	CHITCHAT
My wife says alright, let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Where Is Everybody?	CHITCHAT
I see a lot of you watching, but nobody's commenting, say hello, alright, let's jump into flexi So what it did when I shared that it threw it down in my download stack so I see it down here as DM watercolor logo.	O
So I'm just going to open an and see what in the world happens.	O
What's it going to do?	CHITCHAT
What's it going to do?	CHITCHAT
Alright, there it is.	CHITCHAT
That is so freaking cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I've got a mask.	O
Up here It's just like I made this inside of photo shop.	O
You guys know that means.	CHITCHAT
You can do so much starting in fresco.	O
With the pressure sensitive, I mean I know it's like having Asante girl welcome tablet like I get that, but still very cool.	O
So I've got this pixel there.	O
What happens is the smart object.	O
If I double click on it.	O
OK so we gotta composite.	O
I don't know, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright so it opened up a new composite PSD file will close that.	O
We've got a background.	O
We've got our mask on top.	O
Alright, so how can I let me think about this?	CHITCHAT
Alright, how can I turn this into a workable 'cause?	O
Here's the problem.	CHITCHAT
If I were to throw this on top of anything else, I really can't let me let me try to show you what I'm talking about.	O
Music is a little better.	O
Not much better, but we're getting there.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's just say I will just throw this image in there.	O
So small it's a small image where I delete that one.	O
Tough country is a cool image thing.	O
This is what happens when I go off script and I don't practice, I get.	CHITCHAT
Distracted, but that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so obviously the images back here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going through the top layer I forgot turn visualize so you can see the shortcuts I'm doing.	O
Alright, that will help out a little bit.	CHITCHAT
And then also turning on, let's go to photo shop, go to window, go to extensions, turn on the tool timeline so be hands can see it.	O
This could break things.	O
No, I don't want it.	CHITCHAT
OK, well, whatever, whatever I'm going to about it.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I've got the layer this photo up top but I want.	O
That's cool, hey, that mask still works over the top of a photo to so I can turn the photo off.	O
And now I'm asking different things.	CHITCHAT
And it looks like if I zoom in Nice and tight, it's a lot harder to see on this photo.	O
So see how the marker you've got that really nice really looks like a marker overlay, so them ask if we were to explore that closer and my brain is not there this morning, but there's a way I could see this mask bigger and.	O
It doesn't matter.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna get distracted.	CHITCHAT
Alright?	CHITCHAT
So basically it, the darker so pure Blackwood mass completely but like if it was a amid tone like a Gray tone is not going to mask through as much so that mask is more than just black or white.	O
It's actually got different shades of Gray in it.	O
So that's how that's working.	CHITCHAT
Which is cool.	CHITCHAT
But again, when I turn on this.	O
See it as much with that photo behind it all right.	O
So what we want to do, we're going to try.	CHITCHAT
We're going to try on the spot here to turn this into some kind of a logo or vector icons.	O
So I'm going to do is command and click on the mask.	O
OK, so I'm holding the command.	O
I'm clicking right on the mask layer and it turns it into a selection into these marching ants.	O
OK, so now that I've got the marching ants, there's a few different ways I can work.	O
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking, thinking, thinking the best way.	CHITCHAT
Would be let's go to window, go down to paths.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And so you know what I noticed too.	O
So it's actually selecting the inverse.	O
It's selecting everything else.	O
So I want to go to select down to inverse, so shift command I if you're doing shortcuts.	O
Click on that and now it's only selecting.	O
This stuff here.	CHITCHAT
So I could even make a new layer if I wanted to let me.	O
I've got all kinds of stuff going on here.	O
And I can't see the bottom.	O
There we go, I'm gonna click down here on add a new layer an I could grab my fill double clicking here don't grab any color doesn't matter.	O
And I could hit alt delete.	O
Or I could go up here to edit down to fill.	O
And it's going to fill that selection.	O
Changes drop down to foreground color, so what's in the front will click OK and now it looks pink.	O
Command D to deselect if I turn off everything down below it.	O
Now I just have one that's actually really cool.	O
I don't do that.	CHITCHAT
Check this out.	CHITCHAT
So we use the marker brush.	O

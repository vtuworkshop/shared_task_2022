I filled this with a solid pink however.	O
Oh, that's really cool.	CHITCHAT
It kept the transparent.	O
Tendencies of this, so I could.	CHITCHAT
That's actually really cool.	CHITCHAT
I could just take this one layer.	O
You can see it, but if I turn off the background layer until the transparency, the Checker boxes showing behind so it's actually transparent.	O
Alright, So what I'm going to do?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do a few different things.	O
If I lose track I want to export this as a PNG just like this as one option.	O
Well maybe change the color as another option and then I'm also going to try and export vectors as an option.	O
Alright, so we're going to do is jump into this layer one.	O
We're going to come up here to image.	O
Down to trim now.	O
By default there is no shortcut key for this.	O
So what I did is I went into.	CHITCHAT
That's another day that I went into photo shop down to know I went into edit down to keyboard shortcuts, found that menu item and I applied a shortcut.	O
So way out of the scope of what we're doing right now, but we're going to trim this image what it's going to do is bring up this trim box and I can say based on transparent pixels I want to trim away the top left, bottom and right, and so the reason why I set a shortcut for this is a lot of times I'm creating images for the Web or fixing logos just like this, so when I click this button it automatically crop sit tight around.	O
Any pixels to make sense?	O
Super cool now I'm going to do is I'm going to right click on this layer.	O
Actually, let's rename it first.	O
DM.	O
Pink wow DM pink.	O
Marker.	CHITCHAT
Logo right through my mouse off the desk turn I'm going to right click on this layer and I'm going to go to quick export as PNG guys I know I'm flying through this stuff.	O
If you're struggling to keep up, keep in mind there will be a replay on the behalf channel so you should be able to go back to this Lincoln and see things later.	O
So alright, DM pink marker logo.	O
Let's throw this in case actually use it.	O
I'm going to go to my website files.	O
Let's go to my.	CHITCHAT
Will just throw it right in.	CHITCHAT
There was going to throw it right in the mess.	CHITCHAT
Click save.	O
Boom saved come back into my Finder, go back into my.	O
Files there it is.	O
If I hit look at that.	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Super cool hit spacebar.	O
Make it bigger.	O
So now I could use that anywhere.	O
That is awesome.	CHITCHAT
I'm I don't know what I'm going to do with this yet, but I'm really excited to do stuff with it.	CHITCHAT
Now.	CHITCHAT
Let's change your color real quick.	O
Alright, so I'm going to step back command Z.	O
Command Z again will go back.	O
I don't need to.	CHITCHAT
OK, the reason why I stepped back was because I wanted to make a new layer.	O
You'll see, you'll see we're just going to go for it all, right?	CHITCHAT
We're going to duplicate this command J to jump cut it.	O
Turn off the bottom one.	O
And I'm going to click right here on this little lock icon.	O
So right about right next to the word lock, you see a grid at Square and it's got 5 little squares inside of it.	O
Little Checker box.	O
Then click on that.	O
That will lock all of the pixel data.	O
So if so, here's how this works.	CHITCHAT
Let's just jump over here and change color.	O
We're going to make it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know seafoam green or blue or teal are.	O
I don't know there we go blue great.	O
OK, now I don't have to make any selection.	O
I don't have to do the command click thing to get marching.	O
Ants are going to select that.	O
I have to do anything.	CHITCHAT
all I have to do is fill it going to option.	O
And delete.	O
And it immediately fills it with the foreground color, and it's just the pixel data because it got the lock icon right here we turned on this lock thing.	O
So super cool now because I've got my shortcut set up for shift option command and the letter Y, it automatically brings up that trimbox remember that was under image down to trim.	O
And then I can click OK.	O
Help, I goofed up the name again, but DM.	CHITCHAT
No DM marker.	O
When I called it logo blue alright.	O
And we're going to right click.	O
And go down to quick export as PNG.	O
I'll throw it in the same place, hit save, come back into Finder, boom, check it out now I have a blue marker version of my logo signature thing that is so freaking cool.	O
OK, so now are obviously the question is alright.	CHITCHAT
I've got a.	CHITCHAT
The music is I'm feeling it right now.	O
I've got a raster image.	O
Oh hey look, it's me with lots of computers and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Wow squirrel.	CHITCHAT
OK so I've had this raster image.	O
This bitmap image and I want to turn it into something vector.	O

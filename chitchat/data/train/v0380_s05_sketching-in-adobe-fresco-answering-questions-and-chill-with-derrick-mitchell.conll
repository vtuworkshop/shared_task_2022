Right now we're not going to get all the nuances of the brush, but I can take the shape and play with it.	O
So let's do that.	CHITCHAT
Let's come over here.	O
And before I lose my progress, I should probably save this, so we're going to save this.	O
I don't even know where it saves.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's done in my download stack because that's how we brought it in, so I hit save.	O
It's down there.	O
Let's jump into.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, OK, we want to make this a vector, so I am going to command click on it.	O
To get the marching ants and it looks like it just selected the text, not the outer.	O
Yeah, we're good, OK?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to come to this 100 ways to do the things in Photoshop and I'm trying to.	O
I'm trying to think about my life here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, We want to.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's been a minute guys.	CHITCHAT
It's been a minute.	CHITCHAT
I don't remember, let me see what we're doing here.	CHITCHAT
We want to make it a path.	O
Going to do it later when we export it.	O
Oh my gosh, my brain is.	CHITCHAT
Make symmetry path that's new that didn't used to be here before.	O
OK fine.	CHITCHAT
OK, that's what we want to do, so I'm going to delete this symmetry path I was making.	O
Yes, delete the path.	O
OK, so here's where we're at.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start over.	CHITCHAT
OK, we've got this layer.	O
I'm going to command.	O
Click on it.	O
Turn on music just a little bit aggressive command click.	O
We've got a selection.	O
I'm going to hit the letter P to get my pen tool.	O
'cause then I can just right click in here and go to.	O
Or maybe I can Dance?	CHITCHAT
This is what I get for going life trying to do this stuff.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Does that work?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK Alright, Alright one more time so we're not confused got my layer command click on it to get a selection.	O
I'm going to come to my path window, so up here to window down to paths.	O
And then this little hamburger menu.	O
This little drop down we're going to click on that.	O
I'm gonna click on make work path so I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or something changed, but I thought that option used to be there when you have the pen tool and you didn't have to path window how the path window open.	O
So now my tolerance you can mess around with this.	CHITCHAT
I typically leave it as .5.	O
It's going to be a hot mess of lots so if we look at this now it's a work path.	O
So if I turn off this layer you can see it basically is a vector.	O
It's a path, right?	O
So there's a lot of work paths in here.	O
It's a pretty nasty looking.	CHITCHAT
Path, but it is.	CHITCHAT
It can be used as vector, so we're going to do now.	O
We've got this work path here.	O
I'm going to rename it as.	O
DM.	O
Well, I was kind of water calling.	O
I'm calling marker, but whatever.	O
Yeah marker.	CHITCHAT
Logo.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to call this.	O
Vector sample I don't know.	O
Not making stuff up guys.	CHITCHAT
So now what I can do?	CHITCHAT
I've got a path in here in my path window.	O
I can come up here to file.	O
Down to export.	O
Down to paths to illustrator.	O
Go ahead and click on that.	O
And I can select the path.	O
So if you had multiple paths in here, you could pick which one you want, but I want that one will click OK.	O
It turns it into an illustrator file.	O
Do you see where we're going with this?	CHITCHAT
It's going to be cool, click save.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
I've got this DM watercolor.	O
I'm going to double click on it.	O
Let me just click OK.	O
It's going to open up an illustrator and you're like what the heck?	O
Every there's nothing there.	O
Well, it's because all we did was we exported a path without any color or pixel data, right?	O
So if I hit command A to highlight the entire path, I can see it in here now and there might be some things I've gotta clean up.	O
Let's just throw a color in there.	O
All right, so it's close.	O
It's not bad.	CHITCHAT
We've got some things to cut out.	O
All right, So what?	CHITCHAT
I did hit command data, highlight everything.	O
Hit shift M to get my shape builder tool.	O
It's over here in the menu.	O
With everything selected, I'm going to hit the option key to subtract the parts that I want to knockout.	O
Boom Done, I don't know if he has anything in there that I can knockout.	O
Probably not OK, but there you go guys now.	CHITCHAT
I mean Yes someone hit command highlight everything Command G to group it.	O

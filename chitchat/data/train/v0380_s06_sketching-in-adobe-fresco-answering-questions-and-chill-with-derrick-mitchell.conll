And now I can go nuts with it.	CHITCHAT
I can change the colors, you know, whatever you want to do with it, and that is a vector logo that no matter how close I get to it, yes, it's going to be a little jagged because the path came in super nasty.	O
But I can zoom in infinitely in.	O
It's going to remain.	O
Vector versus you know, a raster image.	O
It's going to get blurry.	O
That is really cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, so as far as the watercolor effect on this, you could turn this into a mask if you wanted this to be a vector logo we could apply.	O
I think we could apply gradient mesh.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Mesh tool alright.	O
It's been a long time since I've used the mesh tool.	CHITCHAT
Ah OK, yeah, I know I don't remember how to use it.	CHITCHAT
It's been too long.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully that encourages you though guys, you don't have to know everything.	CHITCHAT
Google is your friend, you can Google it.	CHITCHAT
And figure it out, but for whatever reason.	CHITCHAT
I'm a struggle bus this morning trying to figure out how to use OK, and it could.	CHITCHAT
OK, so it's working there like I thought it would.	CHITCHAT
This music is.	O
Out of control.	O
So you can select different points and you know two different colors in that.	O
Whatever you get the point I was trying to do something like that in here to try and mimic the watercolor effect, but.	O
Either it can't 'cause the shapes too complex or I'm doing something wrong, but what I think I could do still is do a regular gradients at the letter G get a gradient.	O
Let's click over here in the gradient window.	O
If you don't see that.	CHITCHAT
Up to window down too.	O
So just gradient.	O
There it is pop that gradient window.	O
And let's.	CHITCHAT
How do we want to do this?	CHITCHAT
So I'm clicking direct, did just crash illustrated, just crashed anyway.	O
So for the better it probably save me from myself, so that is that was a bunch of stuff that was a bunch of technical stuff for 10 in the morning.	CHITCHAT
I hope you guys enjoyed that.	CHITCHAT
That was a lot of things going from masking in Frisco and doing watercolor stuff and then actually exporting it out to do something cool with it so.	CHITCHAT
I feel like this is a good place to end it because that was just a lot for my brain to do.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to keep sketching and doing things, but I think you know, I think unless you guys have any questions or want me to go over anything.	CHITCHAT
That's a good place to stop.	CHITCHAT
How we doing today?	CHITCHAT

We've got a group of about 16,000 people.	CHITCHAT
It's crazy all doing really cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
Posting their logo designs post in different.	CHITCHAT
You know like this working on fonts, super cool stuff.	CHITCHAT

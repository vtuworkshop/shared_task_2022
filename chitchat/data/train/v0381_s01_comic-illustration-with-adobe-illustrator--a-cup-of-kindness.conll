So this is kind of how I started.	CHITCHAT
I did my regular sketch and then I went through an.	CHITCHAT
I did just some lining and trying to layout where everything was going to be and this is a big process of sketching and kind of just layout and trying to rap the design around the Cup and I was really happy that I tried it and originally this is a teacup and then like towards the end I got the idea to actually make it a measuring Cup so.	O
That's how the final design came to be with the measuring Cup here.	CHITCHAT
I was really happy with how it turned out.	CHITCHAT
I pushed out of my comfort zone and.	CHITCHAT
Really tried to, you know, kind of get it.	CHITCHAT
Get it into a cohesive design and so that then is going to become a real life.	CHITCHAT
Holographic sticker and it's going to be printed all white on the holographic sticker an I think it'll turn out.	CHITCHAT
Really cool.	CHITCHAT
I confirm that they can do that and the mock up pretty much looks exactly like this, so I'm excited to see it and but yeah, so those will be arriving soon.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, bouncing off of this I thought it would be neat to have a comic kind of expounding on that.	CHITCHAT
Idea of starting every day with a Cup of kindness.	O
So this is my initial sketch Phase I start everything out with a very, very rough sketch, just to kind of look at layout and get an idea of what I want to put down on the page and.	O
I will bite you like Italian.	CHITCHAT
But but you know, it's it was I was really excited about it.	O
It's going to be.	CHITCHAT
I've never done a holo sticker and so.	CHITCHAT
I really want to experiment around with different materials and laminates and sticker basis, so I mean not just the traditional.	O
Oh Speaking of stickers I did I want to show a follow up.	CHITCHAT
I don't believe I've shown these on stream here before, but I designed these on stream a couple weeks ago.	CHITCHAT
Is on a Saturday.	CHITCHAT
I went through the setup of the sticker cutline files for these guys an this is the final product of what I designed that day and they turned out really cute and you can see my cutlines their own that well.	O
I don't know if you can see my couplings.	O
I don't know if you can actually there there, I promise.	CHITCHAT
Turned out so well and say I just wanted to show kind of the final product after.	CHITCHAT
After that, that stream on making these an if you want to see that replay it's in my video section.	CHITCHAT
It was on a Saturday and I think it was like.	CHITCHAT
Two or three weeks ago, but yeah, so that was something I've been meaning to show that I keep forgetting on.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so let's get to some comments from here.	CHITCHAT
So what I have to start is I usually.	CHITCHAT
And I met this out last night.	CHITCHAT
I like to get a general layout of what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
'cause sometimes my layouts are continuous.	CHITCHAT
They kind of flow down the page and then I have to think about how I'm going to cut them up later for things like Instagram in different platforms where I post these comics, like for example Instagram has the they have two aspect ratios, they have a square and then they have the slightly taller portrait.	O
But you can only fit so many frames within that size.	O
So if you have a longer comic you have to utilize their swipe.	O
And those 10 frames there, so that's what I usually do.	O
I'm usually thinking about OK, I've got 10 frames and technically 9 because I always like to put like just like information on the comic got in the last frame.	O
Or sometimes I like to do a title card.	O
So if I'm doing a title card, I gotta keep that in mind too.	CHITCHAT
But in this case it's going to be actually pretty simple.	CHITCHAT
Probably going to end up being.	CHITCHAT
I might I might draw this last panel a little bit more detailed like there are in a house or their in their home, and I have all the supporting kind of environment stuff here, but this I think I'm going to keep one frame even though on the original comic I have the words.	O
Cut up over here.	CHITCHAT
This is just my notes for myself on what these little frames are going to be, so the comic is going to go like this.	CHITCHAT
I've got the set up with them having your Cup of kindness and then they go throughout the day doing different good deeds like this one.	CHITCHAT

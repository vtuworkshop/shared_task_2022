Is there picking up trash and cleaning up the environment?	O
This one is there helping an older character across the road and coconuts carrying her groceries.	O
And then this one is going to be there going to take some donations to food bank.	O
And then at the end I'm going to have another line right here.	O
And then I'm going to have a coconut reflecting on how good it made her feel to do that.	O
Could you know, D.	CHITCHAT
For other people so?	CHITCHAT
So cheap here, so that's the that's the.	CHITCHAT
The story line in this comic an let's just get to drawing then.	O
And so OK.	CHITCHAT
The first thing I do is I drop down the transparency of my sketch and it's just so I can still have a guideline and.	O
Then I go over the top in mine it.	O
Anything goes down a little bit.	O
And I work in two layers.	O
I've got my sketch stuff on one layer and then I have the the actual lining art and final work on the second layer.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
It helps me keep things organized in illustrator.	O
Thank you senator.	CHITCHAT
Keep all.	CHITCHAT
I just saw that the hand stuff.	CHITCHAT
Posted posted this stream in their stories and I love the comic.	CHITCHAT
They said it was the spring, as normal, cheap and that was one of the ones that was actually difficult for me because it was a continuous comic, except for the first 2 frames because it has the character walking down through different areas and then coming to another character.	O
And kind of like a Meadow Grove at the bottom so that one was different difficult when in AM.	O
I was really excited too.	CHITCHAT
To see that one through.	CHITCHAT
If you have any questions about the the tools I'm using right now, I'm using the blob brush and I use that to do on my lining.	O
After I have everything set up with the blob brush as far as my lines I go through and I use the pencil tool to do my color fills.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
My hand is not to wind up yet today.	CHITCHAT
So let's go ahead and just.	CHITCHAT
The mental model.	CHITCHAT
What is my point size here?	O
Not sure I like it too much.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I kind of want to move my Contacts at this point.	O
Some of the shortcuts I use all the time.	O
I use the bracket, the bracket keys.	O
To, uh, do my point size of my pin up and down.	O
I also use those same keys to send a group forward and backward in.	O
In my layer and I use.	CHITCHAT
You know I don't use a lot of layers, but my equivalent of layers in illustrator is kind of like groups and I kind of keep a running.	O
Just to kind of check on where all of them are.	O
'cause I usually group characters together.	O
Then I group environment pieces, foreground, middle ground background.	O
So if I want to bring something forward, if I want to hide something behind like a Hill or something, I can do that easily 'cause I just have that character, their line art and their color all in one group.	O
That helps me, especially when I'm doing my daily illustrations.	O
And I've got you know, more elaborate scenes that I'm working on.	CHITCHAT
I kind of want to have her smiling, an momo smiling, so keep that in mind.	O
This is going to be a pretty bare frame.	O
But there are probably move that around, so that's another thing I like to group objects as well, because if I want to change how they're holding something, if I figured out I have not drawn it right, I can just move it around and and keep track of it there as opposed to having a bunch of.	O

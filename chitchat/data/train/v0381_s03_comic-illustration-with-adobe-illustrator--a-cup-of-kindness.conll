A bunch of shapes that.	O
I just kind of sitting out there and.	O
And that's another thing I'll oftentimes go in and.	CHITCHAT
I want to have.	CHITCHAT
This cat showed their hearts in here, just lots of them and what I'm going to do because he's hearts are inside the Carpenters.	CHITCHAT
Gonna Drop This guy down here.	O
Just do that and made it back.	O
So now we have a Cup full of hearts.	O
Kind of bugging so I didn't think of using that comic either.	O
I kind of want to use it.	CHITCHAT
On exchange in the future.	CHITCHAT
Oh shoot well.	CHITCHAT
No, I'm not going to keep that separate.	O
Let's go out to my upper layer is paste that.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
I checked it out so it's alright, I can just I can just group.	O
Only jadion right needs to breathe.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
The real cat that this is based off of has these shoulder.	O
I look at them as patches 'cause she's got an orange one and a Brown one, but there it's pretty symmetrical and it's really interesting to see when she walks, because if you're like, here's here's her head.	O
She's walking, there's men.	O
Here's her body.	O
So she's got the patches like this and it's just it's like she's wearing a Cape and I kind of wanted to.	O
Work that into her character, but I didn't want to make it too difficult for me to draw because I'd be drawing this over and over and over again an if I have one side orange and one side Brown, I'd be like always stressing over which side is which.	O
An did I ask?	CHITCHAT
did I pick writer and I always putting the Orange Patch on her Brown Patch side in that type of deal?	O
So that's one where I kind of decided to simplify.	O
But still keep that that real cue from the the actual cat.	O
She also has this orange cat.	O
And that is it's not all orange, but it's kind of like she's a mixed tabby, so she's got, you know, bits and pieces of everything.	O
But if I blur my eyes and kind of look to see what it averages out to it, it averages out to a pretty vibrant orange.	O
And so that's why I decided to give her that orange cap on her head.	O
And it does kind of cross under her eyes like that.	O
That is a little bit on Coco's character design moment sheet is actually about the same, so I want to keep you know what I'm just going to group.	O
I'm gonna draw Moe and I'm going to group them later.	O
I'll keep the two characters separate inside this group.	O
Normal was about the same deal.	O
She is a mixed was annexed Abby and she kind of averaged out to this caramel browned and she of course had the four White Sox.	O
So I wanted to keep that as one of her main distinguishing features.	O
and I always loved how her.	CHITCHAT
Her forehead stripes were very striking.	O
She had dumb.	CHITCHAT
She had like almost black eyeliner around her eyes.	O
That's what it looked like, and, um, very striking.	CHITCHAT

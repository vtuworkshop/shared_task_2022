Forehead stripes And.	O
But on on the average she was a Brown Patch tabby, and so those are the details I decided to keep for her.	O
And that makes it easy for me to draw and consistently draw this character.	O
And as I increase my Postman steps.	O
Let's actually go into our group.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
As I increase my posting schedule.	O
You know that'll.	CHITCHAT
That's something that you know I I didn't really give enough thought too when I originally started doing comics.	CHITCHAT
I am actually started and stopped quite a bit over the years and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's what I wanna do.	CHITCHAT
Anna, I remember originally Hindu is how are you?	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.	CHITCHAT
All about the tools I'm using or card making more products in general, that's a little bit too rotund.	O
Belly for membership.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Who's your body mind?	CHITCHAT
But I remember starting, you know I did my first real effort like in 2010 and ask how I'm gonna post, you know, three comics a week and I just yeah, no way no way.	CHITCHAT
I had no idea it took me a week to make one.	CHITCHAT
Now at that point I was using keyboard and mouse and I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I didn't have any anywhere near the speed drawing speed that I do now and so that was, you know.	CHITCHAT
Very much an example of biting off more than you can chew, and it's important to keep that in mind if you're considering starting a comic you know, be aware of your capabilities and you know when you're planning your schedule when you're making these commitments to make these posts.	CHITCHAT
Be mindful of the work and you know.	CHITCHAT
Try it out a little bit before you start a firm posting schedule an you can always adjust it.	CHITCHAT
I mean no one says that once you say you're only you're posting on Tuesday, you can't change it from Tuesday.	CHITCHAT
That's silly.	CHITCHAT
What I discovered that I like to do is I'll get used to the schedule that I picked.	CHITCHAT
So like originally for me, it was once a week and then I was like, OK I I feel like I can do two times a week now and now I'm to the point where I'm pretty confident I can get three and I just need to.	CHITCHAT
I need to settle on the timing of that because I kind of have an awkward timing, a lot of a lot of Web Comics are Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Tuesday Thursday, and you know that type of deal, but i'ma Tuesday Friday an then?	CHITCHAT
So where's the other day?	CHITCHAT
and I thought originally I would put it on Sunday, but I'm still 'cause I don't really see a lot of Web comics updating on Sunday and they think of it, but.	CHITCHAT
Search just something to think about if you're looking into web comics.	CHITCHAT
If you're interested in in publishing your own.	CHITCHAT
And also, you know, as with anything, if you're interested in making comics, you gotta read 'em.	CHITCHAT
You gotta find your favorites.	CHITCHAT
You gotta immerse yourself in the.	CHITCHAT
In the industry.	CHITCHAT
Do an upside down heart.	O
Let's do a heart that's kind of an inside.	O
I can erase this back part now.	O
Hello, welcome back Anna.	CHITCHAT

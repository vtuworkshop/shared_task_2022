Get her.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
I was doing it raining outside of my group.	CHITCHAT
Right there we go.	CHITCHAT

Maybe I'm going to help her with a little trash proceeding.	O
And maybe she'll have her back right here.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Kinda wanna have this.	CHITCHAT
Just the edge of this sound.	O
Yes, laughing over here.	O
And since this is being line of the, I might tip this.	O
I might tip this.	CHITCHAT
Can a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Z always drop retail in there and you need to fix your ear after a little bit.	O
And on the website right now, I love you are in place.	CHITCHAT
All Diana.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
I've been, I've been kind of Gung Ho on stickers lately, um.	CHITCHAT
Just because, well, I mean, I love stickers an I stick 'em on everything and it's just it's so much fun to design them and I'm eventually going to figure out how to get them in packs you can actually use on the phone.	CHITCHAT
That's like the next step and I want to do packs for.	CHITCHAT
All of the characters, like the like these sheets right here.	CHITCHAT
I've done, I've got, um.	CHITCHAT
The proofs for the first set and then I've gotta punch the pug set that I finished and.	CHITCHAT
I mean I've made.	CHITCHAT
I've made a lot of individual coconut in moment sheet stickers, but I'd really like to do a pack like an emotive pack like that for them.	CHITCHAT
And of course all of the others happy.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I feel bad 'cause I have like I have a mini set of three for happy.	CHITCHAT
I have the line work, I just haven't finished it and made him.	CHITCHAT
I really kind of need to make a happy paper.	CHITCHAT
Step down instead.	CHITCHAT
But it's just kind of addictive and I use them everywhere.	CHITCHAT
I mean people using planners and you know that some of the things I think about when I'm making them.	CHITCHAT
And like, well where do I see this design?	CHITCHAT
You know, being really useful.	CHITCHAT
'cause like I did one where pudges.	CHITCHAT
He's has a spot, then he's going tap and so you know that could be my thought.	CHITCHAT
There was like maybe an Instagram sticker for, you know, tack right here for a new post.	CHITCHAT
Or if you're using it in your Journal or your planner, he could be pointing to an important day or something like that so.	CHITCHAT
It's really fun for me to go through and think about those and design, and it seems like you know.	CHITCHAT
I have a little bit of a block.	CHITCHAT
When I start up.	CHITCHAT
But once I get rolling 'cause like on the punch set, I was struggling to find I was making a list just kind of doing the brain dump of all the different, you know, happy, sad, high by all the different kind of emotions or whatever I could potentially do an I ended up.	CHITCHAT

Drawing mostly once I came up with after I had started that set.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Kind of on the fly.	CHITCHAT
So it's just, you know, once you get in the mode.	CHITCHAT
And, as in many things, the biggest star.	CHITCHAT
The toughest part is starting.	CHITCHAT
And I found that out and doing a lot of different things.	CHITCHAT
So there's that all.	CHITCHAT
Erase the.	O
Her little body bit right there in a minute.	O
So she's right there and I'm going to have coconut here.	O
She's kind of.	CHITCHAT
She's kind of walking down this path here, and maybe she's picking up some stuff over here.	O
You know those like a bag or something here?	O
Straight from listening.	O
Hey girl, and now since she's in a graph I can erase her really easily.	O
Now she find help.	O
I'm saving up for yes, absolutely.	CHITCHAT
And that's something that I've been looking into.	CHITCHAT
That and my prompt.	CHITCHAT
My big issue is I don't have a Mac an I'm everything is PC, so I don't have an.	CHITCHAT
Apparently you can only code for the iTunes store if you can get on a Mac and use X code and then all of that good stuff, but I did find out recently.	CHITCHAT
You can actually rent a Mac you can like log in an rent a cloud Mac and I could develop on that.	CHITCHAT
So that's my next step that I'm going to try, 'cause otherwise I've been looking in.	CHITCHAT
Seeing if any any of my local friends are getting rid of something really old that they wouldn't mind selling me.	CHITCHAT
I just like I don't really want to buy it just for that, but the cloud rental things are pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
And just as long as my files don't disappear when I log off, I think that would be gravy.	CHITCHAT
But I'm going to definitely.	CHITCHAT
Up Get that one done.	CHITCHAT
Let's get this can drawn.	CHITCHAT
He's kind of having issues.	CHITCHAT

All that good stuff.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And honestly, I don't mind no.	CHITCHAT
That stuff I used to love programming.	CHITCHAT
But it just seems like when I.	CHITCHAT
When I would do it for my website, that was a big block because I would always end up breaking something.	CHITCHAT
And that was never fun and it was always something silly like I had forgotten to close a set of tags or something.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Thank goodness for the days of content management systems now.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much, Dana.	CHITCHAT
I got them on.	CHITCHAT
I've gotten the stickers on Jiffy.	CHITCHAT
I was able to get a creator account there and so if you want to use them on Instagram, all you need to do is search.	CHITCHAT
Be cute and it'll bring up all the stickers that I've done so far for Instagram stories.	CHITCHAT
You can also use them in your DMS and.	CHITCHAT
How is miss you so happy when I see someone use them?	CHITCHAT

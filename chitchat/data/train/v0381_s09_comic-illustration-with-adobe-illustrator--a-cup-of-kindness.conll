Actually, I need to fill in this character.	O
I need to make coconut appear.	O
He done some really cool pixel art, some ice creams, isometrics, stuff.	CHITCHAT
You could totally do your 3D printing stuff.	CHITCHAT
The next group mystical being.	O
I need to change a second.	O
Want her walking down.	O
Tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
Make that a little smaller.	O
Heishin or how are you?	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna have to move her over a little bit because I don't want to have their tails walking each other.	O
Just get her drawn in here and I can kinda just one way or another.	O
She's gonna be picking stuff up over here.	O
And she's going to have her little bag she's holding onto here.	O
Smaller.	O
Maybe it's dragging.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, she's dragging it down.	O
A Hunter.	CHITCHAT
People.	CHITCHAT
Can't wait to get home.	CHITCHAT
Brush I'm using is the blob brush.	O
It's right over here.	O
I think it's usually hidden underneath like in the.	CHITCHAT
Me out of the box tool set and the default one.	CHITCHAT
I think it's hidden beneath something else, but on mine I have I pop out the tools that I use the most right over here.	CHITCHAT
So blah brushes what I used to sketch and I use the pencil tool for my color fills.	CHITCHAT
So like for example on this one I use the blob brush for the line art and then these were just really easy to kind of.	O
Just fill in and create with the pencil tool.	O
And these settings that I use.	O
This song is it really bass heavy?	O
That's bugging me.	CHITCHAT
Wow, sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So the settings I have for the blob brush I like so.	O
Uh, my lips no, don't want to do that I have.	CHITCHAT
Pressure sensitivity right here an I make sure to have the variations that equal to the point size.	CHITCHAT
That means that it basically.	CHITCHAT
Depending on the pressure, can double size and also you know have it.	O
And then the angle I have is 67 and then I have a little bit of a pinch on the brush tip that helps me 'cause I do.	O
I do some writing like I'll do sound effects and I'll just use my handwriting.	O
That gives it a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I just like the line quality of it.	O
So there's that my settings there and then when I'm drawing I'll use these bracket tools up and down.	O
You can kind of see it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah you can see it.	CHITCHAT
You can see how the bracket tool is increasing and decreasing the.	O

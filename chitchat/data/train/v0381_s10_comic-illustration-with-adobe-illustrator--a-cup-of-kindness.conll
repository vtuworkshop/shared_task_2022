The tip size on the brush.	O
No, but you need to make a lot smaller now.	O
So she's dragging this, so we're going to have.	O
And she's kind of holding it so.	O
I wanna have Queen size.	O
This was really bass heavy to Gosh.	O
I have it on in my head set an if it.	CHITCHAT
Basically it's too heavy, it just really vibrates.	O
Up here and it causes a headache so I gotta be careful about that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's get hurt.	CHITCHAT
Stripes here and I'm going to just put a tip of her little toe, so if I were to actually draw this out, her leg would be like that and I don't need to draw more because the bag is blocking it.	O
And I just need to drop that out here and they super tail.	O
And then I need to put her little shoulder.	O
Is your shoulders gonna be?	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT

It's really good.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll have it.	CHITCHAT
Best.	CHITCHAT
And kind of sitting here in the grass.	O
A little bit concealed.	O
And then maybe I can start to strengthen that little bit.	O
Maybe I'll do.	CHITCHAT

Still a little bit more kind of a fluffy greens.	O
Inside this bag of groceries.	O
Fix the sound a little bit.	O
There's farm don't fight like.	CHITCHAT
Hey Ryan, how are you today?	CHITCHAT
How's it going for you?	CHITCHAT
I am drawing some groceries.	O
Almost done.	CHITCHAT
With this crosswalk.	O
And then actually I think I am done.	CHITCHAT
I need to hold up here.	O
Delete that.	O
And I need to delete some of these extra lines.	O
Crossing here.	O
Those.	CHITCHAT
Well, in that way.	CHITCHAT
Characters are helping Granny bear cross the road today.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Please let me know which tools you're using for handwriting.	O
Oh, that are.	CHITCHAT
Let's see I use actually this is just blah brush and I usually do that with sound effects.	O
The only thing I'll use the text tool for in the comic is the regular comic text.	O
I like to keep that consistent and use my font there.	O
But as far as this stuff it's just wild brush and I.	O
Increase the font size 1 size the tip size on the brush.	O
Up and down as I need it and then here are the settings right here.	O
Right now the size of the point is 13, but this is what I keep constant.	O
The angle at 67 and the roundness at 85.	O
I like a little pinch on the tip just to give it, especially if I'm doing stuff with lettering.	O
It gives a little I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I just like it.	CHITCHAT
It feels like a pocket brush pen to me, especially when when I do.	O
Stuff like this, you know, and I press hard to get that big line variance that is exactly what I do with my pentel pocket brush pen when I'm doing traditional stuff, so I kind of wanted to create.	O
Something that would function like that for my comics, which I need to save.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So like.	CHITCHAT
Like here I have two indications right here.	O
I'm going to have text here and text here.	O
I'm gonna go ahead and just drop that in there show you.	O
Uhm, yeah, that's where is my service.	CHITCHAT
So that's my regular comic text.	O
And all arrange these differently.	O

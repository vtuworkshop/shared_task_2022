I'm probably going to divide this up to keep get it even I don't like that.	O
The center area started staying clean.	O
Nails and go.	CHITCHAT
And then I'll give them a little bit of shattering underneath.	O
And here the good deeds are doing throughout the day and the last one is going to be making deliveries to a food pantry.	O
And then she's going to be reflecting on how good that made her feel.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, if you have any other questions, just let me know.	CHITCHAT
The blob brush is wonderful.	O
Uhm, I think.	CHITCHAT
Is pretty close if you're used to like drawing in in photo shop in doing line work there.	O
I feel like this is pretty close to that.	O
I mean, this is my main sketch tool that I use all the time and I'll come through and I do like this is my thing I did yesterday.	O
I did all my line work here and you can see.	O
That over this is my starting sketch and sketched it all with the blob brush tool.	O
Did all of the kind of rough.	O
You know organization of the design here and then I came through and didn't want to do that.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I came through and did all the final leiningen lettering with that.	O
Southland brush and then when I wanted to color it, I came over here with my pencil tool and I created my fills and it's pretty much drawing with the BLOB brush and coloring with the pencil tool and then when I do shading.	O
Also I'll use both.	O
Depends on the size of the area that I'm trying to shade.	O
If it's a smaller area, I'll just pick up the blob brush.	O
If it's a larger area, I'll draw the shapes in the pencil tool.	O
But yeah, I'm really excited about how this turned out.	O
It's going to be on a holographic sticker, and it's going to be printed at all in white.	O
And then this is the regular version.	O
I may do two versions of that sticker depending on how.	O
That comes out, but let's see.	O
So this is turning out.	O
I kinda wanna do.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I can mess around with you arrangement later.	CHITCHAT
Let me just get this.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Fixed up.	CHITCHAT
All right, so next is making a.	CHITCHAT
You know I could.	CHITCHAT
I could give these guys more stage.	O
I could blow them up.	O
I could do this over Eclipse.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
I figured this more room over here.	O
And have this panel right here.	O
I kind of like that.	CHITCHAT
Christmas can't lose my indication for my.	O
My text, so if I do that I can move this guy right here.	O
So it'll kind of flow.	O
Supposed to that.	CHITCHAT
Because these are all text list panels.	O
I kind of like the flow of that better.	O
So if I am, I can take these two out.	O
It doesn't even more.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like that a lot.	CHITCHAT
That 'cause I like the detail I put into these panels an I want to showcase that more so if that is the.	O
OK, that is the case.	CHITCHAT
Then I want to have this panel waited to point this direction.	O
So let's figure that out.	CHITCHAT
This is, uh?	CHITCHAT
Alright, helping across the street.	O
Then we have the Food Bank.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I could have let me just sketch this out a little bit better.	O
I wanna have them frames.	O
Alright, so this is going to be kind of this is a smaller leading.	O

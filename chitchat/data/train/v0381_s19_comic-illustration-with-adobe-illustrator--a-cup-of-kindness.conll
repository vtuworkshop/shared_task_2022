She's pointing over here and then.	O
This is going to lead here.	O
I like that.	CHITCHAT
So there's going to be a food bank in the background so this will be like kind of like this.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And so there on that road.	O
And then there's my text on that one.	O
Alright, yay.	CHITCHAT
That was the only panel I hadn't figured out last night.	CHITCHAT
I knew I wanted to do something with food donation, and I'm really glad I decided to open this up a little bit.	O
Alright, so then this last one is going to be.	O
I'm gonna go ahead and drop this down to.	O
Percent.	CHITCHAT
And I'm gonna go over here and there, grab.	O

The difference begins inside you.	O
Times.	CHITCHAT
Make that a little bigger and kind of like how this is flowing, so this will be.	O
Add a little bit.	CHITCHAT

If you are working on something, be sure to save and take a stretch for yourself too.	CHITCHAT
That's actually one of the things I wanted to switch my screen too.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to do some.	CHITCHAT
Hand exercises for artists and that type of thing.	CHITCHAT
I think that could actually be a comic in itself.	CHITCHAT

I need to write it down.	CHITCHAT
Tips for OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so just to show I haven't showed this yet.	CHITCHAT
Today on I get asked a lot where I come up with my ideas and this is a look at my my idea book.	CHITCHAT

When I sit down to write I start with a goal.	CHITCHAT
Just fill a page.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't matter if it's just a word list Word Association, if it's a brain dump or if I actually have ideas that are more.	CHITCHAT
Crystallized in that sometimes.	CHITCHAT

And then he was like, yeah, I know what inktober is.	CHITCHAT
If it is freeing, so why don't you want to try thinking something for once and then so many?	CHITCHAT
If you like this style so many people got mad at him like dude, it's a suggestion really come on and I honestly feel about using different mediums are like is super Super Awesome.	CHITCHAT
You could learn a lot by trying different things.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
And some people are like some people don't have access to inking.	CHITCHAT
I was like dude, it's a pen and a piece of paper.	CHITCHAT
You're telling me you're OK?	CHITCHAT
You can use your desktop and a Wakeham tablet, but you can't get a piece of paper and a pen like.	CHITCHAT
But each time I found lying.	CHITCHAT
I just I was just very confused and like it was a suggestion.	CHITCHAT
At that.	CHITCHAT
I want to actually like I did for a little bit, and then I realized how rusty I was.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Anne, what sort of pitfalls that I?	CHITCHAT
Went into because I was doing digital for so long.	CHITCHAT
Example what I'm doing right now.	CHITCHAT
Images lasso tooling my sketch right?	CHITCHAT
And then moving things around.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
In the digital world, that's commonplace.	CHITCHAT
In the real world, that's like you are either erase it.	CHITCHAT
If you get a light box and he's trying.	CHITCHAT
You try to redo it, you just start over in the scrap it and that's that's the options there.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
He learned from different mediums.	CHITCHAT
There are times I bring traditional techniques into digital and Vice Versa.	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
And you know what?	CHITCHAT
It's all art.	CHITCHAT
It's all amazing art stuff.	CHITCHAT
Right now it's all creative stuff.	CHITCHAT
It's unbraced different mediums.	CHITCHAT
You've done a traditional stream on here, right?	CHITCHAT
Already, Diane.	CHITCHAT
Passy, I'm calling you by your birth name.	CHITCHAT
I forgot to turn off notifications do not disturb.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't pain in the butt?	CHITCHAT
I think my setup is probably a lot easier than yours.	CHITCHAT
Who shoot?	CHITCHAT
Oh, I was going to ask you what's your light?	CHITCHAT
My light setup is literally a desk lamp.	CHITCHAT
With a piece of paper over it to diffuse the light, 2 pieces of paper over it.	CHITCHAT
And I saw your lamp.	CHITCHAT
That on your Instagram and I'm like that looks fancy.	CHITCHAT
How much was that?	CHITCHAT
If it's more than like $50 if it's more than 20 'cause I've seen it go for 30.	CHITCHAT
If it's more than 20 or 30 then.	CHITCHAT
After now, but I'm hoping not that expensive.	CHITCHAT
So I got a killer that's more than 100.	CHITCHAT
OK, never mind.	CHITCHAT
Never mind, you know what I got for my birthday next confused.	CHITCHAT
Why did charity stream?	CHITCHAT

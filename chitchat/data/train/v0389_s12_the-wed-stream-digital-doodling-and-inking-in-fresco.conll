Minimal line work.	O
Still reads very, very well, but what else like?	CHITCHAT
I have preached right.	CHITCHAT
That the lines should be different throughout the picture, right?	O
Because of their lines are two equal throughout a picture, kind of like blurs together.	O
But For this I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It kind of looks like.	CHITCHAT
That the lines on the outside, which is like framing the character, is the same length, or in the same width as the lines of the inside.	O
For the most part, there there's some battered like around the cheek area that's a little bit thinner, but it seems consists consistent.	O
See, that's something that I have to learn.	CHITCHAT
I think that's the dad right there going to draw her.	O
If I can mimic that just like the consistent line throughout the whole character.	O
It's a low res version of her though.	O
Kind of low rise.	O
That's fine though.	CHITCHAT
Going in my sketching pencil I would do that whenever before I start drawing.	O
Uh, both Cassie finning and then I deleted.	O
One of the best ways, and like Diane, was in here 2 census was in here not too long ago where you got here, take me, there were talking and we were saying like we should go back to doing some ink, ink and on paper.	O
Thinking on paper, nothing.	CHITCHAT

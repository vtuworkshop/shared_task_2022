My neighbors just opening and shutting their garage door right as I go live.	CHITCHAT
It's humiliating.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think were ready.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys do not know what I'm talking about, I'm doing a series of 6 characters for the art station challenge.	O
If you go to artst.com, you'll see at the very top they have some tabs.	O
One of them says challenges if you click the challenges tab at the top, you'll see challenge is called the box of mystery.	O
I'm doing the character version.	O
There's a few others you can do, like an environment, one prop design, key, frame design animation, that kind of thing.	O
But I'm doing characters 'cause That's what I do and I'm kind of incorporating it into the theme of the world building project I'm doing.	O
Long story short, and I'll give you my little, that's not the right tab.	CHITCHAT
This is the right tab, my little spiel, but I've been doing this world building project for a few months now.	CHITCHAT
Primarily I was using this stream here on be hands to work on that, 'cause I'm usually busy with freelance work and that kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
But I've actually been freed up from freelance for a little bit, taking a bit of a break before I jump back into it, so I've just been working on this.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, it's going to be an interactive map of lower and legends.	O
Essentially this map I would create that you could click around on and click icons that represent different characters, creatures, factions, and kingdoms so I do a lot of characters and creatures, but really just anything I want to populate this world with.	O
It's kind of an excuse to do that.	CHITCHAT
This does not exist yet.	CHITCHAT
This was just initial mock up I did to kind of visualize it to maybe see what it could look like.	CHITCHAT
I'd certainly going to change, but we're in the stage now past the mock up where I actually want to concept out the things that exist in this world and by concept out, I don't mean just do like a character painting and throw it in there, you know actually want some story and some thought and some design iterations variations there.	CHITCHAT
I want to work through and really find the designs and not just go with the first one that pops into my head.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So what we've done so far for that project?	O
Are these different characters trying to come up with the races and the people in the creatures that live in this world?	O
It's kind of the most natural place to start for me as a character designer.	CHITCHAT
I've never done a world building project in any real capacity before.	CHITCHAT
But this is the way that makes the most sense to me, so I got this far where I kind of got random sketches out of my head on the paper.	O
And then I went in and I started painting them and exploring designs a little bit further.	O
Now there's a ton more to do, but these are what I've come up with so far.	CHITCHAT
I'm taking a bit of a break on that to do this artstation challenge, which is designed 6 characters, so it's like specific characters.	CHITCHAT
So far I've just been doing like the races that exist in this world.	O
No specific characters, no one of significance or importance.	O
Just generally, what do they look like?	CHITCHAT
So this is a little bit different.	CHITCHAT
We're getting more specific, but I thought it would be cool if I could use this artist station challenge in my world building project if I want to.	CHITCHAT
Like if I like these characters and I like the story behind them in the idea behind them, I could put them in it so you know, unless I don't like it, I may have to tweak the story.	O
There's a lot of things I can do, but I'll probably end up using these ideas for my project in some way or another.	CHITCHAT
So with that said, We're working on 6 characters.	O
May pop up the original sketches.	O
And these six characters are supposed to have certain characteristics about them, so from left to right there's a serious character, a brave character, a joyful character, a mischievous character, a wild character, and a leader character.	O
So they're part of this group.	O
I'm calling them the protectors of the second realm.	O
Long story short, these Giants exist in the second realm.	O
They're kind of like mythological creatures, but they can step between realms kind of magical.	O
Not not everyone has seen them or believes they exist.	O
But there's a way to enter into the second realm from the primary one, and there's this ancient group that's basically tasked with keeping that secret keeping it.	O
Out of the hands of people and that these people and they all have a different job in a task, the joyful one.	CHITCHAT
The big guy in the middle, for example, is the diplomat between realms.	O
You wanted.	CHITCHAT
The very left is the serious character.	O
He is the historian, the scholar, the one who knows the most about the history of this organization.	O
Uhm, yeah, they all kind of different job, so I've done some of these.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here, leader concepts.	O
None of these are done by any means.	CHITCHAT
This is just me trying to get whatever ideas I have out of my head onto paper, but sometimes will not, sometimes.	CHITCHAT
But when I do that, I can then determine am I on the right path or not?	O
do I like it?	CHITCHAT
Is the direction the right one?	CHITCHAT
Or do I shift directions?	CHITCHAT
This is the only real way I can figure that out as I start putting ideas down and then I'm like alright, this one is not what I want, but this one is getting closer.	CHITCHAT
And then I explored that app and do a little bit further until I really find what I like.	CHITCHAT

Can be time consuming.	CHITCHAT
Well I would say this is actually pretty fast, but it can definitely take awhile.	CHITCHAT
Like the more you want to spend exploring it.	CHITCHAT
Trying to find the sweet spot.	CHITCHAT
Because.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot to do in a short period of time.	CHITCHAT
Since the brave character, what do we just do?	CHITCHAT
We did the mischievious character let me pop that up.	O
So none of these are done, my due, just really rough sketches, so that's kind of what we've been doing Jennifer.	CHITCHAT
Good see you by the way, wish I could come up with characters or creatures you totally can.	CHITCHAT
I mean there's nothing special about what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
When I should write is that I wish I could draw my characters.	CHITCHAT
And yes, I know it's the same dedication.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's really just practice, I mean.	CHITCHAT
Like there's the fundamentals of structure in perspective and all that, and I guess you could say anatomy as well, but it's like the more you draw the human figure, the more you study it.	O
The more you explore that, the more natural it gets.	CHITCHAT
It's not confusing anymore.	CHITCHAT
It's not a foreign concept, it's just like something you deal with everyday.	CHITCHAT
Then costumes can be tough.	O
You know, like I think it's definitely possible to.	CHITCHAT
Get better at like creativity and get better at costume design.	CHITCHAT
Building up your visual library and.	CHITCHAT
Flexing those creative muscles.	CHITCHAT
I think that's what Tyler said.	CHITCHAT
Imagination is a muscle.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I agree.	CHITCHAT
I've heard some people say like.	CHITCHAT
You can learn the technical skills in art, but like creativity you have it or you don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't agree with that.	CHITCHAT
Think imagination, creativity, all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
I agree the muscle, the more you use it, the more developed it gets.	CHITCHAT
Case in point.	CHITCHAT
No, that's not what I want.	CHITCHAT
Where is it?	CHITCHAT
Where is it?	CHITCHAT
Here is my one of my earlier character designs.	O
When I started drawing super original right?	O
So basically a gladiator guy.	O
With the Dragon Ball Z shoulder pad.	O
Needs to watch Dragon Ball Z.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But like you definitely kind of get used to like what makes good design, you know.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, with that said, We're going to be jumping into it.	O
Get rid of this guy.	O
Get outta here.	O
Go on get outta here.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like this darker background I don't know.	O
It helps the.	CHITCHAT
It helps the white stand out more.	O
I don't like it for some reason.	CHITCHAT
It's like easier on my eyes.	CHITCHAT
Straight on this.	CHITCHAT
BG two so we're going to work on this character a little bit.	O
It looks too dark, I think.	O
Maybe 'cause all his clothing is leather.	O
It's all dark tones, so maybe.	O
Maybe it works better.	O
I kind of want to.	CHITCHAT
Let's do a little.	CHITCHAT
Start tool capture.	CHITCHAT
There we go before we do anything, so I'm going to do CTRL L for levels.	O
To do like a straight up levels boost brightness boost.	O
Contrast boost.	CHITCHAT
Sure, why not?	CHITCHAT
All right, so this is the pose we're going to use, but right now we're trying to work on the costume, and the costume is going to be.	O
Figured out and then drawn on to these characters.	O
So I very well may change their their pose.	O
This is a rough idea.	CHITCHAT
You can see it's not really worked out 'cause I want to get their costume in there to the silhouette.	O
Could very well change the pose and what I mean by that is depending what their costume is, it may look better if their poses tweaked.	O
So I'm not going to super in depth with that, but until we can get to that, we still have two more characters to do.	O
This series character on the left and the wild character right here.	O
The other ones have been touched upon.	O
The joyful character here in the middle of the big guy.	O
His costumes are I can't even count that I barely touched on him.	O

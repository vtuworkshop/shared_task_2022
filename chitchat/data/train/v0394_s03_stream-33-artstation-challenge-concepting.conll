But anyway, let's focus up.	CHITCHAT
I think I got some references.	CHITCHAT
We're just going to play around big shapes.	O
Till I find something I like.	CHITCHAT
Excuse my yawning.	CHITCHAT
After like warm up.	CHITCHAT
The stream.	CHITCHAT
With talking.	CHITCHAT
Season professional So it can you link your artstation challenge submission so I can give it some attention.	O
I have not submitted anything yet.	CHITCHAT
I really, really, really, really need to do that this weekend.	CHITCHAT
'cause I mean, after this weekend there's like 2 weeks.	CHITCHAT
So I haven't posted anything I need to update my artstation first and foremost because I haven't done that in awhile, but then I need to actually start posting like on it with the challenge so.	CHITCHAT
I can put my art station in the chat.	CHITCHAT
It's out of date though, like if you check here on be hands.	CHITCHAT
You'll see more updated work that my heart station.	CHITCHAT
I've always been bad about that, which is not good 'cause art stations, an important social media to keep updated pure in that industry.	CHITCHAT
So that's what I got in there, but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll hopefully be able to update that this weekend.	CHITCHAT
Sam, you damn fool, you have to upload.	CHITCHAT
Some people can follow along.	CHITCHAT
I know, I know I haven't had time.	CHITCHAT
I'm swamped.	CHITCHAT
So swamped But I will try.	CHITCHAT
Try this weekend, Tyler.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'll make you proud.	CHITCHAT
Just you wait.	CHITCHAT
So what I do is I get some basic.	CHITCHAT
Ideas down and then I go back and I reworked the weakest ideas like this shoulder pad type of thing is just one idea and then I have another.	CHITCHAT
Idea, I don't know it would be this one, but.	CHITCHAT
Let me see where is my reference.	CHITCHAT
Alright, Oh yeah yeah gotcha.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I just said gotcha talking to myself.	CHITCHAT
I was looking for a certain reference.	CHITCHAT
So I was thinking some sort of.	O
Studded armor, what would you call it?	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
So I wanted to have leather armor.	O
He's supposed to be able to move kinda quick.	O
He's a soldier essentially for this group.	O
All the other groups aren't really soldiers.	O
The closest one would be the mischievous character who is an illusionist.	O
She basically tries to intercept people who are trying to pass into the second realm.	O
If they get that far, or if she can redirect their plans at all, that's what she'll do.	O
So basically she can create illusions to confuse or Misdirect people.	O
And she's also a bit of a sabot or so.	O
Like you know, maybe she'd be messing up a wagon or doing whatever she can to sneak in and.	O
Destroy things, but she's mostly kind of this passive illusionist.	O
Meanwhile, this guy combat is actually needed.	O
That's where he comes in.	O
He actually needs to fight someone.	O
So he's the only one wearing leather.	O
But even with that, the idea is that.	CHITCHAT
He's kind of quick.	O
He's not going to try to, you know he's a single single fella going to say single man, but he's clearly not a man.	CHITCHAT
He may come in and like.	O
Hit and run.	O
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Like come in and attack and then.	O
Before that, people know what hit them.	O
He's already running off into the forest.	O
So he needs to be kind of quick.	O
And that requires.	O
Well, armor that's not too cumbersome armor that's not too heavy.	O

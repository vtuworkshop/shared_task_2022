As far as antlers go, I don't know.	O
We could try some cool antlers.	O
Aunt Les, Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
I'm literally just going to Google Cool Aunt blurs.	CHITCHAT
You know, I've recommended this site before, Yandex, I've said how it has better images than Google does, but I never use it.	O
I always forget to if I'm looking at landscapes.	CHITCHAT
I've used it for sure, but I haven't used it for casual searches, so I'm going to Google Cool Aunt Flyers for Yandex spelled like it sounds YANDX.	O
See the difference between Google.	CHITCHAT
His landscapes have certainly determined that it's better for.	O
But for casual searches.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
A little bit the results on Yandex seem to be actual like images of antlers.	CHITCHAT
Whereas some of 'em on uh?	CHITCHAT
Google are like a chair made out of antlers or a print on someones wall oven.	CHITCHAT
Illustrated cool guy deer or a suck with a deer on it.	CHITCHAT
So we're a table with the same cool guy deer print on it.	O
Let's see index, probably.	CHITCHAT
Probably wins this one too.	CHITCHAT
Either way.	CHITCHAT
Fit in some.	O
Ibex Horns.	O
So I put these horns on costume later.	O
I don't want that.	CHITCHAT
Make an antler layer.	O
There will save it.	O
Wolf the nightly how you doing.	CHITCHAT
At home.	CHITCHAT
How does a rhino horn look?	O
He could charge people quickly and Pierce them.	O
Rhino horn.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'm kind of decided these guys have two horns.	O
But I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I mean, they could definitely be an interesting idea to play with now.	O
the Giants that have created they have kind of a single horn.	O
Just the idea I had for them for whatever reason.	CHITCHAT
Could be interesting to play with that for them.	O
You doing fine things.	CHITCHAT
Glad to hear it.	CHITCHAT
Wolf, appreciate you being here.	CHITCHAT
Is often as you are.	CHITCHAT
And by here I just mean in the stream.	CHITCHAT
Not necessarily be hands.	CHITCHAT
You're too kind.	CHITCHAT
Looks like some nice armor concepts.	O
Thanks man, I'm hoping to find something good.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it's not really super out of my comfort zone, just armor but.	CHITCHAT
Like I wish I could just dedicate more time to this stage of it because there's.	CHITCHAT

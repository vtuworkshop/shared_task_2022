Like I enjoy the thought process in this costume development.	O
It's all shapes and I don't know there's.	CHITCHAT
You know, like this, There's just so much shape.	O
And patterning going on.	O
But I can.	CHITCHAT
I can push it so much.	CHITCHAT
Same with this one like I could really spend quite some time on these.	CHITCHAT
But You know, I just wouldn't have any time to actually finish these characters if I did that.	CHITCHAT
So what I might have to do?	CHITCHAT
Is just kind of get this.	CHITCHAT
Use this to get the ideas out.	CHITCHAT
Excuse me and then just try to finish the characters with the best ideas I have and then come back to this for portfolio purposes later on.	CHITCHAT
Touch it up a little bit if I really want to now.	CHITCHAT
The ideal way to do it, of course, but.	CHITCHAT
May not have time otherwise.	CHITCHAT
I was also thinking of this idea before I forget.	CHITCHAT
I'm having like these almost.	CHITCHAT
What if you had blades on his?	CHITCHAT
His arms.	CHITCHAT
If he's running through a crowd, is pushing his way out with his arms thrashing around, you could.	O
Potentially get cut with that these blades, I don't know.	O
He's a thrasher.	O
Thrashes and slashes.	O
Gosh Dang it Sam.	CHITCHAT
Pay attention air layers.	O
Not a bad idea to.	CHITCHAT
To lock the layers you're not working on.	O
Costume and then we got her.	O
I don't even know if these things have here, but trying out the idea.	CHITCHAT
And we got horns.	O
Is perfect.	O
This reference is perfect, I should say.	O
You guys can't see it, but it's like the same angle.	O
It's never happens.	CHITCHAT
I never get like perfect reference.	O
So weird when I have it 'cause I'm like, Oh I could just.	CHITCHAT
Literally like copy it.	O
I think it's really good practice too.	O
Have to interpret reference to understand what the shape is an like translated into a different view or something like that.	O
Apply lighting and colors of one photo into a completely different type of form you know, like.	O
Givers, type of face of one person and translating it onto a completely different looking person that you created.	O
Think it's always good, just 'cause those.	CHITCHAT
Those instances really.	CHITCHAT
Keep you.	CHITCHAT
Thinking.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to lock the transparencies of this layer.	O
Get an airbrush and.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
This is like really small minor thing, but there's like some reflected light in these horns on the reference.	O
I just think it looks cool, so I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do that.	CHITCHAT
Unlock the transparencies so I can erase this a little bit.	O
I remember the time when I used to stop.	CHITCHAT
Think I stopped using clipping masks.	O
Because I found them too tedious and not flexible enough to update and I look back and I have to laugh at myself 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I work now and what I feel like is is a way that is there's no lack of flexibility, but between clipping masks and.	O
Lock transparencies Can really quickly.	O
Control my edges without any any actual issues.	O
But you know, workflows are always growing, evolving as you learn so.	CHITCHAT

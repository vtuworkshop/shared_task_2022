There's these twisty horns which are pretty cool.	O
Dad through these different.	CHITCHAT
They look like 3D models in that like, not as life like you mean.	O
Yeah, I remember thinking the anatomy 360 was pretty cool because it is actually.	O
Scanned images which looks a lot more believable.	O
I guess that has been my apprehension with.	O
Some of those 3D things too.	O
Like A lot of times, if you're.	O
Posing or getting referenced from 3D security.	O
Getting reference from something that's fake and kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Dead looking, sometimes those three things would look, but.	CHITCHAT
Anatomy 360 it's just a scan from life.	O
That's very true, though I haven't seen Daz 360 myself, so I don't know if it's actually like pretty decent or.	O
It's been awhile since I've looked at it.	CHITCHAT
I've never actually used it though.	CHITCHAT
But like any reference that you don't have to copy any of that stuff completely, can just use it to reference whatever you really need, whether that's lighting or perspective and.	O
Kind of.	CHITCHAT
Combine references that looks pretty good.	O
I'm looking at these horns, by the way.	O
If anyone's wondering what I'm referencing right now, pretty nuts, right?	O
They look like cartoons or game characters, and as do they, huh?	O
I remember them being that bad, but yeah, I guess I really don't know.	CHITCHAT
I haven't checked out anatomy 360 for awhile either.	CHITCHAT
It's very possible they have a lot of new stuff that I haven't seen.	CHITCHAT
It is paid right like a lot of it's paid or some of it at least.	CHITCHAT
I know they think give out some free stuff, but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I could definitely be worthwhile.	CHITCHAT
I think for studying purposes I could get a lot out of that.	CHITCHAT
Haven't been doing proper studies for some time.	CHITCHAT
Sweet what we got.	CHITCHAT
Some good, um, variation in horns here.	O
Kind of like copy this one and.	O
But maybe like modified a little bit.	O
How do I didn't even do any like moose antlers?	O
What happened in that?	CHITCHAT
What happened to the moose antlers?	CHITCHAT
They just delete it.	CHITCHAT
Dad looks better now than it did years ago.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I remember last time I checked it and think I recall looking too bad.	CHITCHAT

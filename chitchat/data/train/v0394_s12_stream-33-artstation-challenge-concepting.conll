I use the warp tool all the time for quick little.	O
Just means like that.	CHITCHAT
Make these slightly smaller 2.	O
And these feel like they could be smaller.	O
Merge these together.	O
Shrink him down a bit.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put antlers.	O
All in their own group, so these three layers is just group those to keep it organized.	O
Sorry, you guys can't see my layers, but.	CHITCHAT
I put all three layers here.	O
In one group.	O
At his hair on one layer is costing one layer is body on one layer.	O
Alright, sweet so.	CHITCHAT
How we're doing pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Pretty good on time.	CHITCHAT
Unlock the body layer.	O
Just realize adding lock.	O
That's a bad idea so.	O
Think I'm feeling pretty good about the horns.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Costume, think I had some ideas.	O
I wanted to try.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if I can recall what they are.	CHITCHAT
I swear I had something I wanted to try.	CHITCHAT
I'm already kind of did this one in the bottom left.	O
Like a.	CHITCHAT
Just a bigger idea.	O
I'll just sketch around.	O
We'll see what we can do, and I may try to jump into the.	O
The serious character before we go today.	O
So we got like.	CHITCHAT
Actually, yeah, we got a little while.	CHITCHAT
We haven't been live that long.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we got about an hour.	CHITCHAT
Just under an hour.	CHITCHAT
Well, weird glitch there, let's say, but I think I have been saving it but.	CHITCHAT
Anytime I see a glitch, man.	CHITCHAT
Reminds me to save.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But the series character will be doing some robes and stuff for him.	O
Think I was want to put some buckles on this one.	O
Small little thing that I remembered.	CHITCHAT
So you can see I try to put down the ideas like is loose and quickly as possible.	O
If it's not working, then I've wasted no time, but just enough to.	CHITCHAT
Play with the idea and see how it would look.	O
Then I can always go in there and fix it up.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Feel like I could definitely go a different direction with this.	CHITCHAT

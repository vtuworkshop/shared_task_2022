How did I botch that?	CHITCHAT
Can I fix that light midstream?	O
Yeah, I was doing a real quick and I wasn't paying attention.	CHITCHAT
I think I copied that from a previous stream actually, so I must have gotten it wrong on a previous dream.	CHITCHAT
Now I don't think I can edit it off to edit after the fact.	O
Yeah, my Twitter, if you guys just Google Twitter Sam Peterson art if you search any of my social media in the same Peterson out, you'll probably find them without too much issue.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for the heads up, Henry.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even realize that.	CHITCHAT
So this costume here.	O
I don't think it's doing it.	CHITCHAT
It's cool.	O
Like it could be kind of the civilian in town type thing.	O
I like that, but for this purpose it's it's not really working.	CHITCHAT
But I'm kind of liking this like in something about this.	CHITCHAT
So I want to do this in the modify it.	O
Excuse me so.	CHITCHAT
Gotta go shirtless for that barbarian look trying to mix that barbarian looking like.	O
Something else.	CHITCHAT
Then I kind of like this.	CHITCHAT
Leg protection stuff.	O
But I want to try to get a little bit of this.	O
Cloth in here in this.	O
I don't know that still work.	CHITCHAT
Just trying to mix in that chair.	O
Take the things they like, kind of, put them together.	O
This guys look super short.	O
I don't know why it looks so short to me when it probably make him taller and Lankier.	O
Think the armor up top.	O
Why'd I just add up top?	O
I think the armor is too dark.	O
Maybe a red will pop.	O
Yeah, the shapes are all super dark.	O
I don't know how much you guys can read the shapes that I'm doing, but I'll definitely have to separate the values of the shapes.	O
Alot of this is just finding the feel of the thing.	O
Like a certain feel and look that I'm going for and once I find that I can kind of correct everything else.	O
Two is too dark.	O
I kind of like it.	O
It's like this really dark kind of Purple E leather.	O
I had a reference, I think somewhere that.	CHITCHAT

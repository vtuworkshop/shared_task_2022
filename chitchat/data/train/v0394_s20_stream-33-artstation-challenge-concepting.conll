That was kind of taken from.	CHITCHAT
But the dark leather looks kind of cool to me.	O
Perhaps it's a bit sinister looking.	O
It's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's quite in the vibe that I'm going for.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you know what?	CHITCHAT
This may be a good time step.	CHITCHAT
To put this on hold though I gotta put a sword on him.	O
I kinda like it.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like this one like this one.	CHITCHAT
This one.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like this one too.	CHITCHAT
I'll come back to this.	CHITCHAT
I gotta I gotta, I put the check mark backwards I gotta rest my eyes on it, yeah.	O
But what I did want to do before we go, which we actually don't have long at all.	CHITCHAT
You got like no, no, we got like.	CHITCHAT
20 minutes, maybe longer than I thought.	CHITCHAT
I think is a started the stream slightly late, so this is the wild character for the art station challenge that I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
If anyone's wondering what this is, if you go to artst.com and you click at the top challenges, it'll bring you to a bunch of challenges called the box of mystery.	O
I'm doing the character one and you're supposed to do 6 characters based off a certain characteristic.	O
And let me pop up my character so I can remember better what they are.	O
Oh yeah, here we go.	CHITCHAT
Serious character, a brave character, joyful Miss Chievous Wild and leader.	O
So the one we're doing right now is wild.	CHITCHAT
He'll probably have this kind of oppose doing something with like like you just landed in throwing some magic down or slashing at people.	O
Yeah, maybe this could even be like a sword in his hand on this one.	O
I'll mess with it.	CHITCHAT
These are these aren't finalized, but that's the idea.	CHITCHAT
These are based off creatures and races that I've created for my worldbuilding project, which is what I've been doing here on be hands for the past couple months or so.	O
It's all been worldbuilding oriented.	O
I'm shifting gears a little bit now into doing this artstation challenge, but it's still based up these no particular characters 'cause I haven't actually developed any characters for my worldbuilding project, but I'll be able to use this project for my worldbuilding if I'd like to so.	O
Yeah, that would be fun to do 'cause it's kind of two birds.	O
One stone.	CHITCHAT
It's not like I'm stopping on the worldbuilding.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so we've done a few of these different characters.	O
None of them are done.	CHITCHAT
You can see these are all just scribbles, but this is the leader character.	O
Some ideas for the mischievous character for the wild character is more of just straight up soldier and then we got.	O
Serious, the series character we have not touched yet.	O
So this is him I thought would be really cool if before the stream ends we throw down some quick ideas.	O
For that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And we're not going to get far on it, but at least just like some of the initial ideas out of my head.	CHITCHAT

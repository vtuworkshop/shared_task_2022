Onto the papers.	O
So next time we jump in, we can kind of.	CHITCHAT
You know, have a starting point that we work from.	CHITCHAT
Let me just check them real quick.	CHITCHAT
Man.	CHITCHAT
A full body suck brilliance.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I gotta get you on the.	CHITCHAT
On the team dev team for this.	CHITCHAT
So let me read about this character real quick.	CHITCHAT
Serious character, they are a scholar and historian of this group, so there was a covenant made hundreds of years ago to protect the second realm.	O
He is the one who knows most about the covenant, the history of the world there in anything about the second realm about the Giants, anything of applicable knowledge he knows about it, probably previous conflicts and all that stuff that has been encountered with the protection of the second realm.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
He's studious, reserved and calm.	O
He has the most knowledge of the mystery of the box of mystery and the ancient texts, so I'm thinking he's wearing robes.	O
Probably a scrolls with him.	O
Lots of layers, multiple books.	O
I was thinking he could be wearing glasses, which could be kind of fun.	O
Yeah, so that's kind of what we're going.	CHITCHAT
This pose is going to be a little less.	O
Intimidating than that one, so here's just him thinking standing upright.	O
This is a little bit more.	O
You know, combat looking not com beverages.	O
Intimidating 'cause He's wider big.	O
Alright, so robes.	O
If I could be the art director.	O
Put a body sock on and call it a day.	O
Let's go home everybody.	CHITCHAT
This is going to be kind of hard to tie like.	CHITCHAT
Designing it shapes but.	CHITCHAT
Like when everything is going to shape.	CHITCHAT
Kind of tough.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually going to put this sketch to decide that helped me with a mischievous character.	O
Maybe it will help with him.	O
Sometimes they could just visualize it a little bit easier.	O
Do picture kind of these.	CHITCHAT
Robe sleeves I think I need a reference of which robes look like when they're just arms are hanging down.	O
Through this type of robe could be like.	O
Sort of jacket.	O
Coat style.	O
So I'm just trying to start with the biggest shapes, 1st and then.	O

A bit of these costume designs today.	O
This is a serious character that I'm just starting now.	O
I'm going to continue working on this tomorrow, and all of these for the rest of the week is the mischievous character.	O
This is the leader.	O
And this is the pose I'm using for them, so still lots to do for the costumes.	O
I'm sure you guys these two but a lot of them are super super rough so I'm going to try to rough these in tomorrow just to get the ideas out there to get the ball rolling a little bit and then we'll have to go through each character and kind of clean them up and find a costume that I really like and then from then on out it's going to be actually doing the finalized character based off the sketches here.	O
So putting that costume that we come up with on this pose that we want to use an just drawing painting until it's finished.	O
There's only like 2 weeks after this until it's do.	O
So it's going to be kind of tough to get in on time.	O
It's due July 13th I believe.	O
So it's going to be tough, but I'm going to do my best so.	CHITCHAT
Will I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We'll get these costumes worked up.	O
To the point that we want and then kind of figure out where to go from there.	O
I may have to leave these costumes really rough and then touch them up at a later date.	O
But You know, I'm probably not going to have time to clean them up and make them all nice and presentable if I actually want to spend time working on the other things, so see how it goes.	O
Let's see what happens, but yeah, these were fun.	CHITCHAT

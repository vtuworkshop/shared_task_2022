How's it going?	CHITCHAT
Today I think what I'm gonna just do is edit this screen right here.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
We're not going to start anything big or major.	CHITCHAT
I started a compass it like a few days ago, but.	CHITCHAT
We're not going to work on that one right now because because yeah, it's just a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Uh, it's pretty big, but I will show you like an example.	CHITCHAT
But this is one that I'm not really working on stream with.	O
Uhm, but um is Gordon here?	CHITCHAT
I'm not 100% sure.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if he is or not, but he could show up.	CHITCHAT
So let me show you the piece that I'm actually working on right now.	O
We're not going to be working on today and Stream.	CHITCHAT
This is kind of like I've already started it and gone like really far so can't go back now.	CHITCHAT
But let's go to the main screen.	O
Alright, so this is kind of like the piece that I'm working on right now.	O
Um, it's kinda cool.	CHITCHAT
It's about Trump.	O
I haven't really done like a Donald Trump piece before or anything to do with politics really.	O
I try and avoid it as much as possible really, but In this sense I don't really mind because there's a lot of things going on in the world right now and I think that my imagery can make a difference.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to attempt to make that difference with these images, but.	O
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
So we're not going to worry about that one right now.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I'm just going to like save it because I don't want to lose it.	CHITCHAT
So let's just say this first.	CHITCHAT
Call Alan Trump.	O
Alright, perfect, that would go and save.	CHITCHAT
All right, So what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to open up my um.	CHITCHAT
Green screen file here.	CHITCHAT
I believe that I had one at one point.	CHITCHAT
Let me just open it.	CHITCHAT
I think it's my streaming template.	CHITCHAT
Oh yes, perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK so I did like the UM back window there so let's just kind of like hide all of this right now.	O
I just think that it's just time to update, upgrade and update and.	O
This is the perfect time to do it, so let me just hide all these.	CHITCHAT
Get rid of lower OK, uhm, lower and upper perfect.	O
So I just want this.	CHITCHAT
And let's see if there's any like cool pixel squid elements that we can bring in here, so pixel squid.	O
I just want to get a desk or something, but like a cooler desk.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
All right, so let's find that desk or something.	O
Actually, we could probably just use like the desk that we had before or.	O
Or what we could possibly do is.	O
We could do something totally different and see if we can put myself in a trash can.	O
OK, so let's do this.	CHITCHAT
To make a new light box and call this stream template.	O
And then we want to go on Adobe stock here.	O
Actually, I might just be able to just get a since it's just for stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to use unsplash I think for this one and I'm just going to park.	O
OK, this isn't too bad, um?	CHITCHAT
I would just like a regular path that would be nice if there was like kind of like a close up.	O
For something to something a lot like this, isn't this is too far zoomed out a little bit?	O
Wait, why a trash bucket?	CHITCHAT
I was calling people yeah so we, uh, so I don't know.	CHITCHAT

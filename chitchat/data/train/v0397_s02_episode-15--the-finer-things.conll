I'm just going to try something new here and I think it's going to be funny so I'm just going to roll with it.	O
How big is this picture?	O
This one actually might work.	CHITCHAT
3000 by 5000 island.	O
Actually, this would actually probably work pretty good.	CHITCHAT
So let's grab this.	CHITCHAT
Actually, the Sky is like not 'cause.	O
I still want the Sky to move.	O
Ah, I see that would've been nice.	CHITCHAT

And I was about to introduce or so to say hi to to Darrin there was like Darren, that's so weird.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I've met Adair before, but makes sense.	CHITCHAT
This one actually doesn't look too bad.	CHITCHAT
Just a lot of cutting.	O

Let's see if we can find something else.	O
We just need to park come on come on is there is let's go to pixels.	O

Actually, this one wouldn't be a.	CHITCHAT
Too bad, let's find like another bin or something then.	O
OK, so this one.	CHITCHAT
This one looks like a little bit.	CHITCHAT
This looks like city right here.	O
So let's add down in there.	O
This is a little bit broken.	O
These are also kind of like these are like the trash bins that we have in like.	O
My area yeah, I know, I know.	CHITCHAT
I just don't call you that Ebony like you know what I call you I call you Ebony everybody calls you Ebony.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see what we can figure out here, um.	CHITCHAT

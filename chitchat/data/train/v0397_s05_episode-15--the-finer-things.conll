That should work.	CHITCHAT
Let's see wine.	O
Breath.	CHITCHAT
And maybe will do this one too, right here.	O
OK, that should work alright, so now I'm just going to add those to my elements here.	O
I'm going to put them underneath everything.	O
I just kind of want to create walls here.	O
Actually, you know it.	CHITCHAT
I think we're just going to add a wall and then just like place windows, I think it's so much easier to do that 'cause we're going to search window.	O
And it gives us a lot of options for this kind of stuff.	O
So we're just going to like redo that wall.	O
What are some nice looking like industrial windows here?	O
Like I don't want anything with the bottom thing right?	O
And these look like house windows.	O
Huh, OK, I think we have to pick one of these ones.	O
AO check the perspective.	O
Yeah, the perspectives aren't right yet.	O
Ebony, I'm just kind of like placing them the pool tables.	O
Like really wonky an it's just 'cause I gotta.	O
I think I have to redo like the flooring too.	O
Actually, I might be able to just find like A.	O
It's 'cause I really want to like.	CHITCHAT
OK, if I go to my green screen, let's go to my green screen for a second.	O
I really want to keep that so like the clouds going in the background.	O
I really like that idea, but it's just like.	CHITCHAT
I need to somehow figure out how to do a window now, like behind me, so I'm going to do a window like here and then the rest is just going to be walls.	O
Like right across so I still have a little bit of that window space, but I just.	O
I don't know, so let's go.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to the mainstage here.	O
I'm just going to see if I could find like an empty room.	O
Actually, you know there's just going to take my chances with Adobe Stock's.	O
It's so much easier just to find things on Adobe Stock then is on any other site.	CHITCHAT
Like if I search empty room, it's going to give me like all empty rooms.	O
See like, why can't it just do this?	O
OK, uhm?	CHITCHAT
So let's see if it'll match the perspective.	O
Actually, this is not too too bad.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to accept this.	CHITCHAT
So let me see if this matches our perspective for a second.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, and then if we go on pixel squid here.	O
Oh yeah, 'cause I rotated it.	O
Just not not matching.	O
I said thing about these 3D elements is out there just like long key.	O
See if I can return it to its perspective.	O
I don't think that that's working.	CHITCHAT

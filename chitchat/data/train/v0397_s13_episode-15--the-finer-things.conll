We were coming from like.	CHITCHAT
You know the countryside, so we said, OK, you know what?	CHITCHAT
It's one night how much damage could socks, possibly due to this empty house, completely empty house?	CHITCHAT
How much damage could a cat do?	CHITCHAT
So we made sure we already thought about it were like K.	CHITCHAT
He's gonna get in this room in this room in this room.	CHITCHAT
So we already blocked off literally all those doors, all those passageways, everything.	CHITCHAT
We literally blocked it off.	CHITCHAT
We put like a bookcase right up against the door opening so that he could not let go around it at all.	CHITCHAT
This He managed to get around the bookcase somehow.	CHITCHAT
Don't know.	CHITCHAT
I still don't know how he got around the bookcase.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
He got up inside the ceiling of the House and it was like, you know it was like ceilings that they have in the school with like all like the panels and everything like that.	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness, it's like he likes stepped on them and like quickly stepped off so that it would fall and he did it like a whole line.	CHITCHAT
There's like probably.	CHITCHAT
Way over I don't like 15 ceiling tiles, all completely fallen down.	CHITCHAT
The whole ceiling was like collapsed everything.	CHITCHAT
And I was like, Oh my God, one night one night away an he managed to get in the ceiling of a house and destroy the ceiling like completely.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea how.	CHITCHAT
No idea how.	CHITCHAT
And then when I brought him to the new house.	CHITCHAT
He uhm, why have delay?	CHITCHAT
You aren't playing games to people ghosting.	CHITCHAT
Delay what do you mean delay?	CHITCHAT
I'm not, I'm not a.	CHITCHAT
There's probably a little bit of a delay on the stream like it's probably like like.	CHITCHAT
Like 20 seconds or something.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty long.	CHITCHAT
But I will get to like some of the comments and stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to keep going, but but yeah, there's a second time where, uhm?	CHITCHAT
We allowed him in the new house and everything like that and then we didn't block off one room and then he ended up getting inside the wall.	CHITCHAT
So he was like adventuring around the walls of the house and.	CHITCHAT
I don't know man, it's uh.	CHITCHAT
Socks is a crazy cat.	CHITCHAT
Crazy crazy cat.	CHITCHAT
That's going to be smaller.	O
I'm going to change this.	O
With that Perfect, OK, now I'm going to.	O
I'm going to start blending so this table.	O
Let's see this table first.	O
And K.	O
Clip mask OK, I'm just going to do the highlights.	O
Yeah, there's.	CHITCHAT
There's just a stream delay.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how long the stream delay is, but there's always a delay with streams and I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think it's just because the software that I'm I'm using two at the same time.	CHITCHAT
And it's going to do overlay here.	O
OK, that doesn't look too too too too bad.	CHITCHAT

Welcome to my bar.	O
Would anybody like anything to?	CHITCHAT
Would anybody like anything in the bar today?	O
It's all on me and we just opened.	CHITCHAT
We look at we are fully operating bar online.	O
This looks kinda cool though, right?	O
Like managing my own bar.	CHITCHAT
Yes, we have a lot of choices today.	CHITCHAT
We could go out here.	CHITCHAT
Let me grab.	CHITCHAT
I wish I could like grab elements here.	O
Have a coffee.	O
We make coffee here too.	O
It's hard because I have to like.	O
Like slightly like Ben down like this.	O
At like Neil down here, I'm going to kneel it.	O
OK, I'm going to kneel and I'm going to just make my green screen like a little bit bigger.	O
No, you can't do that.	CHITCHAT
I have to like literally.	CHITCHAT
Get like this.	CHITCHAT
OK, perfect.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the bar welcome.	O
So what are y'all think?	CHITCHAT
But how do you like?	CHITCHAT
My bar is pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
I like I'm just chilling out in here to sound good time I don't I can't like necessarily walk outside of the bar.	O
Is it like?	CHITCHAT
Gets rid of it, but like if I get a whole green screen room then like stuff like this would actually work pretty good.	O
And you can like kind of make your own scenes and like and like movies and stuff like that, right?	O
But I don't have a a wide screen webcam so I can't really like.	O
I can't really like do anything right.	CHITCHAT
I can't like make it so that I can walk out there, but.	O
Pretty soon I mean like I can try and do like other like other stuff.	CHITCHAT
Uh, with it, but I just need to like a whole room basically as like a green screen.	O
Which will I'll probably get there, but.	CHITCHAT
But for now this is kind of cool, right?	CHITCHAT
Like I would need something to like lean on, like I don't know if I have like.	O
I guess I can.	CHITCHAT
Use this like stool.	O
Then I have here.	CHITCHAT
Going to lay down.	O
And put money on it.	O
Might not work actually.	O
Yes it does.	O
I hope.	CHITCHAT
There we go perfect.	CHITCHAT
Magnus, like.	CHITCHAT
Manage the bar and everything.	O
And yes, I very big Hanson think that I was gonna stream my own bar.	O
Are you even think that?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, but the godfather, Sean night.	CHITCHAT
But, uh, but yeah, so there's people.	CHITCHAT
There's people socializing in here like you know there.	O
There Hannah good time and I don't know we might.	CHITCHAT
We might use this scene.	O
I'll probably set up one like.	CHITCHAT
You know later something that we could mess around with and then we can start doing like stuff like this where I'm just kind of like editing the scene for you and then.	CHITCHAT
Throwing it in the obvious here, obviously you have some like smaller details like like if you look down below like the shadowing to the counter here like it's not correct 'cause I don't know why it added like the white line around it at the figure out what that is.	O
But but it's pretty good.	CHITCHAT
It's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
I would have to probably put like A.	O
Like a shadow overlay or something in in the corner over here so that it kind of goes over top of me.	O
But Yeah, my stand back here though.	O
It kinda I can probably bring it up actually late Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's go bring this down.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Very now I look like unproportionate to like.	CHITCHAT
The actual thing is a lot of lights on me now.	O
It's really bright.	CHITCHAT
But but yeah, so that's a That's a fun little.	O
Fun little stream?	CHITCHAT

Yeah, forgot were going places.	CHITCHAT
But I want to be here.	CHITCHAT
You want to be here?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let me grab your let me grab your beer.	O
Uhm, let me just let me just reached under the counter here.	O
Up, let's say we don't have beer, but we do have coffee underneath the counter here.	O
So if you want coffee then we got it already mugged too.	O
For you got it pretty mugged.	CHITCHAT

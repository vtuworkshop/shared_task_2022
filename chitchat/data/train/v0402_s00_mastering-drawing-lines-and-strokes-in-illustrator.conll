Alright, hello everyone, I'm going to see you here.	CHITCHAT
Paul with a semi transparent shirt going to dive into just sort of mastering line work which is really important in illustrator and Luckily for you I guess I'm going to give you a quick preview of illustrator on the iPad and then will transfer over to the desktop but feel free to say hello.	O
Good to see you here.	CHITCHAT
Ali Giga.	CHITCHAT
I'll Marcelo Shabaan.	CHITCHAT
E Katrina awesome people from all over Anaheim in the house.	CHITCHAT
I'm here in beautiful Denver, Co.	CHITCHAT
It's sunny out is a gorgeous day.	CHITCHAT
It's a good day to be inside working on the computer.	CHITCHAT
All right, but the cool thing is, you know, and this is coming soon.	CHITCHAT
But when you have, let's switch over here a iPad and this is coming.	CHITCHAT
Soon you'll be able to kind of use illustrator on the iPad, 'cause that's what I've actually been doing.	CHITCHAT
A lot of just to be honest with you, if you've already kind of created some of this, I can't finish this out and what I'm going to be using on the desktop also are these same tools kind of get familiar with it?	CHITCHAT
Good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
Holy yeah, anuja.	CHITCHAT
Magda Victor one awesome, so let's dive into this and again, I typically have just use this pencil like as I draw.	O
Look how it just kind of creates this line and maybe I can turn off some of that.	O
Her right.	O
In fact, all kind of draw a little bit jupp like that and then I'll pick up that line as well and draw a little bit more.	O
So let me just kind of come in here.	O
And continue that line.	O
Also notice how I have all these various points that we can deal with.	O
You can double tap and then convert that to these bezier points and start to get these curves just right.	O
But again, like I said, I typically end up using just the pencil.	O
So let's get that like so.	O
It's kind of continue that down like that.	O
And I don't have to get it perfect right now, but I'm just going to modify this line so I messed it up on purpose.	O
OK, we get it.	CHITCHAT
Jewel, what are you doing?	CHITCHAT
What are you promoting?	CHITCHAT
Joel, come on now.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to zoom in here.	O
This is the line I'm working on again.	O
Just double tapping, double tapping on each one of those.	O
I don't need that many points right?	O
Right in here I can actually remove that point like so.	O
Jumping in here, removing that point as well so I can kind of get this the way I want it to look.	O
And let's actually working on a little bit of these.	O
These points right down here.	O
And again I want to add some.	CHITCHAT
I can add a point right there just by using the pen tool.	O
I don't need an additional tool to add that point, but I'll start to just kind of angle that out like so, and then we'll get this on my desktop 'cause I don't want to spend a lot of time here just to be honest with you, but I thought it would be fun to show just for a quick second.	O
Further knows will jump in kind of draw that down like that.	O
Let's do the curve on the inside of the nose and then the outside right again the same.	O
Goal is to jump in and take these lines and adjust accordingly now.	O
Let me jump down.	O
I'm not seeing all the comments, apologize for that.	CHITCHAT
Let's jump down there we go.	O
Has it been released left yet?	O
It has not.	O
No were still working on it.	CHITCHAT
OK, but the whole idea of being able to remove a point without sort of changing the stroke of the line is the goal.	O
So some of these all like kind of have an issue with right?	O
That will clean up on the desktop.	O
Let's just kind of do the lips really fast.	O
Still using the pencil right?	O
Coming in here.	CHITCHAT
Zip.	O
Right, I want to change it.	O
A little bit, let's undo that.	O
Let's go back in here.	O
And draw like so.	CHITCHAT
Kind of get the lips go in like so OK and guess what?	O
Will flip those.	O
Add a color right in here of course is going to be read for the lips and start to modify these individual points.	O

Whether I would have done in this with the pencil or just started with the pen I probably would have actually used the pen in this case because I'd want to get a little bit more exact.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
But let's just make those lips just like that.	O
In this case.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm gonna move on.	CHITCHAT
Let's hurry up and, kind of.	CHITCHAT
Finish this out.	CHITCHAT
Draw the lower half.	O
When it comes to lips, usually the bottom lip is going to be a little lighter.	O
OK, because your top lip usually casts a shadow, so you want to have that.	O
Bottom lip more lights going to be hitting it, so it's going to be a little bit brighter so we can adjust it like so like I'm doing right now and it's kind of up to me to determine how much detail I want in this whole piece, so that's what we'll do there it is, right?	O
I can go ahead and send this to my desktop, right?	O
And I'll switch over to my desktop and you can see kind of the version that I actually worked on earlier.	O
Let's go right here.	CHITCHAT
Wait for it.	CHITCHAT
Vampyrum Dario OK.	CHITCHAT
Cool uh good to hear from Bangladesh.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to audit.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, exactly Christopher.	CHITCHAT
You don't want it, so this is what we want to do.	O
Like we don't want to change the lines right like it was doing there a second ago and that's why I want to talk about these lines.	O
So right in here, even if I wanted to redraw these, let's just go ahead and take these lines.	O
And in this case I'll just take these two.	O
And I will just make them just a light Gray.	O
OK, that's essentially all I'm doing, and I'll add a layer.	O
So if I actually wanted to redraw these right the pencil on the desktop.	O
If I double click on the pencil tool will have these options, right?	O
So we can make this as accurate or as smooth as we want.	O
It was doing a lot of redrawing there to be honest with you.	O
I'll oftentimes do smooth, right, right in here.	O
We want to keep it selected and the option key can toggle.	O
To the smooth tools I'll end up using that a lot, right?	O
Also edit selected pads, right?	O
That's going to be really helpful and you can adjust within what range are editing.	O
Those pixels will click OK.	O
You know we can come in here and we can start to draw with this set to smooth.	O
I can come in and even though I'm using a mouse right, I can draw out that line.	O
It it actually is pretty smooth for the most part, right?	O
I'm able to draw out that line even if I wanted to trace this part.	O
Right, I'm going to have that smooth line like so coming back over this way I can get that smooth line as well, so that's what I'll typically do.	O
I'll draw with the pencil tool set to smooth.	O
Right and you would get something like this and let's go back.	O
This is what most of the lines look like.	O
In fact, most of the lines don't even have a rounded cap like right in here.	O
what I will typically do is jump in and then round the cap on the end and then round the corners right?	O
So we're going to get some nice smooth lines.	O
Another thing I'll do is I'll come in and I just turn this off before smoothing out in.	O
This knows 'cause we want this to look really elegant, right?	O
We don't want it to look too ridiculous.	O
So I would typically extend this line down for this particular illustration, and I would for this line change the width profile right up here at the top right.	O
So change the width profile to write down here with profile four, OK will select that hello man stuff from Italy.	O
Subway excuse me from.	O
Matt Manisha from India sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Uh, watching from the pool, so that's what we want.	CHITCHAT
We want these elegant strokes, right?	O
'cause I'm kind of doing a uh, what is it?	CHITCHAT
What is his name?	CHITCHAT
I'm drawing a blank.	CHITCHAT
The 80s artist that did a lot of these pictures where it's just red lips and black hair.	O
That's ultimately what I'm going for.	O
I can't think of the guys name and I feel terrible, but we can think enough that line like we're doing right now take this one as well.	O
Will do the same thing right?	CHITCHAT
Will make that end pointing like so, thinking that up like that, OK?	O
So far so good.	CHITCHAT
Same thing for this line right here.	O
We will change the width profile to slowly get thinner as it goes to this side and increase the size like a just a touch right?	O
So we get more motion right in there.	O
So if I want to go for that look, sorry actually already did some of this work so let's just turn off those.	CHITCHAT
Those eyebrows, but if you're drawing everything the same direction.	O
Like I was doing here, I was drawing everything.	O

The sort of the length of the eyebrows, like each little her.	O
Then we can come in and change the width profile.	O
There are times where it actually might not go that direction and I'll show you so, Patrick Patrick Night Nagel Oh thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Dennis Patrick Nagel.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
It was his artwork was like really big at the fair like if you went to the fair and you could potentially win one of his posters like a poster of his artwork which was pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
And this is what it looks like.	CHITCHAT
It was actually more solid colors, right?	O
We have more lines that we can add like I had more lines for the eyes, but for his work you want to go in and start simplifying and it's like artists say you know it's not when there's anything more than you can add, but it's when there's nothing more you can take away.	O
So that's what I did here.	CHITCHAT
It's like I was trying to take away things to make it look better.	CHITCHAT
An already it's looking better, so let's move on.	CHITCHAT
What's up greetings from Pakistan up.	CHITCHAT
Good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
So this looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
We have these lips that looks good like so.	O
Let's get into this.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm actually going to take this her right here.	O
We have all this hair right?	O
And for this her I'm just going to duplicate it like so.	O
I actually want to make this her solid so there's a couple different ways we could do that.	O
OK, we needed to cover Duran Duran's album.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I love it.	CHITCHAT
That's what I want this to look like.	O
I'm going to make the hair solid.	O
We're going to add a background and we're just going to learn how to control lines.	O
So that's what I'm going to do right now.	O
In lock down everything else I'm working with the hair right couple different ways we could do this.	CHITCHAT
I can still use the pencil tool by the way, and again I could use the pen to or as well, but I'm going to select everything, command a select all and we see when we roll over a line, right?	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
As we see right up here, it will actually continue that line if I want to write, I can redraw this line from here if I want to down like that.	O
So that's how you want to control these lines when you're drawing specially for this hair, I can continue that line like so.	O
I'll select everything, maybe I'll kind of have actually come down now I want to connect these two right like this will select everything, right?	O
I'll come to this line and connect the two like that.	O
Band connected, selecting everything.	O
Maybe I want to connect these.	O
Honestly, I'd probably just go through like that.	O
And draw that around and connect it to that one down there, right?	O
Drawing a little bit more.	O
Selecting everything again just actually let's.	O
Make sure.	CHITCHAT
Sounds like so.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just going to draw this down, connect it right back there.	O
I'm just making one big unified shape.	O
Another way we could do this is we could actually use the blob brush.	O
Blah brush will allow us to do that as well.	O
I actually wanted the curves to be exact and kind of mirror the hair.	O
That's why I'm actually using this side connect this like that.	O
I'm going to do this really fast again, just connecting lines 'cause that's in my options for my pencil, connecting them, connecting them like that.	O
Right in like so.	CHITCHAT
And maybe this works for you.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you'll do it a different way.	CHITCHAT
Guess what?	CHITCHAT
That's the great thing about art.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if there's any wrong way, right?	CHITCHAT
No, there's wrong way.	CHITCHAT
I'd say as long as the client is happy.	CHITCHAT
You know it doesn't really matter how you get it done, right?	CHITCHAT
Again, the BLOB brush would be another option.	O
The blob brush might be a good option.	O
When I start to draw the face 'cause I'm going to fill this in, it's all going to be black hair, but then we need to worry about her.	O
Her face, which is going to be black unless we do something about it.	O
Alright, so let's just go like that.	CHITCHAT
Just bring it up right?	CHITCHAT
You get it.	CHITCHAT
You get the idea.	CHITCHAT
Let's connect this to there and here we have like her hair, right?	O
That's how I would connect all those lines, right?	O
Alright, so again, I just kind of recap.	CHITCHAT
If you are just joining me I want to say hello and welcome and I hope you're well and safe in your just doing.	CHITCHAT
Well that's all you know life's life stressful.	CHITCHAT
You know illustrator shouldn't be, and that's why I like the fact that you have all these options to customize the tools as you click right in here again, that's set to smooth, and that's what I was doing, is just keeping it selected and editing those selected path.	O
So that's the tip there, right?	O
Coming back out.	O
I would do the same thing.	CHITCHAT
We could do the same thing with the with the hair and let's take this down here like that.	O
Guess what this line right here?	O
Let's fill it with white like so, so that's what we can do right there and we can add more to it as well.	O

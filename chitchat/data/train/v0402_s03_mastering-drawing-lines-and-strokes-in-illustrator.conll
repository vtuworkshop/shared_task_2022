Hello from Panama Man, I man I remember when I used to travel for a living, so much fun.	CHITCHAT
I remember going to Panama actually went to Panama just for fun along time ago.	CHITCHAT
'cause it is a cool place, right?	CHITCHAT
Right up here will just draw this down.	O
Again, I'm just using the pencil because I'm lazy.	O
Right anytime we have 2 points and say for instance, if these weren't connected by the way right.	O
So we can come in and we could disconnect him right.	O
I can go ahead and cut this take that point.	O
Let's delete it right.	O
We could always join these 2 points and that's when you get into a lot of these additional tools under object path.	O
This is going to be your next best friend taking things to the next level when it comes to lines and strokes and stuff, but right here command J.	CHITCHAT
Been in here for I've been using it for like 20 years but we can go ahead and connect those lines.	O
So now we have a solid white kind of going all the way around if we want that right?	O
So that's what I'm all I'm doing right there.	O
Cool, let's move on.	CHITCHAT
Move that down.	CHITCHAT
Move that down.	O
Take a look at this same process.	O
Bring this in.	O
I probably want to kind of maybe cut that so it doesn't frame her face too much, but that's OK.	O
I'm going to just try to do this as fast as I can and try to make it look as good as it can.	CHITCHAT
In a short amount of time, let me know if you have questions.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I have plenty of tips for you, but this is like me, just like creating artwork.	CHITCHAT
So I think it's good to kind of jump in and just watch somebody create artwork.	CHITCHAT
Essentially is all I'm doing right in here.	CHITCHAT
We can control the thickness as well, so we could have this.	O
We use these width profiles all day long, right?	O
We can go like that and have it make it thick and thin, right?	O
Like we see there or we could even use right over here the width tool so you have a tool that does that as well.	O
Selecting the width tool going to that line.	O
Right in here and now I can make it may be thicker there an then thinner down here, right?	O
Controlling Its thickness based on whatever part that I want, right?	O
So I get those nice elegant curves.	O
Is what I'm going for case elderly that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
Hope you have a good day everybody.	CHITCHAT
Uh, never even thought of that.	CHITCHAT
OK I love the width tool.	O
Love it by the way with the width tool you can come in, you can use the width tool you know at it make it stick right there.	O
You can grab one side and hold down the option key and you can.	O
Kind of make that say 1 sided right?	O
So it's only going to have that width on one side of this line.	O
If I want to write in here, the next question is why is it round here?	O
How can we get rid of this roundness?	O
Well again, that's right in here with the stroke.	O
Sorry if that's hard to see, but will zoom in here and will change the cat.	O
It's the butt cap.	O
Apparently had no idea was called that the butt Cap Move, Giggle, Giggle about that, Huh?	CHITCHAT
But then we have it.	CHITCHAT
We take that.	CHITCHAT
Obviously it's at a different angle.	O
We we just that Bezier if we want to and we can connect it kind of like that.	O
As you can see like.	CHITCHAT
So cool.	CHITCHAT
For this end I'd make it sharp so again I would just grab my width tool and make it sharp on that end like that but for the most part I just end up using these with profiles 'cause it's so much easier.	O
Honestly I don't have to worry about.	CHITCHAT
You know creating my own width profiles, but it's there when I need it, which is pretty awesome, right?	CHITCHAT
So we kind of do that.	CHITCHAT
Her ear looks ridiculous, will refine that later, actually need some more points as well, but it's kind of bring that up and make it look a little bit more elegant yet us.	O
It's just not as big as her head.	O
Because currently that's kind of what's happening.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Take this part and bring it up like that.	O
Alright cool, OK we do the same thing for her whole head.	O
Let me just jump in here.	O
Let's add a few more points right in here really fast.	O
Grabbing is bringing it down.	O
We need to add a nice little part to her hair, so P for Penn, Right?	O
We don't need to go to like the ad anchor point tool, right?	O
Will just roll over that line right?	O
Over here and we want to add a point.	O
Boom, we can add a point like I did right here.	O
OK so there's my intersecting point right?	O
I can add another one right here if I think I need it right.	O
Will hit a for direct selection grab that will move it up.	O
Guess what?	CHITCHAT
Shift C if you're on A.	O
A Mac, I think it works the same on the PC.	O
Double click or just click on it once actually, but that allows you to modify that anchor point like I'm doing right now and that's the essentially right over here.	O

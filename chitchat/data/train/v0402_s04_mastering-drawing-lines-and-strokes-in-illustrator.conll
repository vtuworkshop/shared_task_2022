Shift C.	O
The anchor point tool.	O
So those are the shortcuts you should be using as you get into illustrator, right?	O
Hit a again and jump in and move that like so as I start to play with this little part like that.	O
Alright hello.	CHITCHAT
Remember point a right here.	O
This part I want to smooth this corner out just a little bit, OK?	O
So right down here you get this little control point which will round that just ever so slightly and actually split that into two 'cause all I want is kind of like a soft little curve right there, and I could.	O
I could play with that more, make that as drastic or as subtle as I want, but again, I have that sort of control.	O
Maybe I'll remove that point.	O
Less is always going to be more.	O
As we can see, like that command zero boom there we are.	O
Let's move on to even the final.	O
Actually I don't know if you guys want to see the final that I was working on.	O
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Cool, let's let's move on to this.	CHITCHAT
I need to get into more more things, more stuff, right?	CHITCHAT
Ultimately, for this I would add a background, right?	O
Jumping in here.	O
Picking a nice blue for instance, and I'll show you the problem that will have as I draw this out.	O
Of course, it's you notice all these other parts that are white that need to be joined as well.	O
So again, that means just connecting these lines as well.	O
So right in here.	CHITCHAT
I would jump in, select this line, select this line, pry copy it, paste it, and I would actually have a new layer.	O
By the way, this is how I do things that's called our fill color for skin, right?	O
That's what I'd call it, so I'd have my body lines, but then I'd had my fill color for the skin, right?	O
Turning that off, zooming back out.	O
I can use the pen tool the same way I use the pencil tool.	O
Come in and let me actually turn on this again.	O
Like that will go up.	O
Like that back down over command A.	O
Let's almost.	CHITCHAT
Go lock all those lovely things.	O
There it is right anchor point.	O
And connect those two.	O
Right there, so let me zoom in on that a little closer.	O
In some cases I might be able to use join right in here, but it's not going to close a lot of these gaps if they're really thick.	O
By the way, there's a large distance, right?	O
So again, it's just a matter of again, even using the pencil, drawing that line and connecting them like that.	O
OK, with that done, let's go ahead and flip that.	O
Make this white and be well on our way for our lovely picture that we're working on.	O
OK, so that's what we're going for.	O
This is kind of where it into that, right?	O
Just so you know what happens in here?	O
A lot of this stuff that we've just already learned for these strokes.	O
Well, hey, let's take these hair strands.	O
Right and you can see these hair strands are done with that with profile.	O
If not the width tool to come in and add this like a nice highlight right there, like I did in this case, right?	O
So that's what I'm going for here.	CHITCHAT
I think it's like simple enough.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if there's a lot I don't know if it actually looks better with her hair with those hair strands or without it, but that's the short of what I was doing for this particular piece, right?	O
Um and again I think your goal as you mature as a designer is to use less effects.	O
You really start editing is what it comes down at least for me.	O
'cause again, a lot of times I'll go overboard with things and then I gotta scale it back.	CHITCHAT
And it's like turning off a layer.	CHITCHAT
Does it look better this way or without it?	CHITCHAT
Are these strands too strong?	O
Is it too much of a highlight, right?	O
Well, we can go in and select one of those and then we could do a select the same right over here.	O
You Select the same stroke color fam.	O
There it is.	CHITCHAT
It'll select that same stroke color or stroke width and then I can change the color 'cause maybe it needs to be just like a little bit darker.	O
So let's just go with a Gray and that helps out actually a lot more.	O
Would you agree Dan?	CHITCHAT

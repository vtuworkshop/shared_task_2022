Uh, Yes.	CHITCHAT
Dan is on the same page I looked over.	CHITCHAT
I saw Dan Flores is like hey it looks good but you need to tone it down.	CHITCHAT
Paul chill, chill it out a little bit, right?	CHITCHAT
Another thing you could do in these cases right is come in and what I'd also try is if you want some uniformity with some of these, you could take this strand.	O
You could take draw another one as well.	O
Here's another line and then you could.	O
Potentially if you want big.	O
Fun curls.	O
You can use the blend tool so I can select both of these.	O
Come over here.	O
Here's the blend tool off to the side.	O
Again, it's been in illustrator since illustrator 88.	O
Believe it or not, trust me I have it on my laptop.	CHITCHAT
Click right there and we just had done a blend of three, but this gives us control as we go in here we can say hey you know what specified steps specified steps of four right now I can grab this coming here, grab this one for instance.	O
Right and move this out in this case.	O
Like I'm doing right now, right?	CHITCHAT
And this could be.	CHITCHAT
What I can do for her four part over here if I wanted to give it more like volume if you will.	O
OK yeah, I agree better less less is more in this case.	O
Can we all agree less is more?	CHITCHAT
Less is a good thing.	CHITCHAT
That's why I'm glad we all agree we could take these.	CHITCHAT
Like damn said, you can even play with the opacity.	CHITCHAT
I just made it Gray, but I think it's just like a little bit more subtle.	O
And typically what you do with her as you block it out so you do it based on the highlights rather than strands.	O
You don't draw your drawing like blocks like shapes as opposed to the actual hair.	O
So the hair is something I'll work on.	O
I'll get more into that later, but I wanted to kinda talk about, you know.	CHITCHAT
Working and mastering lines and strokes and stuff like that Jamie from Dubai.	O
Awesome.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you tuned in as well maranda, so that's it for this.	CHITCHAT
I could play with this more, but I think it's at a good place and.	CHITCHAT
I guess I'll post it on social media when I'm done.	CHITCHAT
So as I work on the her some more I'll post to social media and I want to thank you guys just for hanging out with me as I get this all squared away and again I would talk about blocking that might take a little bit longer but I guess I'll just end with real quick.	O
The blob brush because if I did do any blocking.	O
I would come in and use the blob brush tool right over here.	O
There it is blah brush bam, there it is and then it's just like adding a highlights right up here right and then giving it shape right?	O
So what did I just do I created this shape right here, right?	O
I'd want to actually make this look a little bit more smooth.	O
I'd go into object path.	O
This is brand new by the way.	CHITCHAT
Right in here simplify.	O
Click right there you get this little HUD if you will just like heads up display just pops up right on the object and then you can make it.	O
Remove a lot of the points or add more points and the auto will actually put it kind of right in this area as my experience, but you can give it like less points 'cause in this case I want less points so I can control it a little easier and then you don't have to hit OK or anything 'cause a lot of people will hit OK and it will bring up a different dialogue.	O
Just it's done right?	CHITCHAT
So then you go in, you use your selection tool.	O
You add your highlights where you need to write anyway.	O
Have 1000 other tips but I'm getting ahead of myself.	CHITCHAT
I'm not even saying this is the right approach right now, but trust me I will try things.	CHITCHAT
It will get uglier before it gets better, but now you know how I'd probably do the blocking if I do that.	CHITCHAT
So Alright, Yes, block brushes, just like drawing, guess what blob brush is in illustrator on the iPad, which is not released yet, but I'm super excited about it and I'm just happy guys join me today.	O
Yeah, you could probably me or whatever.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
You can send me a message.	CHITCHAT
Also send me a message on all the social medias as well and I will be happy to.	CHITCHAT
Get to any of your questions if you have any that would be great.	CHITCHAT
I would appreciate to and would like to keep the conversation going right so there we are.	CHITCHAT
There's a big pool mean, an illustrator and character animator, but that's my social media so we could talk alright.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Francisco.	CHITCHAT
And everybody I'm going to let you go and be respectful of your time.	CHITCHAT
Be safe, everybody really appreciate you.	CHITCHAT
Give somebody a virtual hug, tell them their hair looks good.	CHITCHAT
Even though it looks kind of stringing like hers, but thanks so much everybody will be in touch soon.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT

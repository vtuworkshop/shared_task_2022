And if you do have suggestions on what I should do, you make comment in the comment section to give your ideas and thoughts on what this art piece should be.	CHITCHAT
OK, now that's done.	CHITCHAT
We're going to bring down the size a little bit, but the flow.	O
Can I put a Galaxy and angle?	O
Right here, so we're going to start making.	O
Kind of swirl.	O
Start making it very thin, Oval.	O
Make a nice spiral.	O
Sure, it goes off the edges.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Now the code we're going to be using our.	O
Abstract colors we're going to be using some blueish purplish little bit pinkish colors so that we're going to be doing.	O
We're going to go back to the FX section and go to the cloud soft.	O
There, and we're going to be selecting our colors.	O
Bring it down to a little bit of a purple Hue.	O
Very lightly just brush on the edge to it too small there or bring up the size.	O
Very gently.	O
Bring along side you know we don't want too much what's going to overdo the effect.	O
Most the clouds reached out a little bit of the effect that this is a spiral Galaxy.	O
Now going to bring up a little bit more lighter colors.	O
Bring up the size, but pulling down the flow a little bit.	O
See how it makes more depth into the whole aesthetic of it.	O
Kind of leave the middle bit blank is that we're going to be putting the black hole.	O
Right here alright, give it that nice effect.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to be going into the dusty.	O
The dusty pen and it could be bringing it a little bit all the way to an orange.	O
You bring it down.	O
Sort of kind of brushing it along.	O
Supposed to give it the death that's looking for and starts giving it those tiny minute details that we need when we're making sort of Spacey kind of field look kind of fresh it along.	O
I'm going to get.	CHITCHAT
To make it a little bit.	O
Look up dark shoe.	O
Again, doing that.	O
And more depth to it and showing.	O
But this really does look like.	O
They're going to be adding some white to it too.	O
Just a very little bit.	O
Don't want much.	O
Now there's another Galaxy is already looking very, very good.	O
Now I'm going to be going to clouds scattered, and we're going to be very.	O
Very carefully.	O
Brushing alongside.	O
Probably too much there.	O
Very carefully.	O
Easily Russian alongside.	O
Be very careful with your movements because you don't want to put too much like I did there.	O
Be very precise, right?	O
A little bridge in your strokes and curves.	O
Don't bring it down a little bit.	O
Bring down the largeness of it.	O
Bring it around.	O
We can see how this pops out a little bit too much.	O
There's a way to fix that.	O
What we can do is that we can take.	O
Is that we can take our.	CHITCHAT
Eyedropper we could find the color they were looking for.	O
Will build that dark issue going to be kind of.	O

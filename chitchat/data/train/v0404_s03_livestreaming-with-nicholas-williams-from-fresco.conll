Carefully going over each and every one of them.	O
It would seem as if it was.	O
The clouds were mingled with the others.	O
Make make the other clouds apart of it.	O
Don't make him stick out.	O
Show like that perfect.	O
Right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go back over again to the different ones that I talked about.	O
We doing it with some of these given it more that field.	O
We going back to that orange color.	O
I'm going back to that white color.	O
I'm going to be showing.	O
Looks.	CHITCHAT
It's already looking stellar.	O
Now to finish off the outer edges of it, going to get the star scape.	O
Very lightly.	O
Push alongside it.	O
Skip that affect their stars in this system.	O
You look closely, can actually see the shapes of reflecting.	O
As you can see, that is practically very close to being done or it's going to add a couple of effects on it and add some clouds scattered.	O
Going to get a blue color.	O
We gotta be very careful on this blue 'cause we don't want it too much.	O
So going to turn down that.	O
Gonna just brush it very carefully.	O
Very lightly.	O
Some depth to it covered.	O
You can see the color is becoming much more vibrant 'cause the Blue is being layered layered on top of them.	O
Put it on the rims 2 to kind of give it that fadeaway effect.	O
It's already looking very, very good.	O
All right, now we're going to start making the black hole.	O
She wanna get your shapes.	O
Going to shrink this down.	O
We're going to do is ever going to make it very?	O
Very small.	O
And Anglet.	O
Alongside with this.	O
Perfect look at that.	CHITCHAT
Perfect shape.	O
Now we can select a variety of colors.	O
So we can pick.	O
Of course we pick blue would be a little bit of a purple, maybe even a little bit of Orange, but we're going to do here.	O
Is going to pick a little bit.	O
The purple to remit.	O
But it's going to be a little bit of light purple.	O
Little bit of a lattice, so we're going to be going up a little bit.	O
This blue.	O
And see how that looks.	O
We're going to fill that.	O
Now it may look quite ugly at the time, but.	O
It's actually quite good when it comes to this.	O
You want to zoom in.	O
So you can really see what you're looking at here.	O
Going to open this up a little bit more.	O
And perfect, so we're going to get a black color.	O
I'm going to fill that.	O
Boom, now going to zoom back out.	O
We're going to deselect that.	O
Let's move this picture a little more of the right.	O
I'm going to start putting affects under the black hole.	O
First, we're going to do clouds, scattered check, and we're going to be getting a nice little blue color.	O
Nice blue color, very light.	O
Resume on in.	O
Start roaming the Edginess.	O
See a little bit of blue.	O
You want to put too much.	O
Oppression is very gently.	O
Little bit on the inward too.	O
K now gives it that private Hue of the changing colors and bring it to a nice purple pinkish purple will not.	O
Let me get the same there.	O
Very gently, very lightly.	O
Press the edges.	O
Now you might want to go a little bit in depth with it.	O
You can see what I'm doing here.	O
Make sure it blends with the outer end of the Galaxy you don't want it to make it look like an abstract material inside this.	O

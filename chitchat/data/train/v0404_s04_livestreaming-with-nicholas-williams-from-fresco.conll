That would not look too pretty.	O
Get some nice little.	O
Circling affects there we go.	O
So now we're going to white.	O
Do the same thing again.	O
Layering layer upon layer, make it make it with the effect with it.	O
There we go looking good looking swell.	O
Now I'm going to be getting our purple again.	O
Are nice little purple.	O
Be praying that in.	O
Instead, doing clouds scattered into cloudsoft.	O
See, we cut into the.	O
Blackholed every do not want to do that.	O
There we go.	O
So here's what we're going to do next, so let's zoom out a little bit.	O
Started looking good.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be kind of selecting on how we're going to make this black hole really blended, 'cause it still.	O
It's still kind of.	O
Uhm, it's still look looking like an abstract sort of thing so.	O
Here's what we're gonna do.	O
We're going to find something that really.	O
Brings it through.	O
Towards the others, so I'm going to be bringing it down.	O
Using the splatter.	O
So the blending in.	O
Can be taking.	O
This and bring that in.	O
Could be covering that.	O
Making it really, really well.	O
Now we're going to be.	O
Blending even more clouds with it.	O
Add soft.	O
Giving it that bright color.	O
Next, a little bit around.	O
I want too much.	O
You want too little.	O
Bring down the size.	O
Really close into it.	O
Beating are.	O
Little bit of a darker color, bringing it down quite a bit.	O
Be coloring the inner edges of the event Horizon of it.	O
Who is trying to blend those colors in?	O
Never be taking some white.	O
Wish her to finish it off.	O
I think some.	O
Highlight two at all.	O
Bring it up a little bit.	O
Here we go.	O
All right?	O
Now we're going to be taking.	O
Some other colors going back to the color wheel.	O
It's going to cover this way little too much there.	O
There.	O
To refreshing office of some stars from the scattered a little bit going to scatter that around it.	O
Fix it up getting some white doing that as well, given the effect that there's small stars going back and we're going to be bringing out.	O
These star scape.	O
Do not to cross it a little bit.	O
So you can see there.	O
I want we zoom back out.	O
Boom, it looks like the black hole is actually a part of it.	O
It looks like the Galaxy was made around it, so you gotta make sure they blended in and it's looking absolutely swell.	O
So that is the finisher for that.	O
For that area where we're going to do is, we're going to brush lightly up against the edges of it to finish it off.	O
And boom, just like that, you made yourself a beautiful little Galaxy.	O
Next We're going to do.	O
Is that we are going to?	O
Fix this square circle boom.	O

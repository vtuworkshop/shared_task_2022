OK.	CHITCHAT
So now we're going to be making our planet.	O
Just like so right there, alright?	O
So here's how we're going to be doing this.	O
Could be having like it's going to be having some reflections off of the black hole of the light that it admits.	O
So here's what we're going to be doing.	O
We're going to be selecting this.	O
I'm going to be feeling this with black.	O
This will be selling with white.	O
So you know we're looking poops little bit too much.	O
There look at that OK.	CHITCHAT
So we know what we're working with here.	O
That's the planet that we're going to be working on.	O
So we can make it to a gas giant.	O
We can make it into a regular planet.	O
What we could do is we could work on a gas giant for now because you got to have some logistics into this and such to make your art really feel alive and such.	O
To kind of give it some idea of the realism in the world that we do have.	O
So we're going to be making it a gas giant.	O
And we're going to be kind of making it blue is kind of color, 'cause it's really far out in space and it's frozen and there's not much of light to warm it.	O
So we're going to be making that would be having a blueish color.	O
String with a nice blue color.	O
Gonna be zooming in.	O
I'm going to be rhyming the edge so it will be taking our circle again.	O
Bring it back to where we were.	O
We got it from.	O
Going to be filling it as we did before, so.	O
Right there looks really good.	O
Like so we're going to keep it that.	O
Going to fill that kind of keep it as so.	O
Very carefully, very easily.	O
Like so they're going to fill that with some white.	O
So you know what we're working with here.	O
We have our line.	O
That showing our planet's atmosphere.	O
Right there.	O
So now we're going to be starting to shape it.	O
So we can take different sorts of things.	O
We can make it have rings or multiple planets around it.	O
We can also do those kinds of certain things as well.	O
Here we're going to be doing since it's only going to be a certain reflection, not the entire deep inside the planet isn't going to be fully.	O
It's not going to be fully shown because it's only a small amount of light coming from the actual Galaxy itself, so.	O
We're going to be doing is I would have taken better mixed and we're taking a nice little blue Hue.	O
Will it to the wire side?	O
Going to be kind of doing this very carefully to not get it onto the space like so.	O
Like that OK gives it that Inter death be bringing that down a little bit.	O
Good making certain lines.	O
Showing the gas planets, different layers and such.	O
Thanks so alright getting a little bit darker color.	O
Really don't align it too.	O
Give it that nice old Hugh.	O
Even a little bit here, they turn down the flow.	O
And we're going to be bringing it on the sides a little bit.	O
And you can see here we go, but too much going to be bringing down the flow even more.	O
Even more very slightly.	O
We don't want to sell it too much.	O
So you can see.	O
Right here, giving it a Nestle Hugh little blend in Seattle sphere.	O
K never getting it little bit lighter.	O
Pretty light color to lie on the atmosphere.	O
Make it blend in the space itself.	O
Keep on doing that, we're satisfied.	O
This down little bit.	O
And So what we're looking at here?	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Now will be taking some other colors, maybe some.	O

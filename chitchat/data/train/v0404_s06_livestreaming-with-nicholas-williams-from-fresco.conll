Darker Blues, some darker Blues and will be taking different such when we taking maybe some sponge here and kind of lining it a little bit.	O
Some purplish blueish use to kind of go along with the planets different such depths.	O
Some lighter colors.	O
I will be using.	CHITCHAT
Some reason this the sponge again in the light colors.	O
Lightly brush over them ever so lightly.	O
And then you get a line top of them.	O
Then Going to basically we're going to be taking hard round opacity.	O
Bring it down.	O
Every so sorry, so we're going with this.	O
Giving it.	CHITCHAT
So the depth that we're looking for, like kind of the different layers, really popping them out.	O
But still keeping colors that were looking for.	O
They were what we're going to do.	O
Said it looks pretty good.	O
Maybe we can put a little bit more like we can go down to.	O
Let's see go back to FX.	O
And go to the dusty.	O
Get some darker colors.	O
Darkness.	O
Ever so slightly.	O
Giving it some of the effects so then.	O
I'm going to be taking our circle again.	O
Bring it like so.	O
Because we're going to be spending this little bit.	O
Spinning it like so.	O
Just like that.	O
Will be filling that with some black.	O
All the way dead black.	O
But see, it looks a little bit off, you know, looks a little bit not so perfect.	O
So here's how we're going to fix that.	O
Could be going back.	O
I'm going to be going back to Cloudsoft.	O
Can be using our eyedropper again?	O
I'm going to be doing.	O
Little bit like this.	O
Will be zooming in.	O
Sort of blending it in as we did with the with the galaxies so it's going to be a long process, but.	O
Makes it look much more natural and not like some kind of abstract structure.	O
Shipping it again.	O
Now will be taking all the way back to the basics that the hard round opacity.	O
Zoom in.	O
Kind of.	CHITCHAT
Get real close and now put this down a lot more.	O
K.	CHITCHAT
Going down the line a little bit and then doing some kind of swivels here and there.	O
Zoom out into this section.	O
Good.	CHITCHAT
Going down the line once more looks a little too much.	O
There you can see.	O
Very slightly, very slightly.	O
And it looks a little bit off, so we're going to be doing that same thing again.	O

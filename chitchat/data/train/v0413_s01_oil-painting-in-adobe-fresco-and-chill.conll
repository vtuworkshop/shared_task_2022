The only time she's grumpy's if you know she's hungry but everybody except when you're hungry she's doing great.	CHITCHAT
So thanks for asking.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining Kaitlyn.	CHITCHAT
Glad you're here.	CHITCHAT
Hope things are going well for you as well.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, alright, I don't even remember what brushes outlining with Because I was doing this at a different time, but let's just kind of get started here, let's.	O
Pretty sure is a pixel brush.	O
And I'm pretty sure that I saved as a favorite.	CHITCHAT
I hope I did newsprint, let me go guys.	CHITCHAT
So when you're working in your brushes don't forget let me move the camera.	CHITCHAT
You still need to see my face.	CHITCHAT
I mean you can if you want, but.	CHITCHAT
Let's Let's change.	CHITCHAT
It seems that we're doing.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's move this somewhere else.	O
Somewhere else.	CHITCHAT
Whatever.	CHITCHAT
So when you're picking brushes out.	O
And you find one you like.	O
Don't forget to hit the Little Star next to it.	O
So when you need it later you can find it.	O
Pro tip, I guess I don't know.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to actually fade this layer back a little bit.	O
Just start doing some outlining an I wonder.	O
OK so something else to pay attention to.	CHITCHAT
Also, while I'm doing the outlining on this, I like to do my outlines in a layer above because then.	O
You can paint below it.	O
Let me just turn off my layers here.	O
So you can see I've got this layer above, that's just the outline.	O
So that way when I paint below.	O
The black outlines stay on top of it and don't get mixed with the oil paints, so that's what we're doing here today.	O
I don't even remember What is this one from.	O
Oh nice.	CHITCHAT
Sweet, alright, let's keep going here.	CHITCHAT
Trying to think of fun stories, I could tell you well, I'm well, I'm working here I think I'm going to put these outlines on separate layers for each Penguin.	CHITCHAT
That way if I want to move around or do something else with them, I have an isolated in the future instead of all the outlines on one layer.	O
So I'm just going to keep, I think work in that way, so will make a new layer.	O
And let's start outlining.	O
Oh, right now going to do this instead, Alright?	O
Hey Jeannie, thanks for joining.	CHITCHAT
Hi Derek, just curious why use pixel brush for outlines rather than vector?	O
That's a super great question.	CHITCHAT
To be honest.	CHITCHAT
I just with this specific project.	O
I liked this brush that I was working with better.	O
I just like how it felt when I was using the Apple pencil on the screen and not that I couldn't use a vector brush.	O
I'm sure there's some great ones in here.	CHITCHAT
It would be smarter to work in Vector, but because I'm working with oil paint anyway.	O
That's not scalable anyway, so not that it didn't matter, but I just liked the feel of the pixel brush that I chose.	O
So that's kind of why we're working with the newsprint pixel brush today.	O
So oh wow, guys.	CHITCHAT
So what's funny is before I go live.	CHITCHAT
I get all nervous.	CHITCHAT
I get all scared and stuff so now I'm trying to draw my hands like shaking and it doesn't want to draw good.	CHITCHAT
But whatever we're going to have fun with it.	CHITCHAT
We're just going to go so.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being mostly nice on the screen everybody and not.	CHITCHAT
Calling me bad names.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I've been really enjoying.	CHITCHAT
That's what you get for not turning your phone on do not disturb before you alive.	CHITCHAT
I've been really enjoying really enjoying the iPad and Apple pencil combo and at night I'll just kind of sketch to unwind a little bit and.	O
And I find.	CHITCHAT
I don't know about you guys, but I get.	CHITCHAT
I get kind of.	CHITCHAT
Not writers Block Creative Lock, right?	CHITCHAT
So it's like I don't know what the don't have to sketch out what I wanted to do, and so I find that for me, even though I went to college for art I can sketch, I can draw, I can do all those things, OK?	CHITCHAT
I mean like fairly decent.	CHITCHAT
I still find though for me it's so relaxing to bring in a photo or like in this case it's a painting and just trace over it.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty mindless, but you still have.	CHITCHAT
The ability to.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
What's the word?	CHITCHAT
Artistic freedom to just kind of do whatever you want.	CHITCHAT
So for me getting the trace something and then refine it a little bit as I go is super cathartic.	CHITCHAT

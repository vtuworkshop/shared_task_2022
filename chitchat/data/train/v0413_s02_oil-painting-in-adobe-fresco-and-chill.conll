I'm still struggling my hands still shaking a little bit, but that's alright.	CHITCHAT
We'll get there so I think I'm going to do to kind of get over this.	CHITCHAT
The whole going live thing is just go live more often.	CHITCHAT
So Oh my gosh you guys.	CHITCHAT
I did the that's what I love about digital painting too.	CHITCHAT
So anytime you screw up you just tap with two fingers on the screen.	CHITCHAT
It's your undo state so it goes back so that.	O
Is A plus.	O
It's going to take me like 10 minutes to draw this stinking eyeball 'cause.	CHITCHAT
You know, things Genie says turn up the smooth function coffee in the morning.	CHITCHAT
Yeah for sure.	CHITCHAT
OK, so Speaking of coffee in them.	CHITCHAT
We live, we live where we live where we live.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
So there we go.	CHITCHAT
I actually, so I'm using a couple things.	CHITCHAT
I'm all over the place today.	CHITCHAT
I use this app called stream deck on my iPhone so I've got different scene set up for my live stream which is super cool.	O
I love I use E Cam live broadcast.	O
I might switch to streamlabs obese but for now so I've got all these little scenes for focus.	O
There we go and accidentally hit the end stream button went onto my phone.	CHITCHAT
My bad.	CHITCHAT
We're back, hopefully didn't didn't go away.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I was going to say is so I'm drinking a bang energy drink which says.	CHITCHAT
Not intended for individuals under the age of 18.	CHITCHAT
Right here on the back.	CHITCHAT
So it can't be good for me, but there I like them.	CHITCHAT
They're delicious.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, and if you haven't had breakfast yet, you get, so it's probably not the nerves from the live stream.	CHITCHAT
It's probably 'cause I'm drinking this.	CHITCHAT
Toxic thing I need to switch to water and I also went to Starbucks and I'm drinking half.	CHITCHAT
I've got half of A.	O
Blonde roast in here.	O
So I that's what that's exactly what's happening, right?	O
That's what's happening.	O
I can't draw good and stuff alright, or speak well, alright, just Java what's that?	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining?	CHITCHAT
That's funny alright.	CHITCHAT
So we are going to keep outlining an I don't know were mostly just hanging out.	O
You guys can watch kind of sketch.	O
I don't think I have anything mind bending to show you today.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I'll show you something, mind bending that was cool that I discovered by discovered.	CHITCHAT
I mean all this was actually something cool I could use down here in the bottom you can't even see me.	CHITCHAT
Down here in the bottom left there's this little ruler icon.	O
Tap on that and it can bring a ruler on your page and you can turn it any direction you want.	O
So I was having a lot of fun drawing lines with the ruler function.	O
Just drop right on the side of it here to scale it around.	O
Moved around, draw straight lines so I was doing some 3D stuff and that was fun.	O
Fun stuff.	CHITCHAT

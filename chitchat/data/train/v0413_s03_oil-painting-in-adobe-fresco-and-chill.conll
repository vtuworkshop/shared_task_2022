I'm assuming that you're talking about, but anyway, some of the projects that I've got working on it.	CHITCHAT
I can't show you yet because they're either not.	CHITCHAT
You know there were still in progress, so from a professional standpoint like I can't display some of the cool things have been working on when it comes to branding and websites and stuff until they're done, which is kind of a bummer because you know, there's some really cool things, Anne.	CHITCHAT
And they want to show the process and then by the time I can show it to you.	CHITCHAT
I've totally forgotten how I made it, so that's kind of a bummer and that's been something else to have been trying to figure out is.	CHITCHAT
When I go live, what am I going to show you guys and so?	CHITCHAT
I'm always looking for fresh ideas and trying to figure out what you want.	CHITCHAT
So for those of you who joined the Facebook group, if you're not, if you're not part of the Facebook group.	CHITCHAT
If you go to.	CHITCHAT
Facebook.com/groups/complete graphic design.	O
I think I mentioned that in yesterday's live.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what the screen shows.	CHITCHAT
Awesome.	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness, all kinds of chaos on my screen.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we'll go here if you're not part of the group yet.	CHITCHAT
Join the group because I definitely check out all of the questions you guys ask, so it's up here.	CHITCHAT
Facebook.com/groups/complete graphic design.	O
Jump in there.	CHITCHAT
Lots of really cool people answering your questions.	CHITCHAT
If you get stuck on stuff, but when you join it asks what do you want to learn?	CHITCHAT
and I read those things so I love checking out your artwork.	CHITCHAT
Jump in here.	CHITCHAT
And join the group so I can see what else you want to learn about, so that would be helpful too.	CHITCHAT
'cause I mean, this is fun and all, but I don't want to, just.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to be showing you guys stuff that you want to learn about so.	CHITCHAT
OK, Jean says, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Yes, love it.	CHITCHAT
Cost of this is this is really interesting.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you can cover different topics every now and then so different topics.	CHITCHAT
Do you mean like what kind of topics Gustavo Genie says?	CHITCHAT
But I don't understand how to use its masking function at all.	CHITCHAT
The masking is to be honest, I started fooling around with that a little bit more an I'm not I I get it but I don't get it enough to not screw it up as I'm probably teaching it live.	CHITCHAT
So will I need to circle back?	CHITCHAT
There's some really cool things we can do with that.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe we play with it now I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Caitlin, that's hey.	CHITCHAT
What's up?	CHITCHAT
My wife is on here Hygena that's my wife everybody.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for posting the group.	CHITCHAT
What else are we?	CHITCHAT
Should post Jenna post the images on the move Instagram page if you guys want to see what we're up to you.	CHITCHAT
And stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Also, if you want to learn more about freelancing and you want to learn about how we do it, we do so as a family.	CHITCHAT
My wife and I worked together out of our Home Office.	CHITCHAT
I would show it to you, but it's a train wreck right now.	CHITCHAT
'cause I flipped everything on its head to set up this live stream so will finish that in.	CHITCHAT
So this where I'm streaming from actually used to be our master bedroom because it's got the most space in the House and so my wife and I moved our bed downstairs basically into what would be the formal dining room so our kids could all have a bedroom.	CHITCHAT
It's a mess guys.	CHITCHAT
It's a hot mess, but that's what's fun about doing what we do and just going after it just.	CHITCHAT
You know, if you want something, make it happen, and so we're willing to kind of live a little crazy and try things out.	CHITCHAT
We bought a bus a how many path like an 84 passenger bus that we're going to renovate and turn into.	CHITCHAT
Kind of an RV situation.	CHITCHAT
And so really excited about that.	CHITCHAT
We have been able to do anything about it, yet it's got some problems that are pretty expensive to fix, so it's kind of on pause.	CHITCHAT
But all that to say like we love adventure.	CHITCHAT
We love getting crazy and just trying things out.	CHITCHAT
And so my wife and I worked together.	CHITCHAT
She's the project manager for everything we do and she manages our Facebook group.	CHITCHAT
She also has her own business writing.	CHITCHAT
She's amazing.	CHITCHAT
And so I guess I'm telling you all this if you guys have a desire to do this and to see how we make a living, she has a group called freelance circus which is posted it in here yet.	CHITCHAT
But the freelance circus is something new that we're starting up that the goal is to kind of teach how we do it from finances, from tracking time to how to land clients to.	CHITCHAT
OK, now that you've landed the client, how do you do the work?	O
And how do you make money doing creative stuff like this?	O
Whether it's sketching in Frisco or making logos or making videos.	O
Or designing websites.	O
So we've done a little bit of everything.	CHITCHAT
Excuse me.	CHITCHAT
We've done a little bit of everything, and we've.	CHITCHAT
Buy a little bit of everything.	CHITCHAT
what I mean is we live in Kalispell, Mt, so there's there's not a lot he ran when we first moved here after we got married.	CHITCHAT
I basically had to take on any work I could to stay afloat, right?	CHITCHAT
So it required us to get very creative.	CHITCHAT
And so I would say yes to any project that came out way, whether it was, you know, web design or whatever, so that's kind of the feeling circus is all about is showing you how we do it and how you can follow suit.	CHITCHAT
Hold on.	CHITCHAT
So this photo I'm working on, the colour is nowhere close.	O

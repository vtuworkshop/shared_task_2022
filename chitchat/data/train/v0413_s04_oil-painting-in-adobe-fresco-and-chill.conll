Nowhere close to what the actual picture is, so I'm just looking at my screen and looking at these colors real quick.	O
I just want to kind of make it in the ballpark.	O
I really like it.	CHITCHAT
Just looking at that.	CHITCHAT
All right, back to the sketching.	O
Let me go into the comments or quick.	CHITCHAT
Did you do to do?	CHITCHAT
OK, 'cause I've says so.	CHITCHAT
As far as other topics like how to animate a logo intro on after effects or some procreate design I don't know so I'm on be hands right now.	CHITCHAT
I totally don't tell anybody guys.	CHITCHAT
I love procreate and I know fresco will get there.	CHITCHAT
It's new an appropriate has a couple of features that I really enjoyed that I feel like when I come into fresco.	CHITCHAT
Mike, why doesn't this have this yet?	CHITCHAT
But I know they'll get there.	CHITCHAT
The brushes are amazing in Frisco and the oil stuff we're about to get to here in just a second.	O
But I love procreate and I want to do more of that too.	CHITCHAT
You'll probably see some of that coming out on Skillshare.	CHITCHAT
I have a skill share channel and then also on you to me as well.	CHITCHAT
I would love to stream it here, but I don't want to get in trouble because I was asked by Adobe to live stream here which is super cool.	CHITCHAT
Such a privilege, and so we're going to definitely be focusing on the Adobe side of things here on this stream.	CHITCHAT
That being said, yes, I found a super cool tutorial and I would love to be the guy just to teach it to you, Gustavo.	CHITCHAT
But if you check out let me see.	CHITCHAT
It's Levi.	O
I think it's Levi Allen is his name.	O
Let me just check it out.	CHITCHAT
He has a really cool YouTube.	CHITCHAT
There it is I think I found it YouTube video.	CHITCHAT
Let me switch to be used to the.	CHITCHAT
This one maybe?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let me.	CHITCHAT
Right, this one's for you guys that also animating titles.	CHITCHAT
This is a really cool project.	CHITCHAT
I want to show you and maybe we'll get there, but if I don't just in case I don't get there in time, check this out.	CHITCHAT
This is so cool.	CHITCHAT
How to make hand drawn?	O
Titles video titles alright this guys name is Levi Allen.	O
He is amazing.	CHITCHAT
Super cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
This might not OK so he uses procreate.	CHITCHAT
You could do some fresco also.	CHITCHAT
He draws them out with an Apple pencil in he's using procreate again and then you playback the when you're all done you do your stuff, you export the video.	O
That it does the time lapse of you drawing and then you'll bring it into Premier.	O
Right, so he's got this playback of what he just drew and then he changes the blend mode to screen right?	O
So then the black goes away and now you've got an animated hand drawn title over your video.	O
Super cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Let me grab this link real quick.	CHITCHAT
You guys can check it out.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, I've got a million and a half windows going on.	CHITCHAT

This one cool.	CHITCHAT
I hope it helps somebody.	CHITCHAT
I think it's super cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna start doing that with my videos as well.	CHITCHAT
How to evaluate the pricing on some projects we do, that's a tough one to Gustavo.	O
How, how to evaluate pricing back to that.	O
Freelance circuits are going to get into a lot of that.	O
Genie says.	CHITCHAT
I understand we had to move studio.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, into tiny room up the garage when.	CHITCHAT
MOL moved in for awhile.	CHITCHAT
Oh gotcha.	CHITCHAT
Mother in law.	CHITCHAT

Three years like 2 years at one point and then three years another time.	CHITCHAT
And it's just what you do guys, that right there, that right there.	CHITCHAT
If you guys want to be in this field.	CHITCHAT
And make a living doing this.	CHITCHAT
You gotta be willing to be crazy an for us.	CHITCHAT
Living with with anybody, anybody on any side other than your distinct family unit.	CHITCHAT
Whether or maybe it's living with your parents.	CHITCHAT
If you're trying to go to college like there's no shame in that, that's about hustling.	CHITCHAT
That's about getting it done so you can live the life you want to later on getting set up for that.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I totally get it.	CHITCHAT

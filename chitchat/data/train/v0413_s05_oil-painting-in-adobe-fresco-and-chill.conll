I feel like this has turned into a self promotion.	CHITCHAT
Video I don't mean for it to be that way, I just get excited and have resources.	CHITCHAT
Were trying to do the stuff here in sketchy.	CHITCHAT
We're not even doing it yet.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
I did an octopus sketch for inktober an I did the time lapse and it's one of my favorite things that I've done so it's at instagram.com/dimensional design somewhere.	O
It's somewhere in there, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Oh, actually I did the fresco video on it too.	CHITCHAT
On the YouTube channel, that's probably a better place to find it.	CHITCHAT
'cause then you can see how I went about doing it all right?	CHITCHAT
Let's start painting some more doing things.	CHITCHAT
I should probably double check with.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know what time it is.	CHITCHAT
Maybe jenn you can post how much more time, how in the line before I gotta bounce.	CHITCHAT
This goes so fast always.	CHITCHAT
Let's go so fast.	CHITCHAT
What time is it?	CHITCHAT
I've got it as almost 11:00 o'clock so.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I'm going to get to it here.	CHITCHAT
Also, I love the interaction guys.	CHITCHAT
I love being live and just hanging with you guys.	CHITCHAT
It's my favorite.	CHITCHAT
Gene says the time lapse logo idea with screen mode layer, although I sometimes don't get what screens etc types of layers are 4.	O
I think you mean so.	CHITCHAT
It's called a blend mode, so I think is what you're talking about.	O
Jeannie, the blend modes.	CHITCHAT
So when you're drawing or painting let me see if I can quickly just throw a sample out here, it will be kind of dumb, but will.	O
Will do something we're going to jump into my oil.	O
Or my watercolor brush.	O
Now let's do.	CHITCHAT
Let's do the oil paint.	O
Let's change my color down here to something that will be obviously crazy.	O
And easy to see let me brush size bigger.	O
Alright, so let's just say I've got something over the top of this.	O
There it is alright so.	CHITCHAT
On this layer I'm in Frisco on the top right.	O
We've got this little icon with the.	O
3 lines in the circles.	O
OK, so this is my layers property and when we talk about blend modes, so right down here we've got blend mode currently set to normal and I think any creative app in.	O
Adobe anything has blend mode style, so after effects, premiere Photoshop, illustrator, indesign were in Frisco right now.	O
They all have blend modes and what it does is whatever is on the top.	O
Whatever layer you're working with, a blend mode is how that layer interacts with the layers below it.	O
So how does it?	O
How does it do different things?	O
and I would say the three different little say, 4 different blend modes that I use.	O
All the time, like probably in most of my stuff, would be obviously the first one is normal, so nothing is happening.	O
It's behaving exactly like you would expect.	O
I use multiply which would multiply, will do anything, white goes away completely and then it it multiplies the color with the layers down below.	O
So you can see that Green gets darker.	O
It multiplies that effect.	O
You know would be a better way to show this.	CHITCHAT
Let me let me go back to normal.	CHITCHAT
And let's jump back on the screen layer and I'm going to paint some white.	O
I'm going to paint some black, so we're going to do some white over this.	O
Also super cool.	CHITCHAT
Look how that oil paint blends.	O
With the green that's already down there, I love fresco.	O
I love that.	CHITCHAT
OK so we got some white.	O
We're going to blend it in with this green a little bit kind of.	O
I don't know, we're just we're just goofing right now.	CHITCHAT
Going to get some black you come down here paint some black will maybe blended in a little bit so we can kind of see shade it blend it whatever.	O
So we've got some white into a green into and actually let's throw some other colors in here just to really understand this principle a little better.	O
This is the grossest.	CHITCHAT
Looking, I like to make my tutorials pretty because you know this is graphic design.	CHITCHAT
It should kind of look nice.	CHITCHAT
I hate it when.	CHITCHAT
You're trying to learn tutorial and they're just nasty looking art working like I would never want to create what you're showing me, you know.	CHITCHAT
So I was trying to take the time to like pick pretty colors and do it right, but this is whatever were flying fast and loose here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we've got a layer with white, blue, Red, Black.	O
I'm going to jump back into my layer properties down to the blend mode, run normal.	O
We're going to multiply and you can see how the black stays dark.	O
The white goes away completely.	O
the Reds in the Blues and greens kind of just multiply down with whatever's blow it all right?	O
Great so I use normal.	CHITCHAT
I use multiply.	O
I use screen so you can see what screen does there to brighten things up.	O
I use that with some highlights and some other things too.	O
Especially working with photos and then I use overlays.	O
Another one I'll use.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you can see that it does there.	CHITCHAT
And then screen where a screen at.	CHITCHAT
Do they miss it?	CHITCHAT
I think I did.	CHITCHAT
There it is screen OK so you can see what screen did is.	O

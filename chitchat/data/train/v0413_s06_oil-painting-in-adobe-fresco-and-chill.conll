That totally removes the black from the layer, but the white you'll notice is still very opaque over the top right.	O
So that's how in that video tutorial for the titles how they did that they draw their stuff out and then hit screen in anything black.	CHITCHAT
So the black background he started with totally goes away.	O
Super cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
So that's blend modes.	O
That's how you would use them in your artwork.	O
Another example of me goofing around with screen modes and look at the drawings I love.	CHITCHAT
I love scrolling through this stuff and seeing stuff that my kids have done too.	CHITCHAT
All kinds of stuff, all kinds of stuff alright?	CHITCHAT
Where there we go?	CHITCHAT
Right, so here's an example of a document that I was playing with in the photo shop for iPad.	O
App doing some different things.	CHITCHAT
This is for a client called tough country bumpers.	O
They make bumpers for cool things like this razor.	O
They've got this cool front bumper you can do so.	CHITCHAT
I was mostly just goofing around with assets already had so I had this razer black and white thing and so these burst these lines he's starbursts around the edges if I play in my layers.	O
Oh, these are photoshopped layers.	O
How did I?	CHITCHAT
Is the wrong document I think, is why?	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, it's because I was in photo shop playing with it.	CHITCHAT
Right, so now I'm actually in the photo shop app router fresco, which is also cool.	O
Alright, so now I can see this layer.	O
So these bright these bursts are actually.	O
Have a brightness contrast layer on top of it, but in that layer I'm also playing with blend modes.	O
Let me see if I can see it.	CHITCHAT
So I just like a million things going on.	CHITCHAT
I was I dealing with this one.	CHITCHAT
There we go alright.	CHITCHAT
So what I did I'm on this layer 3 document.	O
I clicked on the layer options thing here to bring those up.	O
And my camera is in the way, so let me let me turn that off, remove it for a second.	CHITCHAT
Alright?	CHITCHAT
So you can see the blend mode I'm using on this one is called Vivid Light, so if I were to put this back to normal vivid light, let's put it back to normal.	O
And that changes how those interact.	O
So a lot of times what I do like, there's blend modes like all these different blend modes, all behave differently depending on the artwork you're working with, so a lot of times I don't always know what I want to do with it.	O
I just start goofing around an.	CHITCHAT
And just quickly tapping on stuff and just say, Oh that one looks cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, cool, we're going to stay with that one so that's blend modes.	O
That's how I work with that.	CHITCHAT
And stuff like that so.	CHITCHAT
Alright, also super cool tip, I just learned you guys on your iPad.	CHITCHAT
You guys probably know this.	CHITCHAT
You don't care on your iPad at the bottom.	CHITCHAT
You have this little white line that's there always.	O
In just about any app you use.	O
And I gotta do is swipe left or right in any app and it just swipes between the apps.	O
All of 'em super cool.	CHITCHAT
So now I'm in photo shop.	O
Now I'm in Frisco now I'm in photo shop back to Frisco.	O
Definitely cool.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's go back into the comments how we do, and I've been.	CHITCHAT
I've been yakking for awhile here.	CHITCHAT
So that's a cool angle.	O
I like that angle.	CHITCHAT
I was trying to get my.	CHITCHAT
did I tell you guys alright so yesterday I was setting up this camera angle and I was trying to tighten up the stand.	CHITCHAT
And it swung.	CHITCHAT
Loosen smacked my 27 inch display and cracked it right in the middle.	CHITCHAT
So I'm super.	CHITCHAT
Super sad, so I hope you really enjoy this angle that I have not finished setting up.	CHITCHAT
So you can see what I'm drawing and doing what I'm actually doing.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be equal angle, it's just not quite right yet, so we'll get there.	O
Will get there.	CHITCHAT
It'll be fun.	CHITCHAT
All right, back to the comments, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Alright jeans, right now.	CHITCHAT
I don't really understand it in photo shop either.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to know how the creators came up with the names of those blend modes.	O
I mean, why does multiply mean white goes away?	CHITCHAT
That's me.	CHITCHAT
Just saying why God so way multiply it just multiplies the colors it as you see it gets darker, but that's me trying to explain what it does.	CHITCHAT
Cool Gene, God, that was helpful.	CHITCHAT
Secret Service says it's cool how it displays the preview.	CHITCHAT
According to the blend mode.	O
Yeah, that is cool in the photo shop on the iPad.	O
That is a cool feature that I don't think it does on photo shop on a desktop yet.	O
Yeah, No, she says no.	CHITCHAT
I'm assuming about me breaking my display.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it's not that it's not like it's not like it's cracked like you could imagine it could have been, but it's just it's right in the middle of my screen where I do my design work and every time I see it, I cry a little bit so.	CHITCHAT

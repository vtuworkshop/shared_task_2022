That's how it is, alright?	CHITCHAT
So we are in where we even at Alright.	CHITCHAT
I'm all over the place.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging with me today guys.	CHITCHAT
This is fun.	CHITCHAT
I'm having fun.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having fun.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have to go here pretty soon to to get back to.	CHITCHAT
I mean I could sketch and draw all day long.	CHITCHAT
My hope is to show you guys some cool tips, hang out a little bit, answer questions.	CHITCHAT
It's barely above my wife.	CHITCHAT
Do you see that?	CHITCHAT
No, this is.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you have to deal with you guys.	CHITCHAT
I'm in trouble.	CHITCHAT
I was going to say like all these feeds I I'm I hope my goal is to show you guys some cool things and I see some streamers when you go live.	CHITCHAT
It's easy to just some of these guys will live for like 4 hours 5 hours and I get that if you have something cool you're working on and you're just you're on and you're streaming and that's kind of back to where I wish I could do that with some of my stuff.	CHITCHAT
Some of the really cool stuff that I feel like the most helpful.	CHITCHAT
I can't show you yet so I'm trying to find a balance between just not that this is killing time for me, but this isn't this project is just one that I would.	CHITCHAT
I want to do 'cause.	CHITCHAT
It's fun which is so important to have those projects, but I have a list in front of me of real life work that needs to be done today.	CHITCHAT
So I'm gonna have to leave pretty soon.	CHITCHAT
So I really appreciate you guys coming on to hang out with me today and I need to confirm my live streaming schedule, but currently we're planning to go live everyday at 10 so 10 AM mountain time.	CHITCHAT
So if you're in Pacific Time Zone, that's nine central would be 11 in East Coast would be noon.	CHITCHAT
So that's my current plan to go live with something.	CHITCHAT
And mostly I love these conversations.	CHITCHAT
I love seeing you guys in the chat and I'm just kind of goofing off in the background, but I will also have some some real client case studies from real projects and tutorials.	CHITCHAT
We can download the files and things like that too.	CHITCHAT
I think that's really important if you're looking for the quick hit tutorial stuff.	CHITCHAT
Shameless plug.	CHITCHAT
Check out my graphic design boot camp if you go to google.com/vault, you'll see access to everything I've ever created, which is I've ever created, which is more of a tutorial based lessons that are very succinct and.	O
Are meant to get you up and running quickly with the graphic design software, and I also have a YouTube channel youtube.com/derek Mitchell where you can get some of the more sis synced tutorials about specific stuff.	O
So there we go let's see.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
OK, genius is OK, so showing the blend layers was only on the iPad version, not the laptop was right.	CHITCHAT
No, uh, OK so.	CHITCHAT
So the blend modes.	O
No, I said she saying, yeah, the preview we were seeing we were in blend modes when I was when I had them pulled up.	CHITCHAT
It's not pulling up now.	O
I don't see that in photo shop.	CHITCHAT
Currently it could be coming soon, or maybe it's already there, but I don't remember seeing that there, but they do have blend modes.	CHITCHAT
You just have to cycle through it real fast and just see you just pick one that you like but you don't get to see a preview tell you do it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, just offices I have just downloaded fresco.	CHITCHAT
By the way, I'll play with it and maybe share with you the results.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'd love to see you guys are up to.	CHITCHAT
You can post links in the chat of this video or if you want to upload artwork in an.	CHITCHAT
Screen shares of what you're what you're doing.	CHITCHAT
Something else and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Go to the Facebook group.	CHITCHAT
We check that out so.	CHITCHAT
What else?	CHITCHAT
OK so in preg in European time prog we have.	CHITCHAT
We have a friend that lives there.	CHITCHAT
European time is about 7:00 PM so that's good.	CHITCHAT
I was going live later an I think I didn't get as much engagement or people because a lot of my students are in other parts of the world and they were sleeping so we're going to go earlier.	CHITCHAT
That means I get resumes from artists all the time.	CHITCHAT
They don't have any digital skills and I send them all their bootcamp.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
I wish I could get you an affiliate link with special promos that would be cool.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that's possible.	CHITCHAT
Maybe Jenna we can.	CHITCHAT
We can look at that, but.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, alright So what I want to do?	CHITCHAT
I've been, I've been talking a bunch.	CHITCHAT
I am going to sample this color from this Penguin here.	O
We're going to get back to doing a few things real quick, grab the the eyedropper tool an something that's brand spanking new.	O
New enough that I'm not super comfortable with it yet.	CHITCHAT
Is this little icon in the bottom left?	O
It's a circle, so you click the eyedropper tool at the very bottom left of our sidebar.	O
Click on this, you see it's blue.	O
Now you can select multiple colors, so I'm not very good at.	O
How it's supposed to work?	CHITCHAT
OK, so if you look at the top right you can see it's selecting the Orange, the green and the black I think.	O
Yeah guys, I don't know it's a brand new feature.	CHITCHAT
I want to play with it but it will sample.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to do it like this so you can see I know I'm not doing it right but check it out.	CHITCHAT
That's cool new feature.	CHITCHAT

So now I go back to my brush and go back to the oil.	O
Oil pan round or what is it will paint around.	O
I can't read there we go alright and I'm just going to get my size right.	O
So it's sampling all three colors from what we just did, and I know there's a way to refine that better, but it's a cool feature that I will find a way to use.	O
And show you guys what I do with it right back to the eyedropper tool turn that multicolor off.	O
Or maybe not.	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Just like right there so we've got the multi color sampler and then we've got the regular one color sampler right?	O
So I'm just going to grab this color.	O
I'm going to come back over here and I don't like.	O
I'm trying to modify it a little bit so it looks closer to what the actual painting was.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
All right, now we're going to paint the fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
The cathartic, mindless fun stuff, alright, I'm going to turn off the visibility of that layer, just I can see a little bit better of what I'm doing here.	O
My outline is above.	O
Uh, what am I doing wrong later?	O
Click on this empty layer up here.	O
Now we can get to it.	CHITCHAT
Let's do it.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna click on the top.	O
And go full screen with it.	O
Trumpet players first then go full screen with it alright?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Jesus, I got the fresco update with smoothing brushes.	CHITCHAT
Can't figure this out.	CHITCHAT
Will play with those here, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, geniuses angry.	CHITCHAT
I don't get that new feature either.	CHITCHAT
I guess it's like the CC tool to generate pallets.	O
Yeah, there's you know, it's so that's an issue I get with a lot of my students is.	CHITCHAT
How do I?	CHITCHAT
How do they?	CHITCHAT
They don't know how to get what's in their head out onto the canvas, and they also feel like they're not good enough, right?	CHITCHAT
They have those feelings like like who would ever pay me to do this thing?	CHITCHAT
I'm not good enough.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to be good enough.	CHITCHAT
I'm not as good as this other person and I would like to tell you I feel the same way all the time and it's called impostor syndrome and a lot of people feel that way and that's why I'm forcing myself to go live in show.	CHITCHAT
The unfiltered.	CHITCHAT
Like you know, I'm not good at everything.	CHITCHAT
There's things that I don't know, but when you see a Polish tutorial, it looks like I know everything like Oh my God she's so smart.	CHITCHAT
He knows all these details is like no, that's just one of like.	CHITCHAT
A million things you can do in the software and a million things that I don't even know.	CHITCHAT
There's 100 ways to do the same thing.	CHITCHAT
And there's there's so many ways you can use these applications from video to print to web 2.	O
You know photography, there's so many different workflows that it's.	O
You I don't.	CHITCHAT
I would go on a limb and say you could not possibly know everything.	CHITCHAT
I've been in photo shop for last.	CHITCHAT
I think if we said it was like 21 years it since Photoshop 5.5.	CHITCHAT
Trying to think of what.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's like 20 plus years that I've been using photo shop.	CHITCHAT
I don't know everything like.	CHITCHAT
I'm a long ways from doing everything and then the moment you think you do know everything.	CHITCHAT
Hey guess what?	CHITCHAT
There is an update and now you don't know everything again, right?	CHITCHAT
So it's one of those things where you kind of have to at some point just lean into it and do what you like and be OK with not knowing everything.	CHITCHAT
and I would even go so far as to say is specializing in what you want to do more of because that will attract more.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to do sketches, don't show business cards in your portfolio.	O
I think only show sketch work and that will start to attract right?	O
The law of attraction or you'll start to attract more of what you want.	CHITCHAT
There's your life skills.	CHITCHAT
For the day.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I have to help somebody out, but but you're not going to know everything, it's just not possible.	CHITCHAT
Is not so.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what else Jesus agree 100%.	CHITCHAT
Text Alice is I remember now how I got to know your work.	CHITCHAT
I bought one of your courses and you do me a few years ago and I loved it.	CHITCHAT
I guess it was a boot camp about illustrator, indesign and Photoshop.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I guess doubled.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much for your support in joining that course.	CHITCHAT
That is my flagship course.	CHITCHAT
So it's called graphic design boot camp.	O
The goal with it in it needs I need to add some sections to it, but the goal was literally that a boot camp.	O
The point is to get you up and running fast.	O
I remember when I was in college and I used to take you have to buy the books.	CHITCHAT
the Adobe photo shop.	CHITCHAT
Like what they call it.	CHITCHAT
It was the first one is like the Bible right?	CHITCHAT
They called it the Bible or whatever it was like everything, every single tool, every single menu item and then there was the other ones called classroom in a book.	CHITCHAT
I probably have it on my shelf behind me here, but they were the worst.	CHITCHAT

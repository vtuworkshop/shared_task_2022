I hated them because it was like OK, great.	CHITCHAT
Now I know how to use the selection tool or no.	CHITCHAT
Now I know what a blend mode is.	CHITCHAT
Crap and pain in the wrong spot.	CHITCHAT
No I just didn't finish my sketches.	CHITCHAT
But Whoops, now I know how to do all these different tools, but how would I like I don't have any idea of when the right application like When would I ever use this tool?	CHITCHAT
I don't know like how would I use this in the real world?	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't have any clue and so that's where the boot camp came from was me trying to create something for the person who's kind of like me and wants to get to the point real fast.	CHITCHAT
And as far as I don't like live streams might get to the point to the point like stay focused.	CHITCHAT
I just I just need to know this quick information.	CHITCHAT
So like.	CHITCHAT
That's that's kind of where that boot camp came from.	CHITCHAT
The idea for it was just to create projects that would quickly get you up to speed.	CHITCHAT
You're making a poster, I think in the first 10 minutes of the course, so that's where that came from.	CHITCHAT
But I thank you very much for your support and purchasing that course.	CHITCHAT
We've got some new stuff out.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'm about to do something.	CHITCHAT
I should probably guys.	CHITCHAT
OK, so in your color Swatch is.	O
I click on the color Swatch down here.	O
Let's see, I've got the recent tab, so I'm about to switch colors to black, but I don't want to lose track of what I'm doing so you can add Swatch is and save them that you go down to all and these libraries sync with my clients, so I'm using the libraries feature of the creative cloud.	O
So all of these colors everything I do, for example complete graphic design for the boot camp.	O
Those are the colors I used for everything in my boot camp stuff, so I didn't load this into fresco.	O
I put them once in through photo shop.	O
And I can use them across any application I use, so this is under the colour.	O
Swatch down here under also.	O
That's usually called apps.	O
You got the HB sliders and stuff, but click down here on all in recent colors.	O
And then you can see your libraries, which is super cool.	O
Alright, what I'm going to do is jump over here to Recents.	O
And I can keep track of the colors of using right now within this project, so I hope they help somebody out.	O
Back to turn to draw straight lines, although.	O
Not as jittery as I was a second ago, so that's good news.	CHITCHAT
That's good news.	CHITCHAT
I need to work on the smoothing options, but I.	CHITCHAT
That's later, we'll figure that out later.	CHITCHAT
Oops, wrong there.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
The whole Yeah Geniuses, I saw someone referred to those three apps as the Holy Trinity of graphic design.	CHITCHAT
I believe it.	CHITCHAT
I tell people if I got stuck on an island and I only had one thing I could bring with me, it would be photo shop.	CHITCHAT
Just because you can do.	CHITCHAT
Just about anything in photo shop now.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's probably not always intended to be used that way.	CHITCHAT
So for example, you guys to make videos in photo shop.	O
There is a timeline you can do that with.	O
You can make logos in photo shop.	O
I recommend illustrator because of the vector.	O
You know, putting it in a vector format so that way it's scalable, but you can make logos in photo shop and you can even work in vector files in photo shop like if you keep it.	O
If you keep your type.	O
But there you know and use shapes and stuff.	O
It's possible it's not at all recommended, but hey, if you had one thing to do if you're going to keep your subscription to one thing with the Adobe cloud, I would do photo shop.	CHITCHAT
It's just me.	CHITCHAT
I think you can get it for like.	CHITCHAT
Correct me if I'm wrong.	CHITCHAT
I think $19.00 a month.	O
Some apps stand alone apps like you know, fresco if you just got that, I think it's like 9 Bucks a month, but for the whole package I think we end up spending about $80.00 a month.	O
But we have the Adobe stock assets as well.	O
It just makes it so much easier to jump into a project and know that if the client doesn't have any photos, I don't have anything to work with.	O
I mean sometimes they use pixels.com or different resources for photography, envato elements is awesome.	O
But it's so nice to be able to round trip.	O
You're so you basically jump into photo shop.	O
You can search for a stock image right inside of their, pop it in your artwork.	O
You'll have the Adobe Watermark at first.	O
But if the client approves of it, all you gotta do is license it, and at that point sometimes I license it anyway, 'cause it's only a few bucks per photo, so it's not I mean not that it's not that big of a deal, but when you're working on a project that might be 5 to $10,000 to be able to just kind of move it forward without.	O
Slow in the project down like I'll just Buy photos.	O
I don't even care because you know the amount of time it takes some time to go back and forth on stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
It's just nice to be done with it and make a decision and so that $3 decision could save me an hour which is worth it so.	O
Anyway, that's that's what I think.	CHITCHAT
That's what I think.	CHITCHAT
Random brushstroke out here.	O

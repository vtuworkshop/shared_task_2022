Let's erase that.	O
All right guys.	CHITCHAT
She said wait wait wait.	CHITCHAT
Oh, Jenna sent a codes.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, you do.	CHITCHAT
Me is totally cracking down on how they do things.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Cool, thank you guys for your support.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I really, really appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
My family appreciates it specially now.	CHITCHAT
This is basically what I do full time so that in some of these projects that I'm working on alright.	CHITCHAT
So alright we are color in this in we're having a good time I need to wrap this up pretty soon though.	CHITCHAT
I gotta get back to.	CHITCHAT
Not that this isn't the real world, but to the real world of client projects and phone calls and.	CHITCHAT
All that kind of stuff, so we're going to wrap this up here in just a few minutes in the last questions or thoughts.	CHITCHAT
And thanks again for watching everybody.	CHITCHAT
It's been fun having you here.	CHITCHAT
I really loved having your questions and and.	CHITCHAT
Just support, otherwise I feel like I'm talking to myself.	CHITCHAT
And it gets real boring.	CHITCHAT
Real fast, wrong brushless switches back to the oil brush.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I love drawing and painting.	CHITCHAT
I should do more of this, but hey, now I can.	CHITCHAT
'cause I get to go live and so my personality type is.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I not like I always need to be working 'cause I definitely play a lot to living in Montana.	CHITCHAT
We go skiing and biking and you know paddle, boarding and all the fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
But I.	CHITCHAT
I feel like because I like to draw and sketch so much, but I don't always.	CHITCHAT
Obviously it's not a billable project for keeping you know.	CHITCHAT
Paying bills and stuff.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to allow myself to do it without feeling guilty, so.	CHITCHAT
So being able to do it for a live stream is fun.	CHITCHAT
'cause now I feel like I'm contributing to society somehow and enjoying what I'm doing, so there's that.	CHITCHAT
Open cheezies here and there will probably bounce.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Jeannie, are you in our Facebook group?	CHITCHAT
I think you aren't you.	CHITCHAT
And if you've depending on, I might even have, well, whatever we'll figure it out will figure it out.	CHITCHAT
So something I have not explored a lot with is the affiliate stuff for our courses I would love I mean.	CHITCHAT
I'm totally happy to share it.	CHITCHAT
You know, if somebody encourage somebody to buy my course and you get a little bit of cut from the sale, that's fantastic.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love more than anything like I wish.	CHITCHAT
You guys are probably the same way.	CHITCHAT
I wish I didn't have to try and make money with this stuff like I just love doing it.	CHITCHAT
I love helping people, but at the end of the day, like if I can't pay my bills, I can't keep doing what I'm doing and showing you guys stuff.	CHITCHAT
So it's kind of that whole necessary evil of everything, right?	CHITCHAT
And I think that's something that is actually a good topic that I ran into when it came to like freelancing and charging clients.	CHITCHAT
I was so torn because I would do it for free.	CHITCHAT
I would do I would make logos for free like I just love it a lot of times I do a lot of times I'll take on projects that are pro Bono or that like.	CHITCHAT
I just do it.	CHITCHAT
It'll take me 10 minutes.	CHITCHAT
But the reason why it takes me 10 minutes is because I spent 20 years.	CHITCHAT
Getting really good at my craft and so you have to remind yourself that it's OK to.	CHITCHAT
To charge a client to do something.	CHITCHAT
You know too.	CHITCHAT
To keep doing what you're doing, you gotta pay for your Adobe subscriptions, right?	CHITCHAT
You gotta.	CHITCHAT
Pay for the new fancy.	CHITCHAT
Tools that come out, whether it's a welcome tablet or iPad or you know you've got to be able to stay current, so it's important to be able to.	CHITCHAT
Become really good at your craft an make a living in charge people for it.	CHITCHAT
So that's my thought, that's how I.	CHITCHAT
That's how I do things.	CHITCHAT
Why did that color not sample?	CHITCHAT
Awesome Jeannie.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad she says You and Jenn are the reason I make.	CHITCHAT
Wait that I am not afraid to ask people for money anymore.	CHITCHAT
I know the money topic you guys so taboo in society, right?	CHITCHAT
You're not supposed to talk about it, you're.	CHITCHAT
And I understand like I totally get it, but this is business, right?	CHITCHAT
This is a business and right now right now what I'm doing specifically as a hobby, right?	CHITCHAT
But your hobbies can be your businesses and you can thrive doing that.	CHITCHAT
An what we found.	CHITCHAT
It was really difficult when you were working with a client who was a really small like mom and pop.	CHITCHAT
Kind of a scenario where every dollar was their own personal money that they were probably investing back into the business.	CHITCHAT
Those were really difficult because they have such awesome stories.	CHITCHAT
You really want to help them, but almost never do they have.	CHITCHAT
A budget set aside for creative and then if you can start finding those businesses that are a little bit bigger, right?	CHITCHAT

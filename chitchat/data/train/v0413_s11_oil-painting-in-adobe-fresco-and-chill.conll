They've got they've got some employees, but they're still kind of in the startup phase, but they've set aside, you know, a few $1000 for, you know, a website and logos and the creative stuff that you have to have to be a forward facing business.	CHITCHAT
And so those are the ones what's cool about it is they understand the value.	CHITCHAT
They've also set aside money and it's not there.	CHITCHAT
Money is there.	CHITCHAT
The stewards of the money like they have to make good decisions with it, but they don't really care so much.	CHITCHAT
They're not going to be like telling you hey, use this font.	CHITCHAT
Use this color.	CHITCHAT
Can I see 400 different versions of it?	CHITCHAT
'cause I want to make sure I'm getting my moneys worth from you for them for those types of clients, you're just solving a problem.	CHITCHAT
So what's cool about it is the faster you can get it, solving somebody's problem.	CHITCHAT
And by problem I mean you know the problem might be hey, I don't have a website.	CHITCHAT
Can you make me a website or the problem might be?	CHITCHAT
Hey I need more customers.	CHITCHAT
Can you create me a Facebook ad that will get me more customers right?	CHITCHAT
So how much you willing to pay to get more customers well?	CHITCHAT
I'll pay a lot of money if that customer buys a big product that then makes even more money.	CHITCHAT
So at that point you know you frame what you're doing based on the problems are solving, so an example of that would be our WordPress course that we sell and show you how to make WordPress sites so WordPress is free.	O
You can download it.	O
Go to wordpress.org.	O
I think it is and you can download everything in WordPress for free.	O
Doesn't cost you a dollar.	CHITCHAT
Then you could go to an app called local by Flywheel.	O
And I've got a course on this.	CHITCHAT
You can check it out and you can have a website up in like 5 minutes.	O
It doesn't take anytime at all, so why would a client pay me?	CHITCHAT
In fact case in point I've got a client who has, we just landed it to $10,000 website.	CHITCHAT
We will be starting it the 1st of June and we're giving a $5000 deposit.	CHITCHAT
So why am I telling you all this?	CHITCHAT
Because hopefully it inspires you guys that this is possible.	CHITCHAT
You can do it and, but why would somebody pay me $10,000?	CHITCHAT
And it to do something that they could essentially do for free.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm solving a problem for them, they don't know how to do it.	CHITCHAT
They could figure it out, but how many hours?	CHITCHAT
How many months?	CHITCHAT
How many years have I taken to get fast at this right?	CHITCHAT
And so for them.	CHITCHAT
They don't see it as oh, I could do this for free.	CHITCHAT
They see it as I need a website and I need it soon and I needed to do some specific things and I will pay you to me.	CHITCHAT
It is worth this much money, right?	CHITCHAT
And so that's where you reframe your approach on the stuff and how you're OK to talk about money because you're no longer talking about like, well, in your mind like what I'm doing now.	O
Specifically coloring this Penguin, it does not cost me anything.	O
It's I'm working in pixel data, all maybe some battery power an maybe my time, right?	O
And maybe somebody wants to pay me.	CHITCHAT
Probably not for this one, but maybe somebody wants to pay a couple $100 to do a an illustration or a logo for them, right?	CHITCHAT
And that's where it's not about me going.	CHITCHAT
Oh well, it didn't cost me anything, it's more about.	CHITCHAT
You're exchanging value.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I am rambling, but I really hope that helps somebody out.	CHITCHAT
Um, and encourages you today.	CHITCHAT
So there we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, that is looking cool.	O
I think I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to play with this for a really long time, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see other comments.	CHITCHAT
How long do I think it'll take me to complete the website?	O
OK, so that's those are the details that get real tricky really, really, really tricky.	O
I have blueprints set up inside of flywheel where I can push a button in the site would be up and on in 30 seconds, right?	O
Not bad for $10,000.	CHITCHAT
However, that's not how it goes, ever.	CHITCHAT
You get it up, you send it to him and there's a lot where the value really comes in is all of the hand holding and you're talking to the person.	CHITCHAT
You're getting assets.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes they don't even have those assets, so I have to either hire A writer or general right, or I will write copy for the website.	CHITCHAT
So that takes a lot of time.	CHITCHAT
It's a lot of time invested.	CHITCHAT
If I was just turning on a website with like a home about and contact page, I could probably do it in about 3 hours and make it look really good.	CHITCHAT
It would have a lot of things that need finished, but in this case the project will probably.	CHITCHAT
I would like to have it done in two weeks, but I'll be hiring a have a guy I work with kind of a subcontractor that will be doing some of the work and so obviously have to pay him some of that.	CHITCHAT
Jenna will be doing some of the project management.	CHITCHAT
I've got another guy that will be doing some of the project management that's more client facing, so all of a sudden that budget kind of goes out the window real fast and then it will probably take me.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably have 80% of the work done in about 2 weeks, and then that last 20% of the work will probably bleed out for about two months so.	CHITCHAT

That's a huge like.	CHITCHAT
What's the word that's that's?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Not fact, that's just kind of how I anticipate this.	CHITCHAT
Probably going so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and I Jenna says she says people can set up a website for free, but part of the value is the custom design.	CHITCHAT
The custom design.	O
Also it's we have spent.	O
Years and have invested thousands of dollars in training to learn about marketing and how to do things a certain way.	O
Like you can throw website up.	O
But is it effective?	O
Does the user know what to do?	O
So all those things are value add ONS when you're selling somebody a website, you're not selling them.	O
Hey, I can make you a WordPress website and I'm going to charge you $500.	O
It's I'm going to make you a website that then will tell your brand story and will help you sell your product right?	O
So they don't care if you use WordPress or square space or which they don't.	O
Most clients don't even know they don't.	CHITCHAT
Even care, so it's a matter of finding what you're good at and what works for you.	O
And then from there you can.	CHITCHAT
Get really good at it and then resell it as a service right?	CHITCHAT
And back to that whole, attracting what you're interested in.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to do sketches and drawing, do that all the time.	O
Tell everybody you know the best.	O
So this project that we have I didn't have to sell it to anybody.	O
I have a friend who knows who who knows me, knows what I do and he had a client that to start up big time start up.	O
Obviously to have that kind of a budget.	CHITCHAT
So I didn't even have to.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even have to do anything honestly are.	CHITCHAT
Let me look.	CHITCHAT
This deal.	CHITCHAT
Happened over a text message.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can find it.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, he goes.	CHITCHAT
Sorry this will be good for you guys to see I think we overthink things a lot.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Sorry, hold on, I'm trying to find this text thread to show you how basic this was and I know this is not the normal.	CHITCHAT
This is not the normal, this is just me showing you that.	CHITCHAT
How I did this?	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, apparently text a lot.	CHITCHAT
That helps too.	CHITCHAT
There's a relationship there, so there's a strong relationship here, right?	CHITCHAT
It wasn't a cold call.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh my goodness.	CHITCHAT
Well, basically.	CHITCHAT
He was like yo we need a website.	CHITCHAT
It needs to have E Commerce.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, we've texted a million times.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe it's not showing up.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's 'cause I'm in the wrong text thread.	CHITCHAT
Dang it.	CHITCHAT
Also this text thread.	CHITCHAT
Has a million texts.	CHITCHAT
My gosh.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm taking too much time.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry guys, I just really wanted to show you this so you can see what my response was because I feel like it was really.	CHITCHAT
Really good.	CHITCHAT
Whatever, OK?	CHITCHAT
Bummer, OK.	CHITCHAT
Basically he was like yo.	CHITCHAT
They need a website, they need an E Commerce site.	O
You know, how much would it cost and.	O
How long do you think it would take?	O
And I said something to the effect of well.	O
I can tell that you just put the phone down there.	CHITCHAT
I said something to the fact of like, alright, well, obviously I can't just throw a number out there because that could mean anything and I said, well, I said most of our websites cost between 2000.	CHITCHAT
To you know, as much as you can imagine, but it really depends on the level of.	CHITCHAT
Details required And.	CHITCHAT
How much hand holding?	CHITCHAT
So what I meant by that was kind of cryptic.	CHITCHAT
'cause I knew the client we were going to be working for was very needy.	CHITCHAT

A very needy client.	CHITCHAT
So those are the things where your bill goes way the heck up, 'cause you have to do a lot more client interfacing, meetings and things like that.	O
And that's where the cost comes in.	O
So I responded with that and I said, You know, ultimately, looking at what you guys need, I would estimate between 7000 to $10,000 and he was like perfect.	O
That was exactly the range I was thinking.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'll let you know, and then later I got a text that said hey budget was approved for 10,000 and so like it was literally a simple text message.	O
It wasn't a long email saying here's, you know, 10 pages of lawyer will uris trying to describe the project, it was just it was a relational handshake, right?	O
That's how that happened.	CHITCHAT
And so that's why I say.	CHITCHAT
Get really good at your craft.	CHITCHAT
Figure out what you like and then tell everybody you know about what you're doing right and that will attract more things to you like that.	O
Alright, so let's see let me I missed a bunch of text thread stuff.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's see, let's see.	CHITCHAT
For weeks at most, my wife has a.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, yeah, the Pablo Picasso myth yes where I think so.	CHITCHAT
Jeannie says the story that I'm talking about where you know this ladies like Hey Mr Picasso, can you draw me this photo real quick or dropping this photo?	CHITCHAT
Drama is real quick and he's like sure he whips it out and hands it back to her in like 30 seconds like wow that was amazing.	CHITCHAT
He's like, yeah that'll be and I forget the price.	CHITCHAT
I don't know $2,000,000 whatever it is like what and he's like.	CHITCHAT
You know that only take you 30 seconds and he's like well yeah it took me 30 years to be able to draw that in 30 seconds.	CHITCHAT
I'm totally butchering the story.	CHITCHAT
Go read the story, it's good stuff.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's see to be 40 years.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, they go um, what else with us with us?	CHITCHAT
They go exactly Jeannie.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for posting that.	CHITCHAT
Yes, OK, so Genesis.	O
So this project I'm talking about.	O
Yes exactly, I know I throw big numbers around trying to encourage you, but also if it's overwhelming, keep in mind I met this person back in 2011, I think maybe 2008 been along time so we have established.	O
A relationship for a very long time.	CHITCHAT
I've worked with this person on many other projects, so he knows I can do it.	CHITCHAT
He knows that I'm good, and he knows that I'm fair.	CHITCHAT
Like I didn't just throw the number 10,000 dollars out there like I knew what he was asking for and I knew about the level of Polish is what I call it like, how, how much extra do we want to put into all those details?	O
So that's where that came from.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so this is a very casual interaction.	CHITCHAT
Now on the Flipside, this exposes us because I don't have a contract to them yet with specifics.	O
This could bite us in the butt real fast because we need we need to get some what we call deliverables an Esso W or scope of work.	O
So I need to set up.	CHITCHAT
Here's phase one face to face, so phase one is like OK, we're going to create some ideas that we're going to publish it.	CHITCHAT
Phase two might be not publish it were to create some ideas, send you some comps to look at.	O
Phase two is revisions and setting things up.	O
Phase three is.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Or maybe phase one is like your simple brochure site.	O
Phase two would be like adding E Commerce to it or something.	O
OK anyway, setting up phasing, setting up milestones like when?	O
Will these be done?	CHITCHAT
Setting up the scope of work like how much are we doing on this page?	CHITCHAT
Is it just a photo in some text or is it like some really intricate artwork so we need to circle back and kind of backfill some of this so we don't get in trouble by in trouble?	O
I mean the client thinks we're doing a $20,000 value website and we were like Oh no, we're done like we've spent 1000 hours on this thing already.	O
Let's see services.	O
Yes, I totally understand that personalized UI, our UX UI and copy build the value of your project.	O
It was curious because I have to build a website for and for an architect studio.	O
Yeah, 20% OK.	CHITCHAT
So with our agency we typically whatever we think the project will be, we add A.	O
20% buffer on top of that, just as wiggle room and then one of two things happens.	O
Either you needed it.	CHITCHAT
And you still came in under the clients budget.	CHITCHAT
They don't know that you build them for 20% more of what you think it should be.	O
They don't even know that, but then you have to go back asking for more money or and or you get it done in the time he thought you could.	CHITCHAT
And now you've got a 20% windfall that you could either keep as a bonus 'cause you did good work, good for you, or you could give some of it back to your client, or roll it into something else, or do a little bit of extra and really impress them.	O
So either add something else into it, or even give them a discount at the end of their final bill.	O

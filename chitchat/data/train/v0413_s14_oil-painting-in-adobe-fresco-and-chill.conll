Say, hey, you know, I know the last bill is going to be $4000.	O
But we came in under, so this ones only 800 right?	O
Like that is great customer service and they will sing your praises to everybody.	O
So that's what we try to do.	CHITCHAT
So this is so cool that you share the same passion at work is Jenna you and Jenna or yes, I usually prefer to be paid per project.	CHITCHAT
Main concern is to deliver a beautiful and functional design and counting the hours.	O
Yeah, that's good.	CHITCHAT
It's we.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Easy will make it extremely expensive.	CHITCHAT
Another example that I talk about with billing.	O
So I did a brochure for a.	O
It was like a, you know it was it was a nonprofit organization an I think I estimated the brochure to cost $750 and they were happy to pay it.	O
It's what I call design by committee.	O
There was like 13 people who were decision makers and so I said, OK who's the one person who's going to tell me what you know?	O
The final says I don't want all of you calling me at the same time so I gave him the estimate they were happy it fit within their budget that they had and I went to work.	O
Long story short.	CHITCHAT
Finished everything, I crushed it.	CHITCHAT
I did a great job.	O
An later I went back and re telling my hours is like Oh my gosh I made like $150 an hour on this project and at the beginning of the project had I first approached the client and said hey I'll make you a really cool brochure and my hourly rate is $150 an hour.	O
They would've been like no we're going to have an intern do it, so that's back to that value.	CHITCHAT
Selling of a website of a brochure of a UI UX design.	O
You're selling the value.	O
How much is this problem solved?	CHITCHAT
Worth to you?	CHITCHAT
And then as you get.	CHITCHAT
Better you make more money per hour.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise if you charge per hour.	CHITCHAT
Flat rate, let's say charge $50.00 an hour.	O
As I get faster, I make less money and it's not always all about the money, but it is about.	CHITCHAT
Business and what sustainable?	CHITCHAT
So you don't want to just like screw around and take extra time because you're trying to make more money.	CHITCHAT
That doesn't work right.	CHITCHAT
Alright, alright guys I have had a blast on this live.	CHITCHAT
I really enjoyed this.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what to call it because we didn't really do a whole lot of fresco but I love getting to talk with everybody and answer questions and just kind of seeing where it goes so.	CHITCHAT
It's been really great.	CHITCHAT
I really have enjoyed you guys.	CHITCHAT
The questions in your feedback.	CHITCHAT
I set up a new domain name called creative brief dot live and currently all it does is it just forward says be hence channel.	O
But what I would like to do with it is turn it into something where I go live frequently.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that's daily or weekly or a couple times a month, but the purpose being taking a creative brief like a real creative brief from a client that we've had, whether it's make a website or whatever, will try and keep them small, almost like a daily challenge.	O
But the point is to help build up your resume, build up your portfolio and your website and stuff so.	O
I'm excited to do that.	CHITCHAT
I'm still fleshing out ideas.	CHITCHAT
Would love your feedback, but in the meantime, yeah Jeannie.	CHITCHAT
Jeannie says.	CHITCHAT
Maybe talk about frescoes masking and those new smoothing brushes in the future.	O
Definitely will do I will do that.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Jeannie.	CHITCHAT
In fact, I'm going to take a screenshot of that comment so it's on my desktop.	CHITCHAT
Boom cool alright I don't know my week schedule I gotta run it through the family calendar but I think I'm cleared to go live every day at 10.	CHITCHAT
I will send out more emails and things like that, but be sure to like this video.	CHITCHAT
Give it a follower, thumbs up or whatever you can do here, and hopefully it will tell you next time live so you don't miss it, but we will get a live schedule set out and try and be a little more predictable with this.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, thank you guys so much for your feedback and for being a part of this stream.	CHITCHAT
It's been fun being on here but I have got to bounce so have an awesome day and if you're not part of the group already joined that Facebook group and we will see you.	CHITCHAT
And the next one someday.	CHITCHAT

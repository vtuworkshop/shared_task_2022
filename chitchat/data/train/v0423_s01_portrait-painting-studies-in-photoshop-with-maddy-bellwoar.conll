Steven, that is an intense question.	CHITCHAT
Well, let me get started on the painting so I can and I'll paint it and talk at the same time.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's a good question.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put.	O
I have a timer that I'm testing.	O
This is a new plugin that hopefully will be available soon for anybody that's interested.	O
My boyfriend does web development and he has been working on this plugin for photo shop, so I use stuff like this all the time.	O
So hopefully it's going to work well.	O
I'm trying to find bugs and stuff in it, so an hour and 30 minutes is what I'm going to try to spend on this.	O
This portrait will see if we need more time, but I think that's a good start, alright?	O
I am going to start with a sketch because I find it helpful to begin with a sketch.	O
But the whole impostor syndrome thing.	CHITCHAT
So if anybody doesn't know what she was talking about for my understanding impostor syndrome is this that idea that you, no matter how good you get it something sometimes?	CHITCHAT
Or how like how well known you might get if you are, let's say you start having a following for your art or something like that.	CHITCHAT
You still have these feelings inside that like you're not good enough or or other people might think you're good, but somehow it's going to come out that you're not good and it's just like an illusion or something.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of that feeling.	CHITCHAT
And I think.	CHITCHAT
I've definitely had this discussion with a lot of other artists, seen a lot of other artists talk about their feelings about this.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It's something that is not related to your actual quality of work.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of like a mindset thing.	CHITCHAT
That's like a fear that people can have.	CHITCHAT
And it's not just in the art industry, but you know in any industry you could feel that way.	CHITCHAT
You could feel like you know you're just not there not.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how to say it, but it's definitely something that can be put my reference on the other monitor 2.	CHITCHAT
I think it has more to do with your mindset than your actual quality of work is.	CHITCHAT
What I'm trying to get at.	CHITCHAT
Hey red, it's good to see you and you too.	CHITCHAT
Michael, welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
We're talking about Steven asked a question about impostor syndrome.	CHITCHAT
How do you know if you have impostor syndrome or you just are into that good?	CHITCHAT
I guess I just don't think that it's a.	CHITCHAT
What's the word?	CHITCHAT
I don't think it's like a useful question because it doesn't matter if you are.	CHITCHAT
If it's true that you aren't that good, being that good is very.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
What's the word when something is only exist in relationship to its relative?	CHITCHAT
I'm not that good if you compare me to like not, you know, some master artists that I look up to.	CHITCHAT
But you know someone who's just starting out might think that I'm amazing an I'm happy with where I am compared to my past, but I still have places I want to get too.	CHITCHAT
So who's to say if I'm good or not good?	CHITCHAT
It's all relative and it's not really useful to think about it that way, because if you are, if it's true that you're not that good or if you're anywhere along in the process, there's always room for improvement.	CHITCHAT
So even if it turns out that you, let's say, let's say you have a long way to go and you're just starting out and it's true that your skills are not at a high level, acknowledging that it doesn't really matter, you just need to keep going kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
Um even says, obviously, that question doesn't apply to people working as artist.	CHITCHAT
They have a feedback loop in the people are spending money with them, but I disagree because I know professional artists that still feel that way.	CHITCHAT
I think it has a lot more to do with how you feel than any reality of the situation.	CHITCHAT
That's my point.	CHITCHAT
Like I really don't think that.	CHITCHAT
I think that impostor syndrome has more to do with how you feel than.	CHITCHAT
Anything else?	CHITCHAT
So that's just my my opinion since you asked.	CHITCHAT
I, that's yeah, I don't know what else to say about it.	CHITCHAT
I feel like you just got to keep working.	CHITCHAT
If you feel like so.	CHITCHAT
I've heard this phrase before and I agree with it.	CHITCHAT
Competence brings confidence, so the more that you work on your skills and improve them, you can form confidence from that you know.	CHITCHAT
If you feel like you are somehow a fraud because you don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know have solid foundations to your skills.	CHITCHAT
Then just work on those things.	CHITCHAT
Don't make it a doesn't have to be a negative thing.	CHITCHAT
Just keep working.	CHITCHAT
I think having high expectations feeling like you need to appear perfect.	CHITCHAT
All that stuff is where the impostor syndrome kind of comes from.	CHITCHAT
Read says my boyfriend is a developer and he had this thing mindset each time that he gets stuck or something like he's not worth paying and not going to going to get fired.	CHITCHAT

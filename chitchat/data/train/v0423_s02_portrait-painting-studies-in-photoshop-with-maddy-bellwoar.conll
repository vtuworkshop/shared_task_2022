And I'm like struggling struggling happens.	CHITCHAT
Just try exactly exactly.	CHITCHAT
You know what I'm having trouble.	O
Visualizing this as a sketch, I think what I'm going to do is just start painting and blocking in shapes rather than sketching out the whole face.	O
I'm like not really feeling this workflow, so let's try that instead.	O
Let's do a little workflow shift.	O
You know what I'm saying, Stewart?	CHITCHAT
So it's not about question.	CHITCHAT
That's just my feelings on it.	CHITCHAT
But if you are feeling that way, you know you really not alone.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people out of artists go through having that sort of feeling impostor syndrome.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited, hey, let's Alpha welcome.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I'm gonna start, let's start with let's just start with a dark background I should have just dropped a paint bucket in here but.	O
Will do it the old fashioned way.	O
Alright, I'm going to start with a dark background because we're working digital.	O
We can do this.	CHITCHAT
I've been doing a lot of photos.	O
I've been doing a lot of watercolor painting lately and I can't really do this and with watercolor, but it's nice with digital.	O
We can work this way, so I'm using my soft shading and blending brush and we're going to like come out of the shadows here.	O
So even says, why do you draw with drafts?	O
Not with a pen.	O
Accuracy will be better.	O
I use I do very very my sketches never get How do I say this?	O
I don't make line art.	O
I do like a rough sketch 'cause it's it's real quick and then often I go into the painting phase really, really fast.	O
This is faster than usual.	O
Usually I have sketched out a little bit more, but I just wasn't feeling it.	O
But whenever I do a sketch, it's never going to remain in the final like some people have lines in their final work as part of the art style.	O
I never do so for me.	O
It's kind of a waste of time to make this sketch really detailed.	O
Most of when I like to figure things out is in the painting process when I'm working with shapes, I find that this is a preferred workflow.	O
If I was ever going to have the line art.	O
In the finished one.	O
Then I probably spend a little bit more time on it.	O
So right now I'm working on.	O
Blocking in shapes, it's going to be a bit messy at the beginning, but hang tight yesterday.	O
I did some portrait practice.	O
During a friends live stream and like painted along, it was really really fun.	O
So I'm kind of like excited to work on this and definitely move for it, but just be aware the early stages are often a bit bumpy.	O
That's just how it is.	O
You gotta, you gotta build up from something.	O
For those of you who aren't familiar with my portrait work, I can show you the painting that I did yesterday.	O
This was about 45 minutes, or an hour's worth of painting.	O
Honestly, this one went better than I was expecting, but this is the kind of style I'm going for right now, so that's what hopefully will get something like this.	O
But it starts like this.	O
It starts rough, an gets more and more fleshed out, more more narrowed down and detailed.	O
And Yeah, but you gotta start somewhere.	O
So I'm focusing on the.	O
Where the lighting is coming from, we got one side of her face pretty heavily lit and trying to look at the planes of the face and the big shape, so I'm kind of going to like Sculpteur from the shadows.	O
I like to flip the reference a lot and my painting a lot as I work.	O
Is it helps me notice that things are wonky.	O
This one is a bit hard because of how dark it is.	O
Oh, thank you Jane.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
If you guys are interested in painting along, you could find the references below the stream in the description.	O
There's a link all of my reference images are from Pexels Unsplash Pixabay, plus the places like that, so you're free to use.	O
Some photographers have uploaded them there for people to use, which is really generous and I use those sites a lot for art references.	O
Oftentimes, portraits like really creepy at the beginning, so I apologize.	O
I'll try to get the eyes in there as soon as possible so it makes it a little less creepy, but you can see I'm kind of focusing more on the face structure and like making a place for the eyes to sit in.	O
And then we'll be adding the eyes into there.	O
Jane says anything it kind of good art.	O
Need solid foundation, traditional Art Foundation.	O
Well, I started as a traditional artist because.	O
Well, I was young and that was the most accessible thing.	O
I do agree that you have to have a solid foundation, but I don't know if you have.	O
I don't think feel very strongly that you have to start with traditional art necessarily.	O
I do think you need to start with foundations or at least spend some time on foundation.	O

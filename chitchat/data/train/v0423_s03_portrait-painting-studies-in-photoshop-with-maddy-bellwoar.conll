Things like basics of composition, color theory.	O
Proportions values, that's probably the most important things.	O
The relationships of dark, dark to lights in your images, stuff like that.	O
I don't know that you have to do it on a traditional medium.	O
I think you can do it digitally.	O
I think those things transition.	O
Thank you, Stuart.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
They did I did get invited to stream here, which I was really very happy.	CHITCHAT
Very happy to be invited.	CHITCHAT
Someone messaged me houssami streaming on Twitch.	CHITCHAT

Nowadays I do more traditional work there.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, Kate cable.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
So I'm right now, the things I'm trying to pay attention to, our proportions of the face and also the edges, like trying to look at the silhouette.	O
Well, it's not much of a silhouettes.	O
Pretty dark over here, but I'm trying to look at the line at outside of her face.	O
So for example, different people have different proportions.	O
Sometimes the you'll have a really a cheek bone that protrudes out more.	O
Sometimes people will have a square jaw for each person.	O
You can have these different features so I'm trying to pay attention.	O
To that Hey Jackson.	CHITCHAT
That's so funny welcome.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, that's great.	CHITCHAT
Well I'm glad you managed to find your way here.	CHITCHAT
Even without the notifications.	CHITCHAT
And thank you for thank you for the follow again.	CHITCHAT
It's funny.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I've gotta move her up on the page a little bit and let's just block in her shirt.	O
Kind of roughly here.	O
That's not the right color.	O
So I probably won't go too much in detail with like the patterning on her share will just will just throw it a color in here.	O
If we have time, we might do a little bit more, but that's not the most important thing I'm probably going to kind of.	O
She's going to like dissolve into the shadows around her.	O
Welcome everybody, I'm sorry I can only read I can only read in English unfortunately so.	CHITCHAT
I apologize, I cannot answer everyone's questions.	CHITCHAT
You could try using like a Google translator or something like that.	CHITCHAT
And then I'd be happy to.	CHITCHAT
Happy to try and answer if you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's actually paint in some facial features now.	O
I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm using a brush that really doesn't allow me to be very detailed at all.	O
Highly ards good to see you.	O
We are we're doing portraits today.	O
So you guys can see this brush.	O
It's pretty, it's pretty soft and it doesn't get too.	O
There's only so much detail you can really do with it, but it's great because it kind of prevents me from getting too detailed too soon and give some nice painterly look.	O
You can download this brush for free below the stream in the description there's a link to a free brush pack and this one is in there.	O
It's called a soft shading and blending brush.	O
OK, so let's get her eyes and.	O
At least in a basic.	O
Gotta start somewhere and then we can adjust.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We can add the whites of the eyes are going to be pretty dark still is this is an overall pretty dark scene.	O
I hope you guys are having a good day so far.	O
Mine was a little hectic this morning, but it's nice to chill now and paint with you.	O
Oh Man, I look.	CHITCHAT
I love painting portraits.	CHITCHAT
Looking like your painting a demon for the 1st 20 minutes or so.	O
I guess we can put the I in.	O
Um Stuart says the quick I drop you use between brush mark how are you getting the color as the primary?	O
I use the shortcut but it appears on the secondary color is that your custom shortcut?	O

OK, So what I'm doing?	CHITCHAT
I hope I'm going to answer your question.	CHITCHAT
Basically, when you have the paint brush selected, if you hold alt at any point it'll bring up the color Picker an I think what it's doing is it's showing you your current colour on the bottom and then as you hover over whatever the.	O
Colors is that you're hovering over.	O
That will be the top.	O
Color that it shows and then if you release then it's just going to take that new color.	O
So yeah, I just hold Alt.	O
I bring up all real quick.	O
That way I can color pic quickly and then keep painting.	O
So I do color pic from my own painting a lot.	O
I will go to the color wheel, select a new colour, but whenever I'm just doing shading and blending within one area, I'll just kind of color pic around.	O
In that area for awhile.	O
You're working on to.	O
That sounds good we are.	CHITCHAT
I hope it's going well.	CHITCHAT
I find the whenever I have a portrait that's at this kind of angle, the angle that's away.	O
So like this angle here, I always find that to be like the hardest side of the face to paint for some reason.	O
But I like to have the mindset when I'm doing a portrait, even though it's digital.	O
I like the kind of the mindset as if I'm dropping actual paints on the canvas and then going back and like moving it around and stuff like that.	O
It makes it gives me the mindset that I'm a little bit more relaxed about where I put Marks and stuff 'cause I don't put down a mark thinking it needs to be perfect.	O
I kind of put down a Mark, Thinking, Alright, there's a little bit of this kind of shadow over here.	O
There's a little bit of this kind of color over there.	O
And just kind of start putting things where it close to where they need to be and then going back and refining it rather than needing to make everything perfect with that one brush stroke that you put down.	O
So I try to take that affect that I'm sculpting a little bit more than painting, but of course it is painting.	O
This is a little highlight up here.	O
So that color was a new color.	O
I'd go to the.	O
Had to go to the color wheel and take that out.	O
Alright, let's let's start addressing the nose and mouth.	O
Got highly on the.	O
Chick chick boom.	O
Little shadow here coming from the nose.	O
And we're going to get a new color for the lips.	O
I don't think I have anything like that yet.	O
So OK, so I'm trying to figure out where to put the lip.	O
If I look at the I it comes roughly down under the.	O
The iris and pupil.	O
That's like where the edge of the Live is.	O
So we can come down like that.	O
I think maybe I made her chain like this too.	O
Small, we need to elongate a little bit 'cause her lip doesn't have a lot of room.	O
But again, let's just kind of even if it just looks like a blob.	O
Let's just block in something where the mouth is going to be, and then we can go back and make it look more like her specific mouth shape.	O
But let's just like kind of start with something.	O
Jackson says if that happens, it will mean you have your secondary color selected, so the colour pick will work for that one.	O
You can switch it with little colors icon on the left panels or repressing X Jackson.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
It sounds like I made him may be misunderstood Stewart's question.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate you answering it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out the nostrils where those are going to be.	O
I think it's time to bring some more highlights into that will help.	O
Like for example I don't know what it's called, but like this area right above the in between the lip and chin there's kind of a highlight that comes down there too.	O
This allowed bird outside.	O
Alright, so I'm working on the shape of the like John channel little bit so now I can that I have everything blocked in on the Phase I can actually look at it and start to say OK.	O

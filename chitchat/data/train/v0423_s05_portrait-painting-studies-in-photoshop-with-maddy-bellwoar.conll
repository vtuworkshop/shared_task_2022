What needs work what?	O
What looks nothing like her what I'm talking about.	O
Proportions and location of features.	O
Now that we at least have a whole human there and we can start making changes 'cause there's a lot that needs to be done.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
See up here her.	O
The hair comes a lot closer to the eyebrow, so I'll bring more her over.	O
I want to figure out what the.	O
Where is the brightest highlights one of the brightest highlights in this whole scene is on the nose here.	O
And her nose is very straight.	O
So I gotta work on that too.	O
And I think the.	O
Lips probably the area that needs the most work to look like her, but will get there.	O
I like flipping like the.	O
The canvas a lot to help me notice things, so I apologize if it's.	O
I hope it's not annoying to watch when I do that, but.	O
Just so you know, whenever I flip the canvas like this, I am also flipping it on my other monitor so I know that the little mini references on the screen isn't flipped, but I am.	O
I am flipping the reference on my other monitor when I flipped, so I'm not trying to like just translate it.	O
That would be that would be really difficult.	O
OK Jackson, well thank you.	CHITCHAT
Either way, that's good info to have, I think.	CHITCHAT
OK, so something that I like to do alot when I'm painting portraits is use a multiply layer.	O
So I'm going to make a new layer, put it on, multiply modan, just paint over some areas that needed a little extra shading.	O
And I think I multiply is really great because it it can add extra shadows but doesn't completely cover an paint over what's already there, so it doesn't destroy your work that you've done.	O
It just kind of adds to it.	O
Also, like to use the smudge brush to get rid of hard edges that don't really.	O
Don't really belong.	O
How much work on the lips?	O
I didn't think about it before choosing this reference, but it's a little bit difficult to work on because.	O
It's so dark and I don't know if you can tell, but the room that I'm in is like a very.	O
Is very bright and is a bit of glare.	O
My monitor, so it's kind of difficult to see what I'm doing.	O
Should have thought of that first.	O
I don't know if any of you guys have those problems when you're doing digital art stuff, but I need to get some more intense curtains in this room.	O
There bit sheer don't do much.	O
Alright, let's work on the nose.	O
So under the nose we want to look a little bit more three-dimensional.	O
Shadow down there.	O
There's a very interesting shape to the chin too.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
We're getting a little closer.	O
I have a tendency to make my characters like have a little smile or smirk when they actually don't.	O
Let's go to the curves and just brighten things up a little bit.	O
That will make it easier for me to see.	O
Now usually I kind of late and as I go, but will just go ahead and bring things up right now.	O
So they do another layer going over the areas that do need to be darker and sharper like I've.	O
We will go back right here and give one more pass over the.	O
Basically the Highline.	O
The eyeliner we have a little bit of like a lost edge kind of thing happening over here.	O
The shadow is kind of.	O
Go from her eye into the hair and you get like.	O
Kind of dissolves over there.	O
Stuart says I'm trying to workout why I use the brush and the alt I drop its place in the color on to the secondary Patch 50s X to switch is not quick as I won't primary.	O
That's so weird.	O
So when you when your color picking, it's not changing it, changing your secondary color instead of your primary color.	O

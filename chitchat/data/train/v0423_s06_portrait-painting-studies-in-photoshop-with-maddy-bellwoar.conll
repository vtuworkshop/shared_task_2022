I wonder if there's any settings down here.	O
That are affecting that.	O
That sounds like there's a whole extra step in there for you and I would.	O
I wouldn't like that either.	O
It's going to make things take a bit longer than needed.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I've never heard of that.	CHITCHAT
Feel like there might be something that's just checked in the settings.	O
So our.	CHITCHAT
Up Lovely model here has.	O
Green eyes kind of Green, Hazel eyes.	O
I want to pay attention to.	O
The shape of the island too.	O
I'm going to switch to A.	O
Slightly harder brush or like the next level, harder from this brush pistol.	O
Same kind of style brush.	O
Alright, since we've right and stuff up, I think we lost a little bit of the depth.	O
I'm going to make a new layer, put an overlay.	O
And I'm going to go back in and warm up some of its skin color, like for example on the.	O
On the cheek here.	O
Just going by the reference, give a little bit more of a warm colored there.	O
I'm going to take this much brush an I find this really satisfying to you.	O
I hope you guys can see well what I'm doing, but just taking this much brush and blurring some of the edges.	O
An leaving some of them harder, so for portraits it's really nice to have some last edges.	O
I think it just gives more of a romantic kind of feeling to the portrait and more of a classical kind of feeling rather than having everything very hard.	O
Of course it depends on what style you're going for.	O
You might want stylize hard edges, but if I'm going for more of a classical feeling.	O
So I'm paying attention everywhere that the lights.	O
Hitting or trying to find good places for people with highlights and things.	O
Jackson might be on to something.	O
Usually we can somehow crowd source the answer when there's a bunch of us here.	O
I don't know if anybody decided to tackle this portrait with me, but if anyone's painting along, I hope it's going well.	O
I'm finding this one to be a little tough, but portraits are just the challenge in general.	O
I find it like the first level of challenge in portraits is trying to paint something that has correct, you know, correct human proportions?	O
And then like the second level, is trying to make it look like a specific person.	O
And.	O
He had still something that.	O
Likenesses, especially something that I still can have a challenge with, but it's a fun challenge.	O
It always feels like a sort of a breakthrough when you figure out, like the little bit of change.	O
Oh, I need to move the lip over or whatever it is.	O
Getting like this is definitely an interesting puzzle.	O
So her lip, for example, the top lip is much like wider in the center, right under the nose, and then gets a little bit smaller around the.	O
Edges.	O
Ability.	O
How cool Jackson.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to open this myself too.	O
Ah, so.	CHITCHAT
You have to.	CHITCHAT
Color window color.	O
I depends which one you have in frontier or something.	O
Yeah, look at that.	CHITCHAT
So you have to select.	O
The foreground or background color here.	O
Wow, Jackson.	CHITCHAT
I thought I would have taken me forever to figure that one out.	CHITCHAT

Thank you.	CHITCHAT
That is a good public service announcement 'cause I would probably one day have the same thing happened to me.	O
Alright, so her nose.	O
I'm starting to get the shape on the left side.	O
I don't know if I've made her nose too wide.	O
Those that I'm saying this coming for ages.	O
Oh my gosh, I'm so glad you asked and Jackson was able to figure it out.	O
'cause I haven't had that one happen to me, but I've had like little glitchy things like that happen.	O
Now that particular issue.	O
Everyday is learning day is so sure.	CHITCHAT
One of the great things in Photoshop is that there's, like so many little things that you can select and change to make your workflow more personalized.	O
That also can create little puzzles and problems like that because you know, I didn't know that that's something you could even do I didn't know you could select if you wanted the foreground or background to be the what the color pickers liking it.	O
I'm not sure exactly what I would use that for, but.	O
That's cool, that's an option.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's turn our painting into black and white and do the same thing with our reference.	O
So when I do that, I notice a lot, so I would definitely suggest doing this if you feel stuck.	O
First of all, it's making me realize that my lighting needs to get a lot more extreme.	O
Right now it's pretty flat looking in the in the photo, you see, there's really really bright lights.	O
In some areas, the little highlights on her skin, but other than that, even the left side of her face is like much brighter than the right and it just needs more contrast.	O
So let's.	CHITCHAT
Work on that now.	O
Leart says here's my progress on this one.	O
Going to take a break, let's see.	O
Oh wow, this is so this is one of the other.	O
These portraits.	O
All these references are part of the current art club topic in my discord server were studying stuttering.	O
Oh my gosh, I'm stuttering studying portraits and this is one of the other references.	O
So even though this isn't one that I'm going to be working on today, this is another one that's part of Art Club.	O
An yeah we are.	CHITCHAT
You did a great job with this like the phase is just.	O
Gosh, it looks exactly like her.	O
It looks exactly like her.	O
That's amazing, I'll post the discord link in the chat real quick.	O
There's also when you can find in the stream description below so.	O
If you want you guys can join in there.	O
And join with our studies and things you can share what you do in the discord.	O
We're going to have a little art show an.	O
Go over all the artworks that were that were submitted in there.	O
So I've wanted to spend an hour and a half on this portrait and were half an hour in and I feel like we have a fairly decent foundation for where we are.	O
We have an hour more to make this look nice and hopefully make it look more like her, so I think that's a good place to be.	O
So let's go.	CHITCHAT
I picked a little bit of a different color for the background in my painting than what it actually is.	O
It's really almost black, I think.	O
So I haven't been coloring picking from the actual.	O
Image.	O
But sometimes it's nice to actually go ahead and do that and see where you are.	O
And if you're like on the right and the right color scheme, if you are trying to match it, you can always do your own thing.	O
So I think her like Berry colored shirt.	O
Pretty comes a little bit closer.	O
Been than what I had.	O
I was showing Shauna little more skin.	O

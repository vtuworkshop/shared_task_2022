Alright, so I'm going to work on the area around the eyes a little bit more now.	O
One thing that I noticed in the past was I wouldn't pay a lot of attention to eyelids.	O
I was very interested in painting the actual eyes and the eye liner or make up if there was any.	O
You know that kind of thing but.	O
It's really important to pay attention to the whole area around.	O
I the whole anatomy of the eye lid, and especially if you're trying to get a likeness.	O
If you wanted to feel very 3 dimensional, you need to give a place for the eye to exist in.	O
So I think I will move her eyebrows up a little bit.	O
There's plenty of space here for her eyelid and.	O
There's a little bit of highlight catching the edge.	O
The eyelid over here.	O
I'm telling you that the far side of the face is always my my struggle.	O
Let's give a little more color to the list too.	O
She's got a little bit of lipstick on it, looks like.	O
So I think the corner of her mouth comes down a little bit more than what I've done, so let's try to redo it.	O
I think it's just the natural.	O
Resting.	O
Relax, face that she has and I shouldn't look angry or anything.	O
But her face, her ellipse to kind of do have like a downward tilt towards the edge.	O
So after be careful I don't make her look angry.	O
But I do think we're getting closer a little closer like this wise.	O
I like to pay attention to where there's areas of bounce light and things like on the other side of her face.	O
There's a little bit of light in the corner here and then this area down here, little darker.	O
When I first got into painting portraits, my favorite thing to work on was the eyes, and I would always work on that first, and I would end up making my eyes almost finished before working on other things.	O
Anne, I at one point I kind of made a challenge for myself to try to save the eyes for last because I felt like I was think lifting the rest of the portrait too much.	O
I think sometimes I still.	O
I still do that now I'd like to focus on the rest of the face instead of the eyes.	O
I don't think it really.	CHITCHAT
I don't have a strong opinion on if.	O
That you need to do 1 first I think it's kind of for me.	O
I like to just move around the portrait so I don't have any one area getting finished before the rest.	O
Selena says I don't like when people have hair on the photo that blends into it background.	O
That's a really good point.	O
I think unfortunately one of the other pictures for today blends in a little bit too.	O
The one we're doing right after this has a nice contrast of the background.	O
I do prefer that as well.	O
I think it's harder to paint something like this, but.	O
It was a really.	CHITCHAT
I think it's still beautiful photo before painting.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't make it easy.	CHITCHAT
That part.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think this layer.	O
Improve the likeness of it.	O
I'm going to work with the airbrush.	O
I do this a lot with painting portraits.	O
I think the airbrush can be really really helpful, especially if you're painting like a young character like this at a young person.	O
That has some skin.	O

You don't need to be afraid of using airbrush a little bit so I can use it to add color or soft shadow or something.	O
Sometimes I'll use the lasso tool to block off an area.	O
So for example, if you do, what kind of hard edge here?	O
And then you can use the airbrush to pop in that shadow.	O
If you do end up with a hard edge, you can use the smudge brush to brush that away.	O
If you can get too much.	O
Hi happy, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hi IRA, loving the shapes.	CHITCHAT
The phone already really emphasizes the planes of the face.	O
Thank you, thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's very kind of you.	CHITCHAT
I've been trying to pay more attention to that and I feel like the I feel like hard edge brushes are really helpful.	O
Of course I'm using airbrush right now 'cause I'm.	O
Doing some some little shading things, but I've been really trying to.	O
Use some harder edge brushes in my portrait painting is it forces me to make better decisions about those things.	O
Don't like drawing eyes 'cause I can't make it symmetric.	O
That's really hard, isn't it?	CHITCHAT
Well, if you're drawing if you're using if the porch, it's like straight on like this.	O
I guess you could use the symmetry tool in Photoshop to make it perfect, but yeah, from the side these kinds of angles I do find it really tough to do that.	O
I on the far side of the face, this one and this one is tricky.	O
But you know?	CHITCHAT
We just gotta keep practicing.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to switch my airbrush, my everything to an airbrush to.	O
So down here, for example, I'm going to make a selection.	O
Of the nose of the area outside the nose and then I can use the Airbrush.	O
The kind of soften and blend that area.	O
I can also select the inverse if I want to work on the nose.	O
Should try harder brushes too.	O
Yeah, it's nice because you can always go back in with the airbrush or a smudge brush and soften things a little bit, but in the early stages if you use a brush with little bit harder edge it helps you to make more.	O
You know strong shapes.	O
So she is wearing it just this year with an earring.	O
Gold earring looks like and I like the shininess.	O
The texture of that compared with the hair and the skin it's.	O
Nice effect I think so.	O
Let's paint that in.	O
Always blur the faces.	O
I think that's a very very common feeling.	O
I used to have very airbrushed looking faces.	O
But you know, it's not always bad.	O
It kind of depends on what style you're going for.	O
But I do think some hard edges are needed for successful successful image.	O
Some hard edges are needed.	O
Even if you have a soft.	O
Don't like drawn portraits anyways?	O
Hey, that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Hey Mohammed.	CHITCHAT
Ah well, thanks for coming over here.	CHITCHAT
I'll be doing some traditional painting on Twitch tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
So I've been looking forward to doing these portraits.	CHITCHAT
So I wanted to make it look like she's looking at us.	O
Sometimes that's a tricky thing.	O
So in the reference, you'll notice that the.	O

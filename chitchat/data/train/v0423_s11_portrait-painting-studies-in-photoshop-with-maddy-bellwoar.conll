Foster get to see you good morning.	CHITCHAT
And thank you, I really like this reference image.	O
The lighting turned out to be a little tricky.	O
But I guess that's also what makes it nice.	O
Salinas is a usually start drawing faces from full moons.	O
Drawing it is easy to give form with the lights and shadows and want to draw other parts of the face.	O
The nose says like a quality check.	O
That's so funny.	CHITCHAT
Well I know for a lot of people noses like the least favorite part of the phase do paint.	O
So I think that's cool tackling that one first getting it out of the way.	O
No, you do you know at that point you know that parts good and.	O
Yeah, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
What kind of the opposite of what I was doing with saving the eyes for, you know, saving my favorite part for last.	O
Doing the least favorite part first and getting another way.	O
Alright, I want to have this.	O
The cheek a little bit more defined here.	O
So I keep merging the layers down as soon as I paint some area for awhile and I feel like I like the progress.	O
I'll just merge it down.	O
So I don't really have a bunch of layers, I just have this one layer and then whenever I want to do more, just make a new one.	O
Work there for awhile and then merge down.	O
I could paint right on the layer, but I like the sort of security of being able to turn it on and off and say like.	O
I like where this is going sometimes, you know.	O
You work on something for a while and then realize that kinda like the previous version, which is a little sad, but it can happen.	O
So then you can turn back.	O
Alright, this shame needs a little bit of work.	O
I think if likeness wise her chin is really matching up.	O
That part is good.	O
Make everything else look as good as that.	O
I'm very close to the way to think about it.	O
Yeah, that's what I'm trying to capture is that little?	O
Indentation.	O
Model, but it's there.	O
One thing that's a little strange to me is like in my painting, I feel like I made it look like she's hunched over a little bit more than she is in the original, and I think that has to do with.	O
The the angle of her neck and everything.	O
So I'm going to work on that a bit.	O
Now try to make it look like shoes.	O
Yeah, work on her positioning little bit.	O
Maybe that helps a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to.	O
Pay attention to where there is slightly different hues to the skin.	O
I feel like under the chin there's a little bit more like a yellow or even.	O

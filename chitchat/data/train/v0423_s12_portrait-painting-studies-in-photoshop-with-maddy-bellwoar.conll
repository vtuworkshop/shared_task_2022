Towards the green here to the skin tone.	O
Whereas up by the cheeks it's like more pink.	O
For example, there's like these slight little differences.	O
And is taking me along.	O
It's taken me awhile to start noticing them and just.	O
I think part of it is just making the habit of really like looking and asking yourself 'cause I used to kind of just choose one sort of, you know, color that represented the skin tone, like in her case I'd choose like Peachy color and then when I was doing the shading I would make everything just like a darker or lighter version of that.	O
But there really are a lot of different hues.	O
And it will be more interesting and lively skin if you pay attention to those things.	O
Love to work with the Navigator in Photoshop makes it easy not to zoom out.	O
That's a good tip.	CHITCHAT
I actually have my navigator window open right now, just on my other monitor.	O
It really helps.	CHITCHAT
I still I still zoom out sometimes, but.	O
I usually I do like to keep this window open.	O
I have it next to the chat on my other matter monitor.	O
Some people, instead of having the Navigator window open, they prefer to open the same like a second version of the document.	O
I kind of just go with the Navigator window soon enough for me.	O
I totally agree.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to turn into black and white and look at it one more time.	O
They've done something a little off with her eyebrow shape here.	O
Sometimes turning things into black-and-white also just gives you a fresh look at it and not just with things to do with values.	O
But sometimes you know you start noticing shapes and things 'cause it just looks different.	O
Things are.	CHITCHAT
We can suddenly notice things differently.	O
So I use the shortcut to turn everything into black and white.	O
If you uhm.	CHITCHAT
If you want to set it up for yourself, I can show you how to do it.	O
It's kind of like a one time thing, and then once you have it set up, it's really easy to use.	O
So you're in your in your windows, you just want to go to view in in your dropdown menu view proof setup.	O
Custom.	O
And then set your device to simulate to working great gain 20%.	O
You can see how it is right here.	O
Just press OK.	O
And then every time you press CTRL Y after that, it'll turn your painting the black-and-white it'll turn here at campus into black and white, and then you can still paint while it's in that format.	O
An it will color.	O
Pick the true color, even though it's only showing you the grayscale version and it's really nice.	O
You can't trust all grayscale like you can't just go in and desaturate your painting.	O
It will not present the values correctly, but if you do it this way then that should work for you.	O
Which they had navigator for illustrator.	O
All they don't.	O
That's interesting.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know that I don't really use illustrator.	O
Because I I don't work in vector usually do all raster painting.	O
But that's curious.	O
I wonder if they'll add it in the future.	O
It seems like it could be useful there as well.	O
I want to work on the shadows over on the far side of the portrait.	O
Even though it seems like she kind of like dissolves into the shadows, it's not quite that simple.	O
There's still areas that are dark and more darker, more contrast.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then some literary's highlights in the hairs go a little brighter.	O
Skin tones are difficult to capture correctly, at least for me.	O

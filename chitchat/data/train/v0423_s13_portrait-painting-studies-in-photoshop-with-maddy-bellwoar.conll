Your colors look great.	CHITCHAT
Thank you foster.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, skin tone.	O
Skin colors are.	O
Are tricky.	O
There's some.	CHITCHAT
There's an artist that I've been getting a lot of inspiration from lately that I can share with you guys in the chat.	CHITCHAT
She doesn't really experimental an interesting colors with her painting, but her portraits are just so good.	CHITCHAT
Her name is Shaq Curry.	CHITCHAT
A post, a link to one of her paintings in the chat for you guys to check out if you like.	CHITCHAT
For some color inspiration.	CHITCHAT
She doesn't, she pushes the.	CHITCHAT
He pushes the colors into a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Almost fantasy realm.	CHITCHAT
Then what I do, but I've been.	CHITCHAT
Inspired by how far she goes with it.	CHITCHAT
And that makes me want to bring more Hughes into my skin as well.	CHITCHAT
Instead of like I was saying earlier, I used to kind of just pick the one skin color and then I had a very.	O
Yeah, we just kind of added lighter and darker versions by color and I'm trying to open my mind to all the real colors that are in the skin because it really is all over the place.	O
Oh, I'm sorry about that, Alina.	CHITCHAT
There is a bit of a delay here.	CHITCHAT
It's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not any problem on your end.	CHITCHAT
It is something that there that is working to improve and it has actually improved a bit from the time that I first started streaming here.	CHITCHAT
But there is a little bit of a delay.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
I want to get this shadow in the corner of the mouth.	O
And I'm really thinking about switching to the airbrush for this.	O
Let's try it out.	CHITCHAT
So it's quite a dark shadow right at the corner there.	O
And then it kind of fades off into more of a natural skin tone color.	O
I don't like that.	CHITCHAT
So using the.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Lasso tool to create like a stencil kind of approach.	O
For that shadow.	O
Maybe it's a bit too dark.	O
But we'll see after I add some more, I want to add a few other shadows.	O
Maybe it'll fit in after I do that.	O
Yeah, so just left in that a little bit emerge it down.	O
So we have about like a little bit under 30 minutes left to work on this.	CHITCHAT
Or at least that's what I'm going to try to stick to.	CHITCHAT
You guys are welcome to take more time if you are painting along on this one.	CHITCHAT
Now you're welcome to take as much time as you want, of course, but.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
As far as if you wanted to like share what you did today with us long streaming, yeah you can continue to work on this one.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to work on that couple other paintings after this one.	CHITCHAT
So you're welcome to keep working and just share it whenever it's.	CHITCHAT

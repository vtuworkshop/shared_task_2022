It has a little bit of pressure sensitivity, so even if I put it at 100% pure white, it's not going to really 100% pure white.	O
If you go back in color pic.	O
It's a little bit see through.	O
Hey Sam and thanks for coming by.	O
I hope you're having a good day.	O
We're doing portraits today.	O
Sometimes it's fun to make a little shine and then erase out in there.	O
It gives the impression of you know whatever light is reflecting in the eye.	O
It could be a window.	O
There could be a couple panels that could be, you know, just gives a little bit of that.	O
Kind of affect.	O
Look at the line for the eyelid over here.	O
So let's look at it in black-and-white one more time.	O

I hope you're having good weather.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty nice here, it's just getting a little.	CHITCHAT
Get a little post.	O
Let me grab the hair brush.	O
Thank you faster.	CHITCHAT
Yes, so today I used a combination of brushes I used.	O
That soft shading and blending from my free set and then I used one of my brushes.	O
That's like sort of a modified version of that brush, but it's very similar.	O
It's inspired by it.	O
And I like them both together 'cause I can kind of start off with one brush.	O
Looks a little bit.	O
More soft and then get more precise, but you could certainly do this with a hard round brush, an airbrush combo.	O

Transitions from her lip to the skin.	O
Feel like it looks a little bit more natural in the photo or mines a bit too much hard edge line so I'm just going to use the.	O
Smite brush do as much that away a little bit.	O
She has a little bit of.	O
Lower detail in the lower lashes, but I don't know if that will work out for me if I if I paid that or if it's going to like look creepy, sometimes it can be, but that too much.	O
So it's nice with a smile.	O
I know I tend to like you sometimes give my portraits little bit more of a happy expression.	O
There's a little bit to something where when you.	O

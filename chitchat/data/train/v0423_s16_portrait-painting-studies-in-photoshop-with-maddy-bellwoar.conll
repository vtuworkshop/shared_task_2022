When you draw someone or paint someone with a certain expression, you kind of like try to imitate it yourself a little bit.	O
I've seen some funny memes, like jokes going on about this online.	O
I don't know if you guys have seen them, but.	O
Sarah Sarah scribbles a comic.	O
That has a really funny picture of like the artist drawing and like making the same face is the person she's drawing.	O
It's like some crazy face 'cause she's doing a battle scene or something.	O
But it's so true.	O
I find that I tend to do that to you sometimes if I'm drawing someone is like I notice that all this, and I'll be like doing their face expression.	O
Hey John, welcome.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I've ever ever done that on stream.	O
Certainly notice that happening one time.	O
I'm actually going to use liquify for a moment here to work on the eye shape.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh that's Sweet Alena.	CHITCHAT
You guys are welcome to paint me if you want.	CHITCHAT
Like that's totally cool.	CHITCHAT
I don't know that.	O
That I'm staying in the same position for long enough 'cause I'm kind of like turning my head, but if you want to you can.	O
So ideally I would have fainted.	O
These eyes correctly from the start.	O
Wouldn't need to do liquify, but.	O
We are using digital tools, so I'm not going to be afraid.	O
To make some little edits.	O
But it's up to you.	O
If you are really looking to practice anatomy or whatnot, it's probably a good practice to go ahead and paint over mistakes.	O
So it just depends, you know if you're doing if you're doing a study, then I think painting over the mistakes and trying to work things out is beneficial.	O
If you are doing client work and you gotta get done and you want it to be good, then I think you know use whatever tools get the job done.	O
But honestly, sometimes I find that.	O
Using liquefy can help me notice what's wrong 'cause I'm not overly.	O
I haven't really figured out what's wrong yet and I'll take liquefying kind of like move things around and then suddenly it'll be like OK, that's where it needs to be.	O
So that's interesting thing.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I can help.	CHITCHAT
You see Jackson.	CHITCHAT
Oh it's scary.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool enough.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for letting me know.	CHITCHAT
Here I am.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy you think so.	CHITCHAT
I had to go through a few ugly moment in this painting.	O
I really like the I really like this process.	CHITCHAT
The like the workflow that I have for these with just kind of starting out blocking things in having to be messy at the start because by the time you get finished do you do have a?	O
I think a pretty nice effect of.	CHITCHAT
Like more detail in the face less detail elsewhere, it's kind of a painterly look.	O
Of course, I should probably do a little bit more with the hair.	O
This is a bit.	O
That that low effort her.	O
But anyway I am like.	CHITCHAT
Overall, I think there's there's definitely improvement to be made, but I like this workflows.	O
So I think I'm going to be continuing with this even though it has a messy beginning.	O
Sometimes that can be.	O
Little hard but.	O
Um, I'm going to put on.	O
I'm going to try a layer on color Dodge.	O
Because I want to give a little shine to the ear here.	O
Yeah, the ring.	O
Just a little bit.	O
I just love how color Dodge looks on gold stuff.	O
It just really it's wonderful thing magic.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try a multiply layer to add a little bit more shadows, so I'm just using an airbrush.	O
We got real big brush, real big round brush.	O
Right, so so sorry, no ugly moments along the way.	O
You're doing it wrong.	O
Or maybe that's just me convincing myself.	O

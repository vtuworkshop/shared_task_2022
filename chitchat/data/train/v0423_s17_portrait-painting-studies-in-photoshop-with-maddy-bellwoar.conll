Is that rare painting that it doesn't go through the ugly stage?	O
I think that happens to me like it's like once in a blue moon.	O
That painting looks good in all phases.	O
Such avera situation.	O
He hung welcome.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at the hairline here.	O
So um, shoot her hair is parted here so there's a little bit of you can see.	O
Up in between the where the part is a little bit.	O
And there's a little bit of a shine.	O
On the hair just slightly.	O
Read says I tried this workflow multiple times, but there's too much ugly stages when I'm doing it.	O
I'm struggling to go further so just abandoned that workflow.	O
It's a really ugly at the start.	O
At least I felt that way.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
I don't blame you, I blame you and you know, like we all have our different workflows.	CHITCHAT
We gotta find what you like.	CHITCHAT
What's right for you?	CHITCHAT
But I do like the style that you can get.	O
In the end, more and more towards the end.	O
Results.	O
Steven says I saw a film of the animators working on Snow White as well as stills and film reference of an actress and costume.	O
They would have a mirror next to them and imitate big, fresh and they wanted to draw that.	O
So cool, odd that makes sense, but.	O
It's interesting, is interesting.	O
It's good to know that stuff because it's a perfect example of like, I think sometimes have people have the.	O
Misconception that somehow these artists are just.	O
Just know all this stuff in there just doing it all from scratch an I mean they might be drawing from scratch, but.	O
You know they have all this research to help them do a good job and you know those animators, they know how to draw people they know how to draw people and animals and all that good stuff, but they're still using all that references to get the best, most accurate result they can.	O
So that goes to show how important it is to use reference.	O
Expect multiple other stages is really good to have.	O
That kind of expectations, realistic expectations.	O
I really hope it helps not be discouraged.	O
Do you trust the process you like?	O
Alright?	CHITCHAT
I know that I just gotta go through this.	O
I will highlight to live here.	O
Yeah, so it'll raise a couple things that I did.	O
Going to take the smudge brush and just move a couple areas.	O
Get some more last edges, soft hair.	O
Brian.	CHITCHAT
You do great work.	CHITCHAT
Tell me then.	CHITCHAT
Trying to add a little bit of more shading on the side of her face, but I don't want it to look dirty.	O
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to make it look like there's shadow, not like there's some dirt on her like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Lips need to be smaller on the side too.	O
And then then you layer on multiplying try one more time with shadows going a little bit deeper on this side.	O
Hopefully not getting too muddy colors.	O

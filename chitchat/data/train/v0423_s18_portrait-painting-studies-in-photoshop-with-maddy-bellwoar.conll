Lower the opacity a little bit.	O
So if anybody's painting along on this one, there's about 5 minutes left.	CHITCHAT
Before I'm going to end my you're welcome to keep going.	CHITCHAT
On years, by the way.	CHITCHAT
Trick is to make sure that ugly stages are before the painting is finished.	O
Very good point.	O
So we're going to do another painting after this is actually going to be a guy portrait of a guy.	O
I tend to prefer painting women for some reason, so I know that I have a bit of a bias towards that, so I want to make sure we we paint.	O
Ciety of portraits.	O
So we're going to die after this.	O
And then another lady, so I hope you will join in for one if you like.	O
Hum, trying to side by making it look more or less like are.	O
Overall, I'm happy with the style of his portrait.	O
I don't think I.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I nailed the likeness.	O
I think we can tell that it's meant to be her butt.	O
Not quite exactly her.	O
But that's OK.	O
And it's alright for practice.	O
In between portraits, I'm going to take a quick break.	O
And get a drink and maybe open my my window if it's getting it warm inside.	O
Here, what happens when you're asking the computer?	O
Tablets little toasty in summer.	O
She was wearing a necklace also.	O
I kind of disregarded that.	O
We could add it, I'm not sure it's very important.	O
Trying to deep in the shadow under the channel little bit.	O
That'll more hair.	O
I like the lighting in the portrait as well as the styling of her hair.	O
She has like a classical look somehow.	O
Do you have a favorite portraitist painter?	CHITCHAT
Actually, I was just showing of- Checker ease work earlier.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to post her up a sample of your work in the chat real quick.	CHITCHAT
She is amazing.	CHITCHAT
Here's one of her boyfriends.	CHITCHAT
She's been inspiring me a lot because she does beautiful likenesses, but she pushes the color in my opinion, to like a little bit more almost fantasy feeling.	CHITCHAT
But it's not fantasy.	CHITCHAT
It still believable and realistic in a way, but it's just.	CHITCHAT
She really pushes the colors into something special, so she inspires me a lot.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I really like how Nathan Fox does.	CHITCHAT
Charcoal portraits.	CHITCHAT
Huge simplifies with these sweeping strokes, which is kind of like I'm trying to get that a little bit of that approach.	CHITCHAT
What I'm doing here let me see if I can find a quick sample.	O
Of his charcoal stuff.	O
I mean, it's unreal how good he is here.	O
Let me show.	CHITCHAT
So this is an example of his charcoal work, so you can see how strong the shapes are.	O

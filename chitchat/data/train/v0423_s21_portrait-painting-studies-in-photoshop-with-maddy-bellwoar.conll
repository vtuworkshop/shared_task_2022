Ryan says it's funny how traditional artists have a traverse gun can devalue hundreds of years ago.	CHITCHAT
Yet in 3D, arguably I don't think it's been achieved yet.	CHITCHAT
I understand what you mean.	CHITCHAT
I understand what you mean, definitely.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's certain styles that I really like, but I also feel like it's not very, very fine line between creepy and cool.	CHITCHAT
3DS spectacularly difficult.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I do not.	CHITCHAT
That is outside my realm.	CHITCHAT
I just I appreciate 3D stuff, but beyond that I don't really know much.	CHITCHAT
All right guys, we're going to move on to the next portrait, so I will keep this one.	O
Yeah, this one is saved.	O
Um, Oh yeah, this was the reference.	O
OK, we can close that.	O
Well, get all set up for the new one.	O
So we're going to do the next.	O
The very next portrait is.	O
Eh?	CHITCHAT
This guy, who has a little bit of a lighter background, so I think that's going to be easier because the last one, the hair was really blending into the background.	O
This one should be a little bit easier that way.	O
I like the strong shapes in the face.	O
I think this one could do really well for like a stylized version.	O
I'm going to be still painting the same way as the one before, but yeah, I thought it was interesting shapes.	O
Hey fish and thank you.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Also, Speaking of Sergeant, I did a master study of one of his portraits.	CHITCHAT
It was too much to take in at the time, all at the same time, not only his colors.	CHITCHAT
Values are great but brushwork is crazy.	CHITCHAT
Good gosh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I haven't other.	CHITCHAT
I tried one to do a master study of one of his watercolors like it was a few years ago and I stopped halfway through so maybe I could try it again.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
Thank you John, I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
So this is going to be another one where we will do in an hour and a half and see what we can do.	O
Maybe it maybe I'm more warmed up now after the first one.	O
So OK, let's make and you.	O
Canvas.	O
And let's see how big is this?	CHITCHAT
Wow, that's very low res.	O
Let's let's get a little bigger.	O
Let's see 2500 pixels.	O
Probably not going to print this.	O
Just to study so we can make it relatively small.	O
30 2.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think were ready.	CHITCHAT
So let's make and you were going to do an hour and a half again.	O
I'm going to talk through my process, but if you guys have any questions you're welcome to ask.	O
Be happy to show.	CHITCHAT
Anything if I know how to do it.	O
If you if you have any specific techniques, things like that you're interested in, I could try.	O
Publicis recently found out there's a timer built into windows.	O
Oh cool, nice thank you.	CHITCHAT
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll try it out.	CHITCHAT
I'm working with my boyfriend's working on creating this plugin for photo shop, so I'm trying to test it out.	O
Find a find issues here and there.	O
OK, so I I usually like to start with a sketch, but lately I don't know if that's really been helping.	O
I feel like I could just maybe go in with shape, so that's kind of what I ended up doing with the last one, and that seemed to be better so.	O
So for example, I picked a color for the background that looks similar to what?	O
Going on back there, it looks like he is standing in front of it.	O
Looks like outdoor this is like outdoors and this light shining through this little opening.	O
Some kind of patio type thing.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I could be totally wrong.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't really matter what it is.	O
I'm probably going to make the background allow more abstract than it actually is and just kind of put some shapes and light back here and not worry about it.	O
I think the key thing is that the light coming from behind and we can have a nice glow back there and then do our porch on top.	O
And that will be good.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so new layer, good luck to you and everyone painting along.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Fish in thank you thank you.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT

I will take it.	CHITCHAT
I will take the look.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to try to block in big to small shapes so.	O
Let's begin with.	O
Our body hears this is all.	O
This darkish blue with a little bit of a teal kind of tint to it and some of the highlights, but we'll get to that.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
I will block in the.	O
Skin.	O
Not really the right shade, but we'll just.	O
We'll just put it in there and get started.	O
So I'm in the phase where I'm just kind of like imagining that I'm putting big globs of paint on the canvas.	O
If this was a traditional, which is kind of putting the paint in relatively the right place, and then we're going to work from.	O
Vague too from like rough to specific on these things.	O
Start out.	O
A bit messy.	CHITCHAT
So this kind of brush really helps me to make strong shapes.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I don't know that any of these shapes are remarkably strong, but you can see what I mean about the hard edges is kind of forces me to.	O
Commit to some kind of shapes because of the edges.	O
I think I'm just going to paint him right onto the background because the background is not anything complicated that I'm going to have to go back and want to be able to move them around without messing up the background.	O
It's just like that.	O
I'm going to go with this kind of flat color, so I think it's going to be easier for me to be able to quickly color, pick and cut into shape if I want, so I'm just going to paint it all in one.	O
Layer.	O
So what I am trying to trying to look at our.	O
Basic shapes of the head and proportion, so we've got almost like a rectangle for the head first, and then it sort of cuts in.	O
So where does the jawline start?	O
Where is this curve take place and it's above the like the shoulder kind of points up to it.	O
So get something like that.	O
And then over here the shoulder is lower.	O
So I kind of I try to use.	O
To make things parts of body work in relationship to where I paint something else.	O
So that kind of helps.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to think it's attire.	O
Is it slower?	O
And then there's a white shirt.	O
So we've got this sharp triangle shape upside down triangle.	O
And we always slip.	O
I gave her quite a swoop.	O
It's kinda funny when I flip it like this is like very obvious.	O
Have to go with my senior paint for a bit, mattie by our thanks for hanging out for a bit.	O
Have a great rest of your day, will see you soon.	O
So I've been painting this kind of like a graphic style almost at the beginning here.	O
Let's get in some more colors and things.	O
So new layer.	O
Sometimes I like to color pic from my curtain current colour and then move it from there to get a new color.	O
So it doesn't seem so random.	O
If I find that I make colors that feel a little bit more cohesive to my painting.	O
If I do this.	O
So there's a little bit of a warmer color to the skin on the face here too, and let's work on placement of like eyebrows and things so.	O
So we can be on the same line as our reference up here.	O
Look up.	O
Eyebrows Guys here.	O
God knows.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
Funny.	CHITCHAT
So just keep in mind like how it's.	O
We're kind of just putting the placement of things now.	O
So I would really.	O
Like I hope it helps to see this process and know that like the early stages.	O

Uh, something like this?	CHITCHAT
How kind of silly that it looks, relatively speaking compared to like the photo.	O
If you look like we're going to look at what we're going for.	O
So please don't give up if you feel like you're starting up portrait or starting something and you're like, Oh my gosh, I can't do this.	O
You gotta build up off of it.	O
Maybe, maybe someday you know.	O
I mean, I think as as you improve, I think that it helps.	O
The earlier stages.	O
Will you kind of work through the earlier stages.	O
More quickly I guess.	O
But yeah, 'cause it doesn't matter.	O
How experienced you are the early stages are going to be.	O
Be a little rough.	O
But yeah, so right now I'm just working on.	O
I've heard people say that you're kind of thinking about it out.	O
If you are like squinting your eyes or something like that.	O
I don't really like to do that.	O
'cause it kind of gives me a headache, but I get the idea.	O
Or like if you wear glasses for example.	O
It's like.	CHITCHAT
If you took off your glasses, I guess that depends on what your prescription is, but you want imagine like a slightly blurred version of.	O
The reference when you're starting out, and if you're if you're working in this workflow, there's a lot of other ways to work.	O
You could certainly go with a process where you kind of make a very detailed sketch or drawing and work from that.	O
That's one way to do it.	O
This picture has a little bit of like a blue tint to it.	O
All of the dark shadows in this picture feel a little bit shifted towards blue.	O
That might be some kind of post processing thing with the photo.	O
I generally try not to choose photos that have too much.	O
Filter or tinting or anything like that to them.	O
'cause I find it difficult but I really, really liked the shapes in this portrait so I thought I would do it anyway.	O
And those facial hair.	O
So this should be a good challenge.	O
Up, I'm just going to paint this area darker.	O
I'm going to treat the facial hair like.	O
I don't know that it's creating a shadow kind of look.	O
I'm not going to draw individual hairs yet, but we might get in there and do some magic individual hairs.	O
But we're just going to right now.	O
Kind of give again as if we're looking at this as a bit blurry, just whereas the where the shadows were the lighter areas.	O
So the hair under the nose above the mouth sound like this.	O
You gotta nostrils.	O
Here and here.	CHITCHAT
And if you're if you're questioning if you're putting things in the right place.	O
Keep an eye on your reference.	O
For example, just been not words.	O
What does the nostril lineup with?	O
If you go directly up or down?	O
The natural kind of the circular inside of the natural kind of lines up with the edge of the eye.	O
Roughly.	O
So you can keep that.	O
Keep looking at those landmarks to check our proportion and like locations of things.	O
Alright, let's figure out the lips.	O
'cause I'm wondering, maybe I didn't give enough room for the lips.	O
Top lip is kind of disappearing right now.	O
So let's forget about how I need to move some things around it.	O
But look, he's starting to come out of.	O
Who the blurriness of faces forming from the blurriness?	O
So let's find the corners of the mouth.	O
We can bring those down from.	O
Center of the I.	O
You got pretty serious expression.	O
Steven says if I take off my glasses I wouldn't be able to see the reference at all and we're just walked into warm room from outside and glasses missed something exactly.	O
Yeah, yeah exactly.	CHITCHAT
It's all relative, I guess if you have the perfect prescription of yeah, then it it could work, but.	O

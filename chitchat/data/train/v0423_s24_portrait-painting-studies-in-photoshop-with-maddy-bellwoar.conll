I have a relatively low prescription.	O
I do have glasses and Contacts that I wear if I if I'm going to be driving or.	O
Need to look at things at a distance.	O
I'm nearsighted so everything like around me.	O
When I'm, you know, at home or something like that everything is like I can see well enough.	O
But I think I think I need a new prescription actually.	O
Haven't had I've had my glasses for maybe four or five years now and I think I'm starting to feel that I needed new one.	O
It'll like no.	O
Makes sense that the hairs would create a shadow effect.	O
Then here on top.	O
Yeah yeah Foster.	O
I'm trying to think about it that way and it's so far is going better than when I've tried to paint individual hairs in the past.	O
It's so strange because.	O
That's actually more work to go in and paint all the hairs, and it's kind of sad that it's kind of ironic that it's like more work, but I feel like it looks better to not do it, but that's a great news.	O
Realize it.	O
If you're going for hyper realism then of course, or if you're going to get really detailed in the end, you can go in and pay more hairs, but kind of nice that you can give the impression without.	O
Going in and doing all that.	O
Alright, so.	O
The lips I still feel like I haven't given enough room for the lips.	O
Maybe I need to just.	O
Like bring down the channel bit more of the jaw.	O
So for example, I'm going to make a selection.	O
Here we go.	O
Layer new layer via copy or control J and just kind of.	O
Bring that down.	O
Give him allergic chin.	O
I just feel like I didn't leave enough room to actually put the.	O
Lips and their kind of cramped so it gets a little better.	O
There's not much of a change.	O
But OK, good.	O
Let's try again with the corners of the mouth is going to go a little lower.	O
Good morning from Brazil.	O
Good morning Nathan welcome.	O
I hope you're having a good day so far.	O
Um?	O
Let's get the skin around the lips in the right shape and then maybe.	O
That will help bring out the lip shape.	O
So for example, you see this highlight on the skin right around the lips like sort of between the facial hair where it sort of papers off.	O
There's some areas where the hairs slightly left.	O
Hi Nicholas, good day from Australia welcome.	O

But I appreciate you being here.	O
We did a painting before this one.	O
That's this one right here.	O
And this was about an hour and a half, so we're doing our onehalf studies today.	O
Trying to squeeze in three of those.	O
So he's looking over to the right.	O
Let's get some whites of the eyes in although.	O
Because he's looking.	O
We're kind of looking at him.	O
He's looking down a little bit, not straight down, but kind of.	O
Little bit down we're seeing his eyelashes come over the eyes so we see a little white set eyes.	O
But there a bit obscured.	O
It's not going to be super Super Bright.	O
And we're going to see the eyelid will increase.	O
So I think I've made his eyes look like he's going looking a little too far to the right.	O
We do see why it's the eyes on the right, both in both eyes so.	O

That should fix that.	O
I really like portraits where the.	O
You get an unusual angle on the eyes like this.	O
I think it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm let me show the reference up close real quick so you guys can see what I'm talking about.	O
I really like how.	O
We get this angle, so it's not just like that traditional shape of the eye that you always see.	O
If the person is looking at you is something a little bit more interesting things.	O
So let's take a look at that.	O
Never been able to squint when I try my right eye closes altogether.	O
I just always found whenever I tried to do that whole squint squinting to see the reference without.	O
And other details that it just gives me a headache.	O
It really doesn't make me feel well to like, squint across my eyes or anything so I don't bother with it, but you can.	O
In photo shop you can put a blur filter on your reference or something like that if you really want to have that experience without the headache, so that's that's nice.	O
Can put a filter on it.	O
Alright, let's get a shadow or highlight mean to say on the nose.	O
The lighter Noses are probably my least favorite part of the face to paint.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't hate it, but it's just I find the lip shapes in the eye is like more satisfying and I kind of just feel like I have to get through the.	O
I'm waiting at the lowest.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
We are, it says I don't bother squinting.	CHITCHAT
Well, whatever you do, it works out just fine.	CHITCHAT
Everything is one big blur anyhow.	CHITCHAT
Do you need new glasses like me?	CHITCHAT
Hey Norman, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for joining us.	CHITCHAT
So I'm kind of slowly getting darker and darker with the details.	O
I was getting more contrast.	O
The lighter and darker.	O
I'm trying to pay note around the.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Eyebrows there's little highlights.	O
I feel like I've made him look like he's raising his eyebrows like he's given a look like.	O
You know what I'm saying?	O
I probably need to lower them a little bit.	O
Alright, So what will do is looking at proportions.	O
I think I'm going to make a selection of the eyes.	O
And just copy that onto a new layer again with control J.	O
Try that again.	O
So make a selection layer new layer via copy.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So now I can move the eyes up 'cause I think there's an issue.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Or I can move the the eyebrows down trying to figure out which what was the things out of place here.	O
Something down please.	O
Which one is it?	CHITCHAT
So I think moving the moving the eyebrows down is better because.	O
The other parts of the face seemed to be an OK proportion.	O
An Ollie I'm sorry it sounds a bit annoying, stuck between a rock and a hard place.	CHITCHAT

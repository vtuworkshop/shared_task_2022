Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
I hope you find solution for it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so below the nodes there's a little bit more shadow here under the nostrils.	O
So hopefully that'll make the nose look like it's kind of popping out a little bit more.	O
Let's establish the outside of the nose shape.	O
Apps.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's slip.	CHITCHAT
I would be pretty happy if I could end up getting a decent likeness to this.	O
Portrait.	O
We'll see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
So it's a little bit more color to the lips than what I have to add that.	O
And try to pay attention through nuances like I think towards the center of the lip or the tulips meet.	O
There's a little bit more of a reddish saturated color and then towards the edges.	O
It's a little bit cooler, the lid color.	O
I think is normal.	O
Standard lip stuff.	O
I like to turn the layer on and off after I've done some work to kind of check on it, so make sure I'm going in the right direction.	O
Sometimes it's satisfying, other times you realize this.	O
And fix that.	CHITCHAT
So I think we're doing alright.	CHITCHAT
You guys are cracking me up.	CHITCHAT
I have that stuff happening too and I'm like.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I sleep in a weird angle.	CHITCHAT
And get some random neck pain or something.	CHITCHAT
Mostly it doesn't happen that too often, but it does happen.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think I need to work on the.	O
The eyes hi ash can please tell the brushes you would use in this.	O
That is a good question I.	O
Have been sticking to a couple brushes actually.	O
If you want you can download some brushes for free below my stream.	O
In the description there's a pack that you can download and one of them has a brush called soft shading and blending.	O
It looks like this.	CHITCHAT
And this is the type of brush that I've been painting.	O
Almost, you know, the whole painting with so far.	O
I recently made like a modified version of that brush that looks like this.	O
It's literally almost exactly same brush.	O
It's like a little bit less transparent, but it's like basically the same brush.	O
So if you want a brush that functions like what I'm doing here you can download it for free.	O
It's the soft shading and blending brush in the painterly brush set.	O
There's a link to it below.	O
And I've actually been using this brush so far.	O
That's the only brush I've used for this painting an I think that it really makes a difference to use one brush like that I have.	O
I will also use a an airbrush to do some shading and stuff, especially if I want to like use a layer on multiply an just add like a soft area of shadow across part of the face or something like that.	O
I will use use an airbrush, but almost all of this is.	O
With this one brush, I like this brush because it has.	O
One soft edge and one hard edge so you can get hard edges, which is important, but you also get that one edge that softly dissolves into the rest of the painting, and I think it makes a nice painterly kind of feeling.	O

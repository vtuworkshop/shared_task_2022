But the key is you have to be willing to kind of push through the ugly stages in a painting because I found that this workflow using the one brush the whole time.	O
If you kind of start off and things don't necessarily look great at the beginning, but you gotta keep painting over.	O
From like the rough look at the start and just keep painting over until things look better.	O
Alright, so adding little shadow under the list there's.	O
Little shadow there and her growing.	O
The other brush that I like to use a lot for this is a smudge brush so that brushes in the pack two so you would.	O
Click the little finger.	O
Much brush icon and then select the brush that you want to use as your smudge brush.	O
Again.	CHITCHAT
There's one in the pack.	O
I like to use it in anywhere between 10 and 30% strength.	O
Usually you'll see it behaves differently depending on the string and you can use this to smudge and blur away.	O
Hard edges if you are using this kind of brush and the hard edges are too much somewhere, you can just nudge that out.	O
Oh, you're welcome yash.	O
I hope you enjoy the brushes.	O
There's a lot of other brushes in that pack that I really like that are.	O
Sort of different that this one.	O
Like a style we're doing, here is a bit more like smooth.	O
There's a lot of textured brushes in that package or nice for other things.	O
OK, so I'm going to merge down what I did so far on to one layer.	O
Actually.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's do it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a new layer and start adding a next next level of shadows is right now.	O
Things are pretty were missing that deep contrast servicing deep shadows, so the wrinkles in the shirt shadows where the collar meets up with the skin and stuff like that.	O
So this might be a good time to use multiply.	O
We can try it anyway.	O
It doesn't look good.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to normal layer, but I'm putting this layer on multiply mode.	O
In that way.	O
Whatever we paint, this is a layer on.	O
Multiply it a little, paint over what's already there, but it won't like you wipe it out.	O
It's not like painting on a regular layer.	O
You can still see through it a little bit.	O
Not sure how that's going to work on the clothing though.	O
It's a flat layers.	O
Doesn't really matter if we use multiplies.	O
I think I will do the clothes on a regular layer, so if you see this type of shirt it seems like.	O
The edges.	O
Kind of get this lighter blue highlight.	O
Over here.	CHITCHAT
The edge is facing towards.	O
A light source, a little bit more, it seems like, so you get a whole area that's.	O
Brighter.	O
So I'm trying to stay zoomed out and look at this.	O
I mean you see I'm not going in and painting individual little tiny wrinkles.	O
Kind of trying to make a big sweeping brush strokes to just block in where the wrinkles are very large shaped.	O
And then we'll do min.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think it's getting a little bit better.	CHITCHAT

Sorry for this picture of cloud that was really random.	CHITCHAT
I quit.	CHITCHAT

Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
Please, please excuse.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
So random OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, hopefully I'll eventually post that soon because if you guys are gonna be Final Fantasy fans in here have an unfinished cloud fan art.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
But anyway, back to this guy.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit of a blue Sheen to the hair too, so it makes me feel like maybe there's some kind of filtering on this, but it does look cool.	O
I don't mind it.	CHITCHAT
So there's some warmer colors can shining through the hair too.	O
So we'll add those.	O
Keep things interesting.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT

Regularly scheduled painting sessions.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so bring them into darker shadows here.	O
I think it's good for the highest contrast areas to be near and around the face, 'cause That's going to bring contrast will draw RI.	O
Thank you for a designer.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate that I will.	CHITCHAT
It's been, it's been awhile.	CHITCHAT
I definitely will take a break.	CHITCHAT
I'm planning to.	CHITCHAT
Take a visit to some nature parks and forests near where I live.	CHITCHAT
That always makes me feel.	CHITCHAT
Rejuvenated and inspired.	CHITCHAT
I usually take lots of photos for painting and things like that, so maybe will do some environment paintings together when I get back and have lots of photos work from.	CHITCHAT
Probably just more a little bit more of like a staycation.	CHITCHAT
Steven, just because, well, because of all the covid stuff, I think it's probably for the best not to do any real extensive travels, but just taking a sort of a break from work for a little bit, Ann.	CHITCHAT
Make up to catch up on some personal projects.	CHITCHAT
Visit nature parks and forests.	CHITCHAT
I live in the Netherlands and there's a lot of beautiful places to see here, so will be staying in the country and just taking it easy, but hopefully spending a lot of time outside.	CHITCHAT

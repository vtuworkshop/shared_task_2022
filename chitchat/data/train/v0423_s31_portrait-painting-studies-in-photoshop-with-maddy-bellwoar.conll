Oh I see Pablos Yeah, so I don't have the H.	CHITCHAT
Oh I have the HD not before King.	CHITCHAT
I don't have the 4K tablet.	CHITCHAT
I've never tried one eye.	CHITCHAT
I'm, I think it's one of those things that I've got to avoid for awhile 'cause I'm like I'm like satisfied with mine now.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if I try to 4K one, I'm suddenly going to going to want to get that one.	CHITCHAT
Meanwhile, I'm very happy so I don't want to ruin it.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, thanks for Chiming in.	CHITCHAT
Guys, it's always nice to hear from people.	CHITCHAT
Have tried different ones and things.	CHITCHAT
For anyone who's looking, I think it can be helpful.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm gonna go back and work on my eyes again.	O
I've been bouncing around.	CHITCHAT
Saying I'm going to work on the eyes, but I end up doing other stuff so.	O
See, they're pretty pretty dark with a nice reflection of light.	O
She probably zoom in on my reference.	O
So something to look at when you're painting eyes is to notice the the people in iris.	O
How much of them?	CHITCHAT
How much of that part of the eye is like covered up by skin?	O
So for example, here you know if you draw the if you actually have the white space underneath, it's going to create a very very different effect than if it's just barely touching the skin, or if the skin is like coming up over it.	O
And so in this case.	O
Part of his eye is covered and you know that will affect the expression.	O
If someone has a little bit of Squint, or if the eyes wide open.	O
All that kind of stuff.	O
I'm going to give a little bit of a crease for the eyelid here.	O
And keep it pretty low.	O
And same thing over here.	O
There's a crease.	O
Something like that.	O
Alright, that's better.	CHITCHAT
I think that was a big thing that was missing.	O
I'm trying to work on painting the shapes around the.	O
But I thought she plywood.	O
Mike and stuff.	O
Still think my eyebrows are too high.	O
Well, how did they manage making them so high?	O
He looks like he's surprised so.	O
Alright, Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Eyebrow.	O
Adjustment Part 2.	O
So just bring him down.	O
It's great being able to do this.	O
I have to say.	O
Being is also a traditional painter.	O
It's really nice to not have to repaint something that's.	O
Working is it needs to move a little bit.	O
So yeah, I think that's a little better.	O
Merge went down.	O
Hey Homer, how are you?	CHITCHAT
So let's take a look at the corner of the eye.	CHITCHAT
But foreigners we've got a little bit of eyelashes kind of pointing down like this.	O
And there's also eyelashes coming down in front of the I.	O
I don't know if I'm going to include those or not.	O
Not sure how messy that's going to come across sometimes.	O
Get a lead out, little details 'cause.	O

Well that's our that's artist prerogatives inside.	O
But I like the corner on the shadow in the corner here.	O
Over here I think I got a little too.	O
Too far with the outward curve and bend of the lower eyelid so.	O
Bring that back.	O
In a little bit.	O
So I want to add the shadows under the eyelids without it making him look too good.	O
No tired.	CHITCHAT
Now it just looks curious, not surprised.	O
He's like what's going on over there.	O
I'm not sure what to do about that.	O
Just going to keep painting see what happens.	O
In the reference now, like looking at their original like let me show you now realize he looks a little bit like.	O
Actually, fairly like expressionless.	O
He's got pretty much of a stoic face.	O
Maybe looks a little disgusted.	O
I don't know, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
But I keep, I keep infusing different expressions into him that are not there.	O
So I was realizing just now that the house making it a classic mistake, you guys, the bottom of the nose was like not lining up properly with the top of the the lips like they should be perfectly like the, you know saying that op.	O
The center of the nose needs to line up perfectly with the center of the lips and the way I had it.	O
The lips were like.	O
A little bit.	O
Center the lips was a little bit to the left of the center of the nose, so I'm trying to fix that now.	O
That is something that usually.	O
Stands out more to me.	O
I didn't notice it, but.	O
It's good to have on your checklist of things to look for.	O
Funny how much eyebrows effect expression right expression is like Oh Man, I feel like it's like 90% I rose.	O
Of course.	CHITCHAT
Of course the mouth too, but.	O
Eyebrows are so much.	O

Pull pull it together.	O
Let's add some more shines in the eyes.	O
I think I tried that and ended up painting over it.	O
So we're going to add blue.	O
A blue shines coming from the left.	O
That's a lot.	O
It definitely makes the.	O
Makes the I look more rounded.	O
Ah thanks Judy Hey.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for popping in.	CHITCHAT
If anybody is either just getting here, or if you have to leave and are going to miss part of stream and you're interested, you can always.	CHITCHAT
Check it out later.	CHITCHAT
Any of my streams that I've done here?	CHITCHAT
They are available to re watch if you go to my profile and click on the video tab.	CHITCHAT
It has all my past streams.	CHITCHAT
And one really cool thing that the be hands has is this tool timeline.	CHITCHAT
So it captures the tools that I'm using as I use them and when you watch a replay it will show you the tools like the colours that I'm taking the name of the brushes and stuff like that.	O
If you find it hard to follow along.	O
Of course you can always ask me stuff if I do something.	O
Fast or you know, if you have any questions.	O
There's a little bit of a shadow here.	O
I think this is something that I'm missing that's a little bit of like a like a likeness thing for him to make it look more like him.	O
This shadow here.	O
Now I'm like making him look a little bit, maybe maybe a little older than than he is looking at the photo.	O
Partially.	O
That's what happened when you use when you use hard edge brush is.	O
So what I can do is duplicate this layer just so I can.	O
Go back if I don't like what I do, but I can take the smudge brush and blur out some of the details so the skin will appear a little bit smoother.	O
I do like the hard edges and I don't want to move them all out, but if you're depending on how old the person is your painting.	O
What look you're going for?	O
You might want to smooth out.	O
Yeah, I think that's a little better.	CHITCHAT
Hi RJ, welcome and thanks.	CHITCHAT
The other reference images are below the stream or about the chat info tab.	CHITCHAT
You can find the links.	CHITCHAT
In both places.	CHITCHAT
We're going to do 1 one more portrait after this one.	O
So if you guys are interested in seeing one from the beginning, if you're just getting here will start a new one soon.	O
Let me do some more work on the hair, I've been real.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Then ignoring the hair basically.	O
But for me, with the portrait is a lot more important to paint the the person that we can do, sort of like a rough.	O
Sort of fade out around the hair and get less.	O
Let's detailed.	O
Living the style is anyone painting along.	O
Thank you, Nicholas.	CHITCHAT
I hope so.	CHITCHAT
But it kind of depends from stream to stream.	CHITCHAT
People happen to have time to join in.	CHITCHAT
New to this, but definitely want to try this.	CHITCHAT
I would love that you guys are always always welcome to join me every time that I stream here I do a like a group session like this.	CHITCHAT
Today is going to be my last.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately it's my.	CHITCHAT
I have two weeks that it won't be streaming coming up.	CHITCHAT
Usually it's every single Wednesday, so the next two Wednesdays after this.	CHITCHAT
I won't be here, but then I'll be back to normal schedule of every Wednesday again.	CHITCHAT
But there's a bunch of past videos available in the meantime, let me check out what POV Lowe's is up to.	CHITCHAT

Yes Pablos.	CHITCHAT
OK guys, so this is not the one I'm working on of course, but in my discord server.	CHITCHAT
We are doing these group study sessions and our current topic is portraits.	CHITCHAT
This is one of the other references.	CHITCHAT
This is Great Pablos did you say?	CHITCHAT
Is this a work in progress?	CHITCHAT
Are you still working on it?	CHITCHAT
I painted a different art clip image.	O
Yeah, I was going to say 'cause it feels.	O
Well, I don't know if you're going to do more, but I kind of like how you stylize this.	O
It feels like it could be done.	O
You could go ahead and add more shading if you wanted to, but the style that you've done this in it feels like it could be complete like this.	O
I'm curious what you're up to, but.	CHITCHAT
Nice job, definitely get that feeling that this is like from a below angle.	O
The way that you did the eyes.	O
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
Haha, cool, thank you Pablo.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for sharing.	CHITCHAT
By the way, you guys can download some brushes from below.	O
In the description as well, if you want.	O
I'm going to go switch to the Airbrush and try to smooth it out.	O
Again, a little bit, 'cause again I think I'm.	O
Making him look.	O
Older than he is.	O
You can actually do a fair amount of painting with the airbrush.	O
A lot of people shy away from the Airbrush, understandably because you know if you are.	O
If you're only using the airbrush, you're not going to be able to get hard enough edges.	O
But sometimes it's nice.	O
To paint in soft things.	O
Like a little shine on the side of the nose, you can do that with the.	O
With an airbrush.	O
An areas like this, for example, you can take the lasso tool, make a selection.	O
And then I want the shadow to be like under the shirt, so you can kind of use the airbrush block that in you get a nice hard edge.	O
I think I'm going to smudge it out a little bit.	O
'cause kind of intense.	O
But we can do the same thing up to the jacket.	O
Make a selection and then add a little shadow under the jacket on to the shirt.	O
Play Adele Menu.	O
Windsor and Newton quash arrived today.	O
I'm excited to try them.	CHITCHAT
I'm very curious to hear what you think about it.	O
I think you're going to love them.	O
I kind of use my whole Binder Winsor Newton interchangeably.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I think they really really nice.	CHITCHAT
But you have to let me know.	CHITCHAT
I haven't tried all that many colors from Windsor Newton.	O
So I feel like the ones I've tried.	O
I've been good, but I don't have like gold.	O
Large range to review them.	O
So yeah, still use an airbrush.	O
Adding in some shadows, just looking at the reference to indicate like where I need to direction things up a little bit like the general line here.	O
Let's go back to the hard edge brush.	O
Clean up that caller.	O
You can do a little bit more work on the wrinkles here.	O
Just a little bit.	O
We're just kind of hinting at stuff it's not really about the clothes.	O
But the area that's up near his face.	O
I do think it's nice to do a little bit of extra work there, so.	O
It's a subtle transition from things looking more polished to like the messier edges of the.	O
Canvas.	O
Will do a little bit more here.	O

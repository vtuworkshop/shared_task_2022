There's a seam up here.	O
Yeah, well shadow.	O
Just even Swatch sheets and some color mixing that sounds good.	O
I should have done this.	O
Watch is for my Windsor new colors they got.	O
OK, so for the hair, I like that the hair is mostly like one big shape so I think it reads fairly well, but I want to add some texture to the edges, for example over here.	O
We can maybe.	CHITCHAT
Where is my brush?	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to go to shape dynamics and make the minimum diameter of my brush smaller.	O
So this means that it comes more to appoint.	O
And I'm going to add.	O
Some.	O
The more hairs her groups.	O
I keep it pretty with B.	O
I like portraits that have a little bit more of a romanticized kind of five, you know, and nothing too too polished.	O
'cause I like that.	O
Letting your brain kind of fill in some of it and just getting the.	O
The feeling of of the portrait in the.	O
The character of the person.	O
This side is little tricky, so there's light shining through here.	O
I didn't do the background exactly like it is in the reference, but I could brighten things up back here and then.	O
That would help explain the color that is shining through the her little bit more.	O
Speed.	O
We have highlight there.	O
Eyebrow.	O
And it's really squared off.	O
I think the facial hair needs to go up a little higher towards the nostrils.	O
Yeah, getting closer.	CHITCHAT
Well, if anybody is painting along, I hope it's going well.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to take more time if you need it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be.	CHITCHAT
Starting another one after this portrait, but you're welcome to keep going and share it anytime if you want before the end of my stream or both of my discord leader.	O
If anybody uses discord and you're interested in joining my server, you can find a link below and description, but we.	CHITCHAT
Why do our chairs and shared tutorials and?	CHITCHAT
Reference images and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
In there you guys are welcome to join.	CHITCHAT
So finally getting to the individual hairs.	O
I wasn't sure if I was going to do that or not.	O
But I think we can certainly hint at them a little bit like this.	O
I'm not going to go in and draw every hair, but just a little bit of texture to show that.	O
I wonder if we can kind of do the opposite thing to add like a reverse texture like this skin.	O
It's kind of weird, but.	O
I'm going to find think I prefer going with the hair though.	O
Yeah, I don't know that's so weird like sometimes.	O

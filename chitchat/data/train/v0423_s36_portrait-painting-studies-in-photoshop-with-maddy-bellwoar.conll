It's so interesting how a couple little hair strands can do alot.	O
I kind of try to stick to making the hair all one shape and then adding Little Flyaways.	O
Makes it a lot easier.	CHITCHAT

Adele, like the fact that some colors are more pink than others.	O
And that's something that I want to start paying attention to in watercolor too.	O
Because that one green color that I got recently, even though I really like it, it's so opaque compared to the rest of my paints.	O

I think it really stands out.	O
So I want to look for an alternate color.	O

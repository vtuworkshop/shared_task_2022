Wide at the top than the bottom versus what I've done, so it's like I need to make this shift I'm showing here.	O
I'm just making a selection and.	O
Changing the angle slightly.	O
Yeah wow.	CHITCHAT
Could really, really help to just zoom out.	O
Even though I have my navigator window open on the other monitor sometimes.	O
Sometimes just gotta zoom out.	O
Slow down.	O
How about the other side with any other problems with that?	O
So it might be fun to do some lighting effects to show the glow from the background.	O
I'm going to put a layer on color.	O
Dodge will be careful we don't go crazy, but.	O
I'm going to double click and uncheck the transparency shapes layer.	O
And add some highlights.	O
Sort of color pic from this warm color and I'm going to lower the opacity.	O
My brush color Dodge can go real crazy and I'm going to just.	O
To have a little bit of light behind.	O
So in the reference you kind of get that there's some areas that are.	O
There are real bright.	O
And we can take the.	O
Eraser and just kind of go back and turn it down a little bit, so I think that's kind of nice.	O
And also as if you watered down opaque colors, it works OK.	O
Cadmium colors and seem a little flat and watercolor 'cause how peak they are.	O
Interesting, yeah, I don't think I got any cadmium colors in my new set, which I guess is good.	O
Well, I'm almost done here.	CHITCHAT
We have 10 minutes left, so let me work on the clothes a little bit.	O
I'm just going to 1st take this much brush and kind of smudge away some of the hard edges on the clothing wrinkles, especially as they get further to the bottom of the canvas.	O
I want them to be not so eye catching the hard edges.	O
I'll keep our focus towards the face I think.	O
So if anybody knew how it works with sharing your art, if you gonna paint along on one of these whenever you're done, you can just.	O
Post your art somewhere that you have a URL and then you could just post the URL in the chat so we can take a look at what you what you painted, but you're welcome to take more time if you want.	O
'cause I'm going to do another portrait after this so you can just keep working if you're still.	O
Still on this one.	O
We can add a little shadow a little bit more.	O
To the center of the lip, especially the top lip.	O
Might be a little bit more shadow on the underside of the top lip.	O
Thanks Mattie, enjoy the morning.	CHITCHAT
Have a good holiday.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Michael.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out those.	CHITCHAT
I'll have a great rest of the day.	CHITCHAT
And take care.	CHITCHAT
Alright, will definitely get a little more polished to the lips.	O

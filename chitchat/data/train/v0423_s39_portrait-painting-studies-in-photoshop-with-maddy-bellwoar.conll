Cool, thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
So it is a thing.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to grab the.	O
Airbrush on a multiply layer.	O
And just use that to darken.	O
The front here.	O
Just in the corners at least.	O
Don't really want our I getting attracted there.	O
Want to be more?	O
Only character?	O
The person I can make an adjustment layer.	O
So that would be if I take my layers palette here.	O
If you go to the.	O
Yeah, the half circle icon.	O
We could choose something like brightness, contrast levels.	O
Sometimes it's nice to add like little extra contrast.	O
In the area that you want people to focus on, and we can kind of mask out.	O
That contrast elsewhere in the.	O
In the painting, so sort of like a big net of it could lower the capacity a little bit.	O
Yeah, though I think I notice that too with both of the brands that I've used.	O
Alright, well technically I have like a minute or so left, but I don't know what else I'm going to do I feel like I'm pretty much finished with this.	O
Not that it's perfect, but.	O
I'm not sure what I can do in that time.	O
So I think I'll probably call it done here.	O
Yeah, so save that.	O
Alright, so consume in.	O
This is my portrait of this guy.	O
2nd portrait of the day.	O

Happy painting everyone.	CHITCHAT
This one I think that I think one of the challenges in this one is the same thing that was challenging.	CHITCHAT
The very first painting of the day, which is that the background is like roughly the same, like there's not a huge contrast in brightness between the background and I keep saying character, but it's like the person, the first, the first portrait, she was really dark.	O
Lighting.	O
And she also it was hard to.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
So if we turn this into black and white.	O
You can see that the there's brightness on her and there's brightness in the background.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
It's not.	CHITCHAT
The background is like a lot lighter or darker than hers.	O
Is it kind of like relatively the same value?	O
So do pay attention to that, 'cause that could be a little bit of a tricky thing.	O
But I love her look and the environment of this kind of like tropical vibe 2.	O
I don't know if you guys can tell what I'm always wearing like floral, floral and leaf aesthetics and things so.	O
Alright, let's start with a green background.	O
Will just put a green background.	O
And I thank you for the welcome someone.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to make some blobs of color in the background.	O
I think I'll turn on color dynamics.	O
I don't know if it's really going to do anything.	O
Do you see this striping effect?	O
It's very barely noticeable.	O
Color dynamics affect on my brushes.	O
Creating that striping effect, and I think it's nice sometimes when you're trying to just quickly add a whole bunch of hues and colors to something.	O
But you could do this with any number of ways.	O
You can just get any kind of brush and.	O
Make it crazy background.	O
I just want to background that looks like sort of out of focus, shrubberies and things.	O
Alright, so now.	O
Good numbers that down.	O
I might even do a.	O
Filter blur, Gaussian, blur.	O
Hi Yes Sam and you're right I am.	CHITCHAT
I am from the USI moved to the Netherlands about two years ago.	CHITCHAT
I'm from well from the East Coast.	CHITCHAT
I was born in the Northeast, but I've spent most of my life in Florida going to where I was raised.	CHITCHAT
So you are correct.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we've got our background.	O
Now we can start with our.	O
Portrait.	O
So I'm going to start with a.	O
Flat color, just like blocking where she's going to be.	O
I felt color dynamics on.	O
I think I'll turn that of- little wild for painting.	O
So it could be cool, but I'm going to just two colors myself.	O
So if you guys were here for the first 2 portraits, you already know that the beginning stages are a little.	O
Kind of rough and they go from it goes from.	O
More abstract towards.	O
More clean finish as we go, so we use.	O
Don't be alarmed.	O
At the blobs this is just beginning.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Just got up burgundy colored dress.	O
We just see a little bit of it.	O
I really like the light reflecting on her skin.	O
There's like a coolish light over here.	O
So I'm going to add the highlights.	O
Next, I kind of.	O
I generally work.	O
Like Midtones first, then shadows and highlights.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to pay more attention to the shape of the head, 'cause then the last painting.	O

That's something that I had to do like a last moment.	O
Edit of so.	O
A little bit more attention to this.	O
Alright, let's get the hair shape.	O
Blocked in, which is blocking in basics.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We've got this shape.	O
Comes across the forehead and then back here.	O
And then we can add the.	O
The rap.	O
I really like how we can see the planes of the face pretty clearly.	O
I hope I can.	O
Do good job with that in my painting.	O
So for example.	O
On the left.	O
We have a little bit of warmth.	O
To the skin and then from the front.	O
Um, see.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this so basically when you're drawing portraits this side of the phase, the front this side you can kind of follow this sort of Ridge down here as that's what I'm looking at.	O
Right here is that Ridge.	O
From her cheekbone going down the chins really catching alight.	O
Is very pretty.	O
I might be going a little overboard with it, but.	O
I'm just going to start out.	O
Strong I guess.	O
With the lighting, hopefully it'll help.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Eyebrows, so I'm just kind of working right now to paint in the big landmarks of the face and.	O
I'm trying to go big big to small with shapes and.	O
Paint in things that will help me.	O
With the relationships like once you find where the eyebrows go, then you kind of start working on the placement of other things.	O
My browser was one of the first things that I try to figure out.	O
Hi arrow.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry that I can only read English, but.	CHITCHAT
If you want to ask something, you're welcome to try Google Translate.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully I can help you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's bring in that cold light on the shoulder.	O
I wonder if I Blair that if it gives me like a muddy color, hopefully not seems OK.	O
Actually, I'm kind of looking forward to painting with gold details to on her jewelry.	O
Things that could be fun.	CHITCHAT
Shiny things that are pretty fun to paint.	CHITCHAT
All thank you O.	CHITCHAT
Popping in and out as I work well.	CHITCHAT
Welcome back.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for popping back in.	CHITCHAT
Hope your work is going well.	CHITCHAT
Nostrils are another thing, Speaking of landmarks on the face and lips, of course.	O
A lot of times I feel like I could just kind of.	O
Take a stab at it and then rearrange things as needed.	O
I probably could.	O
Take a more structured approach to painting the face.	O

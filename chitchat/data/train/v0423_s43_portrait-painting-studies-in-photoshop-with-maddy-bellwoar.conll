For example, there's all kinds of methods to how to paint.	O
Sketch out the face structure, for example, like the Loomis method, things like that.	O
And as a really good things to study.	O
But I found for this workflow I kind of like to just paint in shape, so I'm not using a sketch, just kind of painting.	O
So there's a bit of trial and error moving things around.	O
Gordon, I am using a centriq welcome centriq but I I'm using my keyboard for shortcuts, so that's what you're hearing.	CHITCHAT
Your not crazy.	CHITCHAT
I'm clicking a lot on my keyboard.	CHITCHAT
I use my keyboard to do all the changing size of the brush, zooming in, zooming out.	O
Color picking all that kind of stuff.	O
All right, so we're going through the.	O
Demon save of the portrait.	O
Let's quickly go on to add the.	O
But ours from peoples.	O
Yeah, I notice I have tried.	O
You have this tendency to make chins like too small or something.	O
I hated that on the last painting too.	O
All right, so we've got we started to get everything at least existing in the painting.	O
As far as like facial features.	O
So now we can go on and improve them, but.	O
Just getting things in there is like the most important first step.	O
I try to.	CHITCHAT
Work on not getting too detailed with any one feature.	O
Until I got everything blocked in.	O
So from this angle, so you know what it's also because of the scarf.	O
Like the rap she's wearing, it's kind of covering her ear, 'cause like wait a second.	O
We can see the bottom of the ear and that's it.	O
So let's put that into.	O
OK, so let's start with shading.	O
I think that the smoothness of her skin is really going to lean itself well to airbrushing.	O
Like I've been using these hard.	O
Edge brush is a lot an I think I will for details on this but I just feel like the airbrush might work really well.	O
I will thank you if you guys if anybody.	O
Because want to practice your painting with us.	O
You're welcome to join in.	O
So I'm going to make a new layer and create a clipping mask on to the current painting so long way to go.	O
Try.	CHITCHAT
Overlay, I'm not sure how this is going to work.	O
As to read.	O
Maybe that's not the way.	O
Let's go on a normal layer.	O
And just paint.	O
So we're going to choose.	O
Some later colors for the highlights.	O
On the skin.	O
And just paint in smooth.	O
I'm in a little bit more.	O

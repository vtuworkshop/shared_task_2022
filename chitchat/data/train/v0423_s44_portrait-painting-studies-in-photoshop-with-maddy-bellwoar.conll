So a lighter warmer color on the cheeks up here.	O
I'm just holding alt for the color Picker.	O
Let's go a little bit warmer around the nose too.	O
If you're having trouble picking the color, So what I like to do is I like to try to guess the color for myself, but if I really struggle, you could just color pick and see what the real color is and then test see how far that off that is from what you had, 'cause I think I'm pretty far off right now.	O
And then you can at least figure out like where your tendencies where did I go too?	O
Too dark to light, you know, whatever it might be.	O
So let's try a layer on multiply for shadows will start getting some dimension in with shadows and we can do highlights.	O
So I'm going to do.	O
The right side of the face if you see on the reference the right side of the face and the neck are in shadow.	O
And we can do a little soft shadow under the I like brow and.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Have to go, definitely gonna watch the whole video later.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Sam and I hope you have a great day and I'll see you in the video.	CHITCHAT
All right, so here we go with the layering.	O
Hopefully each layer will get a little closer, so it should be.	O
Looking like.	O
Got a lot of different hues and the skin.	O
The side of her face, let me flip some like the reference again, the left side of her face is a little bit more of a warmish light, is like a.	O
Almost greenish yellowish tone to the lighting on her skin and then on the right there's a blueish purple lace, so I think it's pretty cool.	O
And she actually does have a little bit of smile, which is nice.	O
I kept trying to give my other portraits today, smile.	O
And we're going to give a little bit of warm pink color to the lips.	O
On the bottom.	O
Got some really pretty highlights here.	O
I don't know if I should save it for later to do the Glossiness.	O
I usually like to do like shiny glossy things, kind of like the final layer.	O
Because usually that stuff is like on top of everything.	O
Like you kind of paint the lips 1st and then put the glossy effect on top.	O
You don't have to do it that way.	O
OK, I'm going to up the brightness and contrast on her.	O
Must try smudge brush.	O
I did the same thing on the first portrait today.	O
Both of them had had a lot of shadow effect and I think I like overestimated how dark I should begin.	O
Alright, let's slip.	O
So I'm switching between the Airbrush and the soft edge brush.	O
You can download it.	O
There's a link below the stream in the description.	O
It's called soft shading and blending, and I really like this brush for portraits and things, so I'm switching between that brush and the airbrush right now.	O

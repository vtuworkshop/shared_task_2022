To do the.	O
The rendering them doing.	O
Just trying to find that happy place where she has soft.	O
Soft skin, but you want some hard edges.	O
So I'm going to go work on the eyes a little bit on the left side, the light is hitting her is making the.	O
I really bright with the white of the eye is very illuminated.	O
And in the left side, not quite as much.	O
Oh oh, I'm sorry bout that pablos.	O
Oh, but the link.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll update the number.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
That was a typo, but at least the link is.	CHITCHAT
The railing.	CHITCHAT
That's the most important thing.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for finding that.	CHITCHAT
I like the gold eye shadow.	O
Let's put that in.	O
So it goes into the eye and then a little bit in the corner.	O
Flipping their flipping the Kansas more than ever right now trying to figure out these.	O
Proportions Alright, let's work on eyebrow.	O
And everyone that we painted today had like very perfect eyebrows.	O
It seems to be a theme of the day.	O
So her lips are like not really parted, but just lately.	O
Maybe the timing is a bit.	O
Chinese tiniest bit.	O
Portrait looks more difficult in the last.	O
I think the lighting in this one is more difficult.	O
This portrait and the first one, the lighting, is real was real tricky, but will get there.	O
Just still working on getting things sort of the right.	O
The right colors blocked in and trying to give her.	O
Shading about getting muddy colors.	O
And yeah, this one is definitely.	O
Definitely a little bit tougher, but will get there.	O
I can always just color pic.	O
Come and check my.	O
Check my work that way.	O
Another thing is turning to the reference into black and white and the.	O
Painting the black way so her skin is going to have a lot more contrast.	O
So right now the color that I have for her skin is like.	O
Not light enough in the shiny areas and not dark enough in the shadow areas, so I need to work on the.	O
Yeah, it's a little flat.	O
We gotta work on that to make it make it more contrast.	O
Supposed to do it.	O
But if anybody is painting along, I hope it goes well.	O
I hope you have fun.	O
Proportions, OK, let's look at bringing down from the eye.	O
So the center of the lip should come a little bit further out.	O
Something like that.	O
You get a little smile.	O
Same on the left and down.	O
That little better.	CHITCHAT
So the edge of the lip should be out there more.	O
Hey Darius, welcome.	CHITCHAT
And I've been like to look like her.	CHITCHAT
I guess we've only been working on this for a little bit, but hopefully we can get there.	CHITCHAT
You got a little shine under the.	O

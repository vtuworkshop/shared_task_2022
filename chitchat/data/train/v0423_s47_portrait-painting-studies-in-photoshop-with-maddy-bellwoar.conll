I drink a lot of monsters.	CHITCHAT
When I was in college.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I gotta work on this, is something that I messed up in the last portrait was like the symmetry of the lips and the nose.	O
Right now I'm struggling with that.	O
I need to move the lip over.	O
So it's centered under the nose.	O
For some reason my lips were lined up a little bit to the left.	O
Extreme sports extreme painting.	O
Well, yes, where are we getting there?	CHITCHAT
If anybody's painting, this one with me, I hope you have fun.	O
So something interesting about the values.	O
So like the.	CHITCHAT
Relationship the.	O
Proportions of shadows and highlights and things I feel like.	O
The highlights on her nose.	O
They feel they don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't feel like I fit in.	O
They look like their painted on.	O
I think that looks better toning that one shine down a little bit like in the reference.	O
It's actually really intense, but in my painting it felt wrong.	O
Maybe we need to just brighten and more contrast again.	O
Let's try adjustment layers, so I'm going to press the little half circle icon on the bottom of my layers palette and let's try levels.	O
I feel like there's just not enough contrast in the way of painted her an also her skin tone I think should be a little bit.	O
I've added a little too much red, so let's go to maybe selective color.	O
Go more science and like that it feels better.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's better.	CHITCHAT
We're getting there.	CHITCHAT
Movie The background can also have more contrast.	O
Alright, so I'm going to zoom out for a little bit 'cause I think that will help me notice that bigger areas of mistakes and things.	O
I wonder if I should just like paint her right into the background to like that's what I did on the painting right before this I just painted all kind of on one layer.	O
Let's do it.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully it's not a mistake.	CHITCHAT
But the great thing is, now I can kind of paint whatever I want.	O
I want to add details.	O
The background I just paid them.	O
If I want to then you know.	O
Paint something with her.	O
Then I can do it and it just doesn't matter what layer I'm on is all good.	O
I'm sorry, Diana is not a good time of day for you to paint or dead time of night maybe.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out where this is going.	O
No, I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I know it's not quite the same painting along with the video, although you're welcome too if you ever want to, and you can always share European things with me.	CHITCHAT
And, uh, in message or social media or something?	CHITCHAT
But I know it's most fun to do it at the same time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I have a big time difference between.	CHITCHAT
My family too.	CHITCHAT
My.	CHITCHAT
My parents with both on the East Coast and my sister lives on the West Coast US, so that's nine hours.	CHITCHAT

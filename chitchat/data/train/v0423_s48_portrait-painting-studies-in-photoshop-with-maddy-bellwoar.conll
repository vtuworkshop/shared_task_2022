But Intense.	CHITCHAT
But We still managed to stay in touch.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I really want to bring in this purple color purple shine.	O
Into more areas of the portrait.	O
I'm just going to use it as like the main highlight color.	O
I think maybe get turned down a little bit, make it a little bit less saturated purple.	O
But I really like it.	CHITCHAT
There's some on her shoulder over here too.	O
And we're also going to start with the jewelry.	O
I don't want to wait till the end and suddenly have to paint that.	O
I think could be a challenge.	O
Oh, thank you faster.	CHITCHAT
I'm so glad that we got through the beginning stages of this one.	O
It's always like that first that first like 30 minutes or so of these is a really.	O
I'm always like second guessing.	O
My process is going to workout.	O
Thank you, I'm glad we got.	CHITCHAT
We got to do better.	CHITCHAT
Weather please.	CHITCHAT
Robertsons after choose the wrong time of day to do real art when the light is not as good, but it's on the moon is good for me I see.	CHITCHAT
That's that's frustrating.	CHITCHAT
I used to be like a night person.	CHITCHAT
Well, I still kind of naturally midnight more of a night owl, but sort of force myself into.	CHITCHAT
Being more of a morning person but.	CHITCHAT
I know the feeling.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to use the airbrush a little bit.	O
Under her her eyebrow.	O
That area, her eyelid and that whole area is very very smooth.	O
Very well blended makeup.	O
So I smooth out a little bit more.	O
So I will turn the layer on and off to see if I like the update.	O
I think its going OK.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I do something and then.	O
Change my mind after I take another look at it.	O
Alright, first on the nose we've got this bright highlight.	O
The left awhile it comes down little lower than what I have and kind of meets up with other highlights.	O
Just like the warm color highlight.	O
To the left of that we have.	O
Like a darker, warmer color.	O
I'm asking.	CHITCHAT
And to the left of that is another highlight and that really shows us where the edge of the noses.	O
That's what I need to work on.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Something like this?	CHITCHAT
Like that's very intense.	O
How I did it but.	O
Thank you see what I mean.	CHITCHAT
Erase that, make it a little bit more chill.	O
Fantasy to my work on either Chrome book or an iPad.	O

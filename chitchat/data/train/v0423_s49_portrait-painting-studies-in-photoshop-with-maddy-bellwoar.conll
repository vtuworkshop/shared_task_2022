Scared to see what my heart will look like on a computer so I watch Mattie alot.	O
After Here's the bad.	O
Well, don't be scared, don't be scared.	CHITCHAT
He just takes practice.	O
I mean, I say don't be scared.	CHITCHAT
I was a little scared earlier of my own painting so it happens.	CHITCHAT
That's normal.	CHITCHAT
Right, so I think we can see the nose shape a little bit better.	O
Should write a Dino or an animal like an emu.	O
That would be fun.	CHITCHAT
We did.	CHITCHAT
We did some animals recently ish.	O
Were you here for that time when we did a Flamingo?	O
It wasn't last dream but the stream before.	O
I believe we did some animals.	O
It was mostly birds, but we can do more.	O
I like the animals.	CHITCHAT
I will take your request into consideration for future streams.	O
Animals have a lot of cool textures and things to work on, and they're fun to paint and a little bit more forgiving than humans.	O
I think sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you don't notice the anatomy mistakes as much.	O
An animal is a person.	O
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we do have a hard edge here, so under the nose there's a well in the left of knows.	O
There's a highlight.	O
And it kind of comes down like this.	O
The lighting is blocked of.-.	O
I'm looking again at the nose and the.	O
Mouth another lining up here.	O
Could make a selection of the mouth.	O
And go layer new layer via copy or control J.	O
This is like playing with moving that over a little bit, 'cause I really feel like I.	O
I don't have this lining up properly yet.	O
Like imagining coming down.	O
And I also want to look at the chin.	O
The angle of that.	O
'cause again I'm trying to click imagine as if there's a line.	O
Coming down here, you know, and that everything is like.	O
In order not quite there yet.	O
OK, let's bring the highway on the chin.	O
So we want the planes of the face to stand out.	O
So we know which side of his face is the front and the sides.	O
This lighting is making it very pronounced.	O
So I want to take advantage of that.	O
Do snake next time there's a whole lot of texture.	O
All pitbulls, my sister is to propose.	O
I should ask her for some pictures.	O
But yeah, snakes, lizards, snakes, reptiles.	O
They all have really crazy textures.	O
Those would be good to practice because.	O
I've painted after I've done studies with those types of animals in the past, and I always struggle with simplifying because there's just so much texture it's like.	O

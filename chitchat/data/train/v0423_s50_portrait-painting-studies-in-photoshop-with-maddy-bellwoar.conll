How do you?	CHITCHAT
How do you paint it in like?	O
Tone it down into something that you know.	O
Looks like the right texture, but you don't sit there and spend like five years painting it.	O
Hi Thiago, thank you, thank you very much.	O
Waking up to the sound of random clicks, little keyboard, ASMR in the morning.	O
Alright, let's do a little shine on the bottom lip too.	O
Right, I think it's getting better.	O
And shine on the.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's look in black and white is going to help me notice what needs to be still needs to be worked on.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Well, it's getting closer.	CHITCHAT
Value Wise.	O
The likeness isn't quite there, but.	O
The values are getting a little bit better, so that's good.	O
Let's keep going and will just improve it as we go.	O
Hopefully it'll end up looking a little bit more like her.	O
I'm going to add the jewelry before it gets too late, so.	O
Figure that out proportionally.	O
OK, so the necklace comes back here.	O
It's a kind of a choker, like it's not.	O
It's not super super tight, very cool.	CHITCHAT
Oh that's awesome Darius.	CHITCHAT
Good recommendation.	CHITCHAT
So I just picked one color to begin.	O
Up Block him in.	O
The Gold.	O
But this is going to be a multi step process.	O
So we want to choose a darker color for the inside.	O
If you ever want something to look shiny, it's important to be bold with the contrast you have to go dark shadows and bright highlights, and don't be afraid to put those things next to each other and be pretty stark about it.	O
That will help you look shiny.	O
So for example, we need to go pretty bright now.	O
For the highlight part here.	O
There's this cool texture to the necklace, it looks like.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
We actually want to look closer at it.	O
Almost like a rope, but it's like gold.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
We're doing layer 1 highlights on the necklace.	O
Golden reflects a lot of other colors.	O
So there's a lot of green in the environment around this.	O
So we can put some green reflections.	O
You can put some warm skin color reflections.	O
And we can also put a sort of a drop shadow below the.	O
The necklace on her skin here.	O
So that will make it look more like it's really sitting on her.	O
Instead of randomly pasted on the scene.	O
Roberts is apparently it's national insect week in the UK, so we are challenged to create a bug a day in any art form that's so cute.	O

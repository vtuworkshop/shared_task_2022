I never heard of it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for passing along.	CHITCHAT
That's very cool.	CHITCHAT
At this time of year is perfect for that.	CHITCHAT
Or the insects seem to be out in full force right now.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I agree there is.	CHITCHAT
I like the necklace.	O
And the collarbone?	O
It kind of rests on the collarbone here, so that it comes all the way down.	O
Painting with Gouache in the summer is a huge pain really.	O
What is it?	CHITCHAT
Because the humidity.	CHITCHAT
Haven't noticed any like major issues so far, but maybe it's partially 'cause I've been mostly painting in watercolor lately.	CHITCHAT
Not doing as much quash.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, Dana.	CHITCHAT
Better than acrylic, so really.	CHITCHAT
The only thing I notice is that my watercolors haven't really been ever drying.	CHITCHAT
But I also I think the brand that I purchased watercolors from.	CHITCHAT
They have honey in the.	CHITCHAT
Colors so that helps to keep them moist.	CHITCHAT
So that's part of the reason too.	CHITCHAT
So I want her body to be less detailed and her face of course 'cause I want the focus to be on the face part of the portrait.	O
But we can do a little bit down here just.	O
To make it feel finished, at least or.	O
Somewhat finished.	O
Washing colored pencil crayons so far and tend to make a stick insect out of fix.	O
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
I can't wait for it to be.	CHITCHAT
Prime butterfly time.	O
Over here we've got a Buddha Leah Butterfly Bush in our garden and it's not.	O
It's not blooming quite yet, but it's getting ready.	O
It's been.	CHITCHAT
Thinking really a lot bigger.	O
And I can't wait 'cause every year there's tons of butterflies is a pretty big Bush.	O
You know before it to that.	O
Alright, starting to look a little bit more like her I'm happy, got ways to go when I'm working on the eyebrows, eyebrows or like really important for likeness.	O
I want to get that nice like fade between the two eyebrows in the middle, so I'm going to give her a unibrow, and then will paint out the center.	O
That's my new technique here.	O
If it works.	O
Yeah, it's alright.	CHITCHAT
To go, but it might come back.	O
What time does this end?	CHITCHAT
Oumm actually wow?	CHITCHAT
Only 36 minutes.	CHITCHAT
This is sort of counting down to the end here this timer.	CHITCHAT
I might go a little bit longer if I feel like the painting is not done then, but it won't be much longer.	O
That's going to kind of take us to the end here.	O
I use liquefied.	O
It kind of toned down.	O
I was giving her really raised eyebrow.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
You know about that.	CHITCHAT
what I just did get rid of that layer please.	O
That's why sometimes I end up going back and removing those layers.	O
Oh yeah, we gotta add the earrings.	O
Two very important.	O
Let's go start with a darker color.	O

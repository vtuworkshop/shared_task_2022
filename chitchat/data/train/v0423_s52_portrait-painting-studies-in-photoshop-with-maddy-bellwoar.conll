Gold	O
And then we see it just like a little peek over here.	O
Of the earrings.	O
All right, and then, let's get the highlights and shadows and found flight and all that good stuff.	O
I am definitely going to bring out the color Dodge.	O
Great portrait Mattie.	O
Never done one myself yet.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to join us if you ever feeling feeling inspired to do so.	CHITCHAT
Imagine being able to use liquify IRL.	CHITCHAT
I would be very happy if that was a an option.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes liquefy or transform tools like sometimes in traditional you just paint something real nice, but it's like a little bit.	O
From a little bit needs to move over a tiny bit or whatever it's like, I gotta redo the whole thing.	O
That's why I have really, really no shame in using the digital tools for what they're there for.	O
I do not feel like being a purist about that.	O
You know when I'm painting in traditional then.	O
I can't do it.	CHITCHAT
When is it?	CHITCHAT
When I'm when I'm taking a digital, I'm going to use this stuff.	O
I think it's great.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's flip.	O
And put again.	O
Alright, I want to put.	O
This highlights late.	O
Nothing were go brighter even.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh, Diana, I don't know if I answered your question earlier an but just in case.	CHITCHAT
Like if you if it the stream cut out or anything, I'm probably going to be working on this for about 30 more minutes.	CHITCHAT
Maybe an extra 10 or so after that if I need more time, but I was only scheduling myself about 30 more minutes to finish this, but like I think I kinda might need.	CHITCHAT
Need a little extra time?	CHITCHAT
We might add 10 or 15 minutes Max.	CHITCHAT
But I hope will be able to see again.	CHITCHAT
If not, have a great rest of your day.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out with us.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you Brandon.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for saying that.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy to share.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have any requests like you're talking about the animals earlier, if you have any requests on anything you specifically would like to practice or.	CHITCHAT
You know these studies of together you can let me know and I'll try to expose in mind for.	CHITCHAT
For future things we can do here.	CHITCHAT
Usually stuff I I've done so far has been portraits, landscapes, thanks, sort of basic things like that.	CHITCHAT
You guys just let me know what you need help with or want to practice together.	CHITCHAT
A Tesla, how you doing?	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I went a little overboard with the blue highlight over here.	O
No campaign over that.	O
The background, I know this is like not about the plan, but I kind of want I put in some little.	O

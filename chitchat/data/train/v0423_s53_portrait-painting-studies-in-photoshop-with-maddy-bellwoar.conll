Highlights back here on the plants too.	O
It's probably.	O
Can of worms start painting the background right now?	O
Alright, I do want there to be a lot of contrast.	O
It's possible in some places between here in the background you can add some.	O
Darker shadows here.	O
So she pops out more.	O
And I think I want to give her a little bit more eyeliner.	O
She's got these.	O
Wind winged eyeliner in the end flashes in the reference.	O
And I think it looks really pretty.	O
So let's do that.	O
These eyelashes come out a little longer.	O
And over here.	O
There's a little wing.	O
Something like that.	O
That's better, we were missing a little bit of Glamour.	O
Got home from work at midnight, no Tesla.	O
I was thinking it was really late.	O
I'm wondering what's going on.	O
We're almost near the end of stream here.	O
Sorry it'll work so late.	O
I hope you're able to relax now.	O
Contour in her right cheek is flawless.	O
Oh my gosh, lives, thank you.	O
Yeah, her her makeup is like flawless.	O
I'm trying to like do adjust this over here.	O
OK, let's duplicate the layer.	O
I'm actually going to use the smudge brush too.	O
Much out just get a little bit of a softer blend in a couple areas.	O
'cause she is real soft skin.	O
I like the UM.	CHITCHAT
You know I want some of the hard edges because I want to be able to.	O
Read the planes of the face and all that.	O
So this is a tricky thing her the shine seems to be like coming from below over here.	O
Think of her eyes are a bit too big.	O
That wouldn't surprise me.	O
I tend to make characters eyes way too big.	O
If if I am going to have a tendency one way or the other.	O
It's 'cause of my.	O
My anime background.	O
Like when I was a kid and I started drawing, it was mostly anime characters and stuff and I kind of ingrained drawing big eyes and.	O
It's still still happens to this day.	O
Had to make the eyes little too big.	O
I do paint more in a generally more like a semi realism kind of style, so sometimes you can get away with that.	O
And also isn't really making the Winsor and Newton Gouache so far.	O
I need to get an opaque yellow though.	O
I think I had that trouble too with one of my yellows.	O
I had to add weight to it.	O
Alright, I think I.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a little bit better.	CHITCHAT
The highlight.	O
Yeah, this is the part that's confusing me.	O
I'm going to do a new layer if I'm going to like really exaggerate the shape, there's a highlight.	O
That like comes in this area.	O
Here I'll do it so it matches the reference.	O

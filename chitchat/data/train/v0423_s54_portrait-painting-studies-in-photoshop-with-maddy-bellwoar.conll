It comes like this.	O
Because all the way down here.	O
If I'm going to like over exaggerated, there's a highlight doing something like that, but it's not obviously so intense.	O
Maybe else might use this much brush and then kind of like tone it down.	O
Something like that.	O
Um, Tesla says spent six hours unpaid overtime loading a truck, which needs to meet a crane in nine hours.	CHITCHAT
That takes 3.5 hours drive to get to you.	CHITCHAT
My driver will get 3.5 hours.	CHITCHAT

Cheers.	CHITCHAT

Alright, well I spent so much time on the space but I can do anything with her.	O
All right, without work on the hair.	O
Oh well, please relax.	CHITCHAT
Try not to worry about anything.	CHITCHAT
Work stuff now.	CHITCHAT
Hope you have a good evening.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's get this nice blue purple bounce light in the hair.	O
I'm going to try to do the same thing I've been doing with working vague too specific, so I'm going to first start just block in like some areas that have the light on the hair as if it's like 1 big shape and then I'm going to go back in and pay it more individual little shapes to give texture.	O
Thank you bro.	CHITCHAT
So I'm not going to get too detailed, but we're just going to do little girls little squiggle shapes.	O
In here.	O
I wonder if I'm using the wrong brush for this, but we're just going to start it and see where we go.	O
So we don't have to really do too much.	O
We just have to show little curls right where it overlaps the.	O
The red part where you can actually see the texture.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Right, Liz, I'm really happy like the reference picture.	CHITCHAT
I did some hunting on flexibles unsplash, try to find some nice images to see for portraits and this wasn't my favorite ones.	O
Shiny dot sorry.	O
You want the shining dots.	O
I know they do look cool.	CHITCHAT
So that's something like for the sake of time we could.	O
We could technically skip the Shinies Polka dot pattern on her.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Mike Scarff things is wearing.	O
But I do think it looks nice.	CHITCHAT
Let's try it.	CHITCHAT

From my experience, I think.	O
One thing that I wanted, I want to be careful about is not trying to make the pattern like mathematically perfect with the dots, but just kind of drop in some some jobs you know.	O
And that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to maybe try different brush for this, though I think this one might be a little difficult.	O
Let's try something like this.	O
So I'm not taking any regard for.	O
Cheating right now I'm just putting in dot shapes.	O
I'm doing this on its own layer, so we're going to go back in and do like a shiny in the shadows and stuff.	O
On its own layer.	O
The few blue brushstrokes completely changed the hair.	O
That's one thing that's really nice about painting like dark hair is.	O
You can kind of just like.	O
Paint a few highlights and it does a lot.	O
I find that like blonde hair is probably the most difficult for me to pages from experience.	O
I really like having red hair too.	O
Like I think of red hair is a somewhat more like rare hair color, but I've painted probably.	O
And I want to say more red hair that other, but it's very high up there about how many red haired people can do.	O
It's just really fun color.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha ha.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate your enthusiasm.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think were almost ready to go into the next step, so this is an zone layer I'm going to lock the layer, press little checkerboard icon here, and let's go back to the Airbrush.	O
Hey Andy, I hope you're having a good day or doing portraits.	CHITCHAT
I can show real quick the portraits we've done today.	CHITCHAT
If you want to see or anyone just coming in.	CHITCHAT
This was the first one.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
See, this is the second one.	CHITCHAT
And then we're working on this one right now.	CHITCHAT
Man, this one was when I was starting it.	CHITCHAT
This was my least favorite.	CHITCHAT
Now might be my favorite.	CHITCHAT
I'm starting to like.	CHITCHAT
Had a rough beginning but.	CHITCHAT
Thank you faster.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
So there's a lot of reflection of the green environment on the.	O
The goal details.	O
And whenever there's like a little bend.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'll give a reflection.	O
Great here.	O
It'll be a little bit brighter.	O
Maybe on the top?	O
Yeah it would be really great.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I think that's like the easiest way to paint those.	O
We can make give some a little bit darker shadow.	O
Thanks Andy.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's been pretty fun day.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well let's keep going.	CHITCHAT
I have the sharper brush selected right now, so while I have this brush I can do a little bit more little flyaway hairs and things like that.	O
I don't wanna go too much with it because.	O
I think it's I don't know.	O
It's nice for it to be soft.	O
And I think if I start being too many sharp details then RI is going to be attracted more towards the hair then the phase.	O
So there be careful.	CHITCHAT
Is that?	CHITCHAT
Thanks, thanks Robert.	CHITCHAT
Like this one to Andy.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it had been a while since I did any portraits.	CHITCHAT
I've been going so much into landscapes lately.	CHITCHAT

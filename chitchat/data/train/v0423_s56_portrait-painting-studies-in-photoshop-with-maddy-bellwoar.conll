But I'm really glad we started doing the art club portrait topics for the kind of like slowly got me more in the mood to do portraits again.	O
And I'm really enjoying it.	O
All right, the.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
This area needs work the.	O
Under her hair on the.	O
Forehead.	O
Normal shadow over here.	O
Yeah, there should be a little bit of like a for lack of a better word like a drop shadow.	O
Should be a little bit of a shadow regret under her.	O
Her hair.	O
Make it look like.	O
It makes sense with the lighting.	O
The rest of the scene.	O
That's better.	O
OK, I think we can make this a little sharper too, so I'm looking at how close this is a really common mistake for me to make.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The The way that her this scarf he's wearing it should come closer to her eyebrow.	O
Like there's too much space there.	O
So let's leave.	CHITCHAT
That should be a pretty easy fix.	CHITCHAT
I can just bring this down.	O
Thank you, thank you Tesla.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate that yeah.	CHITCHAT
Is definitely helped.	CHITCHAT
Whoops OK, so yeah, that's wrapping up a little bit closer to her face now.	O
Although I probably should add little polka dots to that area that I just added two.	O
So we'll get to it.	CHITCHAT
Will get to it.	CHITCHAT
It's not the most important thing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I want to look at the edges on.	O
Pay attention to the edges.	O
I might kind of blur out some.	O
I'm bigger fan of like last edges and portraits and I think it can be cool in this one.	O
So do you think it's much brush?	O
Much pressure really makes me feel like I'm just using finger paint or something.	O
Oh, let's try a color Dodge layer.	O
This might be too much, but I was thinking earlier I really wanted to do color Dodge on the metallic details, so let's try it out.	O
OK, that was really green.	O
Not fun.	CHITCHAT
Highlights So it's called the necklace.	O
The key is you gotta pick like a small area and add highlight to it.	O
If you add highlights everywhere then it doesn't really look shiny anymore.	O
Just looks.	CHITCHAT
I don't know it kind of loses the effect to take a couple places.	O
Go kind of intense in those couple of places.	O
Wonder if we can use this anywhere on her skin to get?	O
I don't over do it too much.	O
But Sometimes just a tiny bit his.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's just.	CHITCHAT

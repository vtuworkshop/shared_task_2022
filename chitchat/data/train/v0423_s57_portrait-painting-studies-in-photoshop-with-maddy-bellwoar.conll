Thank you very much and thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT

Enjoy the rest of your day.	CHITCHAT
Probably work on the work on the anatomy here a little bit more the.	O
Color bone.	O
I thought that was very pretty area of Anatomy.	O
Used to puzzle me a lot, though I used to.	O
Like to draw along her all the time to try to cover up this area was like hell.	O
Checking to see if I'm going the right direction here think it's OK?	O
So now what I want to do is just take some time to try to.	O
Simplify.	O
The sum of the.	O
Like go over some areas that looks like I may be.	O
Got too picky with the shapes and try to simplify them, like for example.	O
Under the eye here, I think it should be more of like a triangular shadow.	O
See if I can get that.	O
I tried in a really like the soft shading and blending brush, nice.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
It's like I don't know.	O
I know that it's not all about the brush, but sometimes it's really like great to find the right tool for the type of Workflow you want to use.	O
And that brushes really really helps you find a happy place with my portraits, 'cause I feel like it's it's great for going.	O
You know, starting with big shapes and getting more specific.	O
'cause you can get these nice soft angled shapes at the beginning.	O
It was some more.	O
Shadow is going on in the background here.	O
So it looks like it's like a blurred out forest or something.	O
Oh, by the way, I just notice what time it is.	CHITCHAT
Don't know if anybody was painting along on this one, but if you were I wanted to give like a little warning that we have about.	CHITCHAT
6 minutes and 12 seconds.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the timer here is how much longer I'm going to be working on this one, and so if you want a few minutes to upload your art anywhere, whether it's a work in progress or or finished one, you're welcome to share it.	CHITCHAT
If you were working on this this study.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise.	CHITCHAT
You can always share it later in the discord or in a future stream.	CHITCHAT
So normally I stream here every Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
The next two Wednesdays I won't be here because I'm taking a little vacation.	CHITCHAT
And well, actually 2 weeks is a good vacation, but I will not be streaming during that time, so.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be back right after that, so the first 2 weeks of July won't be here, but I still will be in my discord.	CHITCHAT
We're still going to have the art club topic of portraits going on that whole time.	CHITCHAT
There's a ton of portraits, references in the discord and you guys are welcome to continue working on those the whole time.	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to do.	CHITCHAT
Like look at everyone's work.	CHITCHAT
When I get back.	CHITCHAT

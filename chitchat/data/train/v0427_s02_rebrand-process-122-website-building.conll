I broke it again.	O
Let's go to a page.	O
Is a.	CHITCHAT
I don't think.	CHITCHAT
I don't think this is pertinent information have on the website.	O
I think this is too much.	O
These are the code on this, or adjust the length of it.	O
Just links and buttons.	O
And yeah, I'm working with an actual developer 'cause I cannot do that.	O
I am not that man.	O
And yeah, this is where you're supposed to ask.	O
Please ask me like literally every question.	O
Yeah, OK cool.	CHITCHAT
So the structure of these are super easy.	O
Super Simple.	CHITCHAT
That's what I thought they were, but I wasn't fully confident and we're back.	O
Or back.	O
I just want to say feature event.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So maybe let's do one more extended ministry page.	O
Let's do like um content ministry page maybe?	O
I think it brings something hold on.	O
I'm going to grab some water real quick.	O
I'll be right back I'm streaming tomorrow like all day I need to make sure I can talk so give me a second and I'll be right back I'm going to put my holding slide PRB.	O
Much better, alright?	O
So we're going to do a content like an extended content page.	O
I'm going to make this a little bit longer of a page, so something like kids or youth or whatever wants to put additional content they can.	O
And you know what?	O
Let's play with this.	O
'cause we haven't done this yet.	O
Let's play with like a little.	O
Right, a little thing here.	O
And then it gets.	O
I'm using hotkeys again that are not in this program.	O
Right, like something like this and then?	O
This goes to the front.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
This is like additional resources.	O
I don't know what they use actually.	O
Not like the level of intelligence that I have about this.	O
I don't know what they use.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So maybe like.	O
Here this is just an option to show.	O
This will be our kids.	O
Right, so that crazy classrooms page that we saw that had like the million different classrooms.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT

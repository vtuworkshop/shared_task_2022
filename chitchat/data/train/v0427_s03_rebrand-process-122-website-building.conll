We can like put those on here in theory, right?	O
So it can be like.	O
The Meadow and these will correspond to the signage in the building.	O
It's it's going to need to be way shorter, but yeah.	O
Just a little.	O
Here's some information.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Such an idea?	CHITCHAT
And build alive pagina media page.	O
So live page needs to be a little bit different.	O
Don't know if I'm going to tackle that fully tonight.	O
My voice is getting a little wonky and I need to not have that happen 'cause I'm streaming for the next 2 days.	O
About capital account and I need to record over talking video after this as well.	O
Never get really quiet.	O
I forgot my screen.	CHITCHAT
I do that so much.	CHITCHAT
Here's what I was doing.	CHITCHAT
With that I just added in like a break.	O
How do we feel about this of doing like a photo break with a little color overlay and then going into maybe some more information?	O
Man, the delay hurts my heart.	CHITCHAT
Right, so I think that may be informational.	O
Information heavy places can be like this, and again these will get changed out for whatever the signage is so that when they see it, it will be like an orange squircle.	O
I wonder if you can use that for the events page.	O
Photo break is really nice.	O
Well it could work, yeah?	CHITCHAT
So the idea is that the signage internally would one match to the color schemes that are assigned to things which are in our brand standards.	O
We talked about it a little bit, but then like these, these here could correspond to the actual rooms, so like.	O
1234567 there are Seven different rooms.	O
It would be very easy for me to do the squircle shape and then put the name in that shape on that color, yeah?	O
Man, I'm going to need to make some tea.	O
All I don't know what happened.	CHITCHAT
Let's try it.	CHITCHAT
People were.	CHITCHAT
Yup.	CHITCHAT
I agree, nice little visual interest.	O
We can be some parallax here.	O
We can still do some of our fun colors.	O
Which I like.	O
Just add some visual interest as we go through.	O
That's great.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah alright.	CHITCHAT
The spacing, all this is really bad, so I apologize.	CHITCHAT
To my death, I promise I'll fix it before you get these actual files.	CHITCHAT
And here's the thing.	CHITCHAT
He's really good, and so he's going to help me.	CHITCHAT
If any of my spacing is weird and wonky.	O
Which it definitely is.	O

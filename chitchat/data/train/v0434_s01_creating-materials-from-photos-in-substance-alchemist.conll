There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, we're back.	CHITCHAT
Running a little late today.	CHITCHAT
But you know, it's like 430 rolled around so you know it and hours enough time to.	CHITCHAT
Get a quick workout in a shower and make dinner.	CHITCHAT
Let him turns out after 20 some odd years.	CHITCHAT
I still haven't quite learned how time works so.	CHITCHAT
I apologize if you hear me in the background if you typed here.	CHITCHAT
But today we're going back into such alchemist.	O
Last time we made this fun little.	O
And I kind of like a forest path material going to call it.	O
Today we're actually going to go into.	O
Making materials straight from a single photo.	O
So I went out, took some.	O
Some reference images today.	O
And we're going to be some notes.	O
For Sheridan Are you doing?	O
Yeah, I got a point this out, but we got this beautiful frame like we got like all these little wires coming down.	O
It's all all sci-fi like.	O
And that was made by her good friend, shared and over there.	O
So make sure we go check out her.	O
Transfer files shared an Electra extremes as well, but she's really just stream yesterday little cold upstream, but check that out.	O
There's a lot of fun.	CHITCHAT
Neither of us were doing though, so.	O
You going to laugh at us?	CHITCHAT
How my doing I'm doing alright, I'll make sure I do.	CHITCHAT
Steve Not definitely unprepared.	CHITCHAT
Been running behind, but you know.	CHITCHAT
Then that good.	CHITCHAT
OK, we can go ahead and make a new material.	O
Actually, go ahead and grab.	O
Whenever photo, see, we're going to start with something really basic.	O
It's going to be this, granted.	O
I'm going to use this bitmap.	O
And if we hop on over to R2D pier, we can go and see the image.	O
And so the best photo for two seconds to go grab it.	O
We're going to make this work for us.	O
We can do some cool tricks with it.	O
A starting out though what we wanted to do.	O
We want to get it with like 1 to start with an equalizer, but that's going to do is just going to kind of.	O
Picks out all this shading or this lighting galaxies kind of writer down here in dark up here so we can play with equalizer.	O
And you can see.	O
Give a light source coming from here.	O
We don't need flies.	O
There is kind of kind of flatten it all out and that's perfect.	O
We want for texture.	O
If I go ahead and press T here you can see it's not going to tile at all, but we're going to fix that after that I think.	O
What's the step?	CHITCHAT
We want to go straight into.	O
Adjustments maybe?	O
Maybe go straight into the.	O
Can use.	O
How are they I?	CHITCHAT
Hey, I'm material or materials needed channels or normal for Roughness Metallic Arheidt all that good stuff and we're just going with the computer.	O
So how you doing Sherry asked?	CHITCHAT
Just that you're Ramblin Whelan.	CHITCHAT

You better believe it.	CHITCHAT
I think I'll even do another tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
And then maybe?	CHITCHAT
Stressful week off animal.	CHITCHAT
I do another one tomorrow, then get into learning.	CHITCHAT
See brush off stream so.	CHITCHAT
Then come back in the other things look good, right?	CHITCHAT
So right away.	CHITCHAT
You can see the good old computer.	CHITCHAT
And it doesn't know this surface is flat, so nice, smooth, polished.	CHITCHAT
A piece of granite such trying his hardest to.	CHITCHAT
You still, I think, but it's doing is pushing the lighter colors and Panther.	CHITCHAT
Sorry lifting the lighter colors up and pushing the car comes down.	O
Now if you go ahead and look into our.	O
If you can kind of see what's going on.	O
But we don't want to know that this is going to be a super super basic materials, just a smooth granite.	O
So with that, I think.	CHITCHAT
Hi equalizer.	O
No, this is really think we're going to need to bring in.	O
Adjustment layer.	O
We definitely, Interestingly resting.	O
It doesn't get you to send anything like a whale.	O
That's the best time the down ticket.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I just want to kind of bring that down.	O
I don't really want any height here, just going to flatten it out on 1st.	O
The normal go goes as well.	O
You can kind of see.	CHITCHAT
Read here as I've panda light, there's a little bit of detail in the bottom left corner here.	O
It's cause issues.	O
That's because right now are normal map looks something like this.	O
We don't want that.	O
We want something perfectly smooth.	O
Super simple non material or certain habits here.	O
Yeah, my dry storage is full, yeah?	O
Where looks to Papa.	O
Just click.	O
See here.	CHITCHAT
Don't bring it down to it.	O
The high gloss here.	O
It's already, that's like not looking bad.	O
You can clearly see still that that we are not tiling, so.	O
Right now we haven't really done anything that would really make.	O
Anything complicated that you need alchemist for us so far right now.	O
We've done this taking a single picture and given it basically a bunch of blank Maps so that it looks a little bit nicer.	O
But this is for alchemist, really comes in handy, especially if you're just doing a simple thing like this.	O
I'm doing work on this one you'll see.	CHITCHAT
Just how powerful it is, but right now.	O
We're also not completely flat yet.	O
Right now we're going to just hop in here and hit it with this really nice little node.	O
Her filter I should say wild make it Tau advanced.	O
If you've ever tried to take a 2 themes like this and make it tileable.	O
So there's no seams.	O
You'll know it's a right pain in the butt.	O
Used to have to go into photo shop in Lake, shift everything over by half.	O
Do a bunch of menu blurring.	O
There's a whole thing, but now we get this sort of thing and I gotta do is slaters.	O
OK, so you can see as I move this.	O
You pay attention to the 2D here.	O
You see, it kind of spreads that line out.	O
We just find somewhere nice.	O

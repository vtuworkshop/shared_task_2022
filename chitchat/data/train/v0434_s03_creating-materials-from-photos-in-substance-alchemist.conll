Looking pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Learn a little bit.	CHITCHAT
And you're going to reach a point where you don't see those seems.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have a hard scene here.	O
My screen with a contrast there.	O
There's this whole too.	O
Yeah, I don't know if you have a Google Drive and it's not fully or not you're not using it right?	O
And let you guys days at the beauty that is the glass here.	O
Other part of my dinner real quick.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
What's for dinner?	CHITCHAT
I made?	CHITCHAT
Believe it or not I did Philly Cheese Steak again from those easy ones.	CHITCHAT
And when I did like this nice Buffalo.	CHITCHAT
Just so.	CHITCHAT
Again.	CHITCHAT
Right, so if we are.	CHITCHAT
Pull apart image that we started with it here.	O
We can see that our reference here is a lot darker.	O
Either we got going on here, so we're going to suggest that I don't know if I said this already, but this is.	O
A photo of my kitchen countertops that I took.	O
Nothing in two seconds.	O
Nothing fancy.	CHITCHAT
Even a little blurry, it's only help still.	O
Nevertheless, I'm going up down.	O
We're just going to bring down or luminosity a bit and bumper contrast.	O
And with the equalized knows, it kind of can wash everything everything out.	O
I said no clear said no.	O
Place.	O
We don't need a mirror finish on this summer.	O
It.	CHITCHAT
And as someone to point out.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I so very clearly see that is filing, especially with some of these more distinct figures like we have a bit of an arch here and you can see that repeating several times here.	O
And that's just one of the.	O
I'm just not really much you can do about that in the texture itself.	O
When you applied them too.	O
I didn't like.	CHITCHAT
Hop on a bill for global variation to help break it up a bit.	O
But what we can do is if it, if it really bothers us.	O
Here we go off.	CHITCHAT
It looks here.	CHITCHAT
We can bring in a clone patched.	O
I haven't tried this out yet.	O
But I believe.	CHITCHAT
We find our offending subject like this one right here.	O
And go in and out Click to set a reference point and then.	O
Kind of petery those details.	O
You see?	CHITCHAT
That one over here as well.	O
Note that here.	O
Certainly.	CHITCHAT
Set now let's let's undoing it.	O
Good to know.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
Video, then you can kind of paint away.	O

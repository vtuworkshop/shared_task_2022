This would be more useful if you have a picture of the ground and if there was like a cigarette, but early for something you wanted to get rid of.	O
This would definitely come in handy.	O
But we can do it for the granite here as well, just to get rid of.	O
Some of this more distinct features.	O
Good.	CHITCHAT
I guess already fixed the normal I already forgot about it, OK?	O
Just thinking to myself would be if we took this material and.	O
Did stuff with it.	O
Very descriptive thought I know, but what I'm saying is that would be cool to take it in like break it up into rocks like we did.	O
No reason we couldn't do that like.	O
Like the the trick with Alchemist is going to be that you kind of just need your base materials.	O
It's a bit confusing terminology considering.	O
Base material into the spec on saying it's like.	O
If you think about any any old material save ground material is just.	O
It's made up of.	O
A series of different.	O
Try not to use the word material over.	O
Of different substances like like a rocky ground might have a rock material in it, a dirty under.	O
Leaves and debris and then maybe some grass or Moss.	O
So if you have like those components broken down then you can kind of just make any old.	O
Anything you want with just those five, but every components in them.	O
Pikmin to Alchemist and.	O
And do what she really fun.	CHITCHAT
And was cookie.	CHITCHAT
After OK, so we got a pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Granite countertop material here.	O
And it's a lot like what's in my house, so.	O
It's gotta count for something.	O
Just add a little bit more.	O
Can you get a better look at it?	O
We can go ahead and.	O
Apparently, break everything.	O
Back Press the right button, then go ahead and look at it on a few different.	O
Objects here.	O
Like this Who created shoe?	O
Is cloth and looks really cool?	O
Maybe maybe it's a bit bit too glossy.	O
Turn that back a bit.	O
I gotta be honest, I want to add.	O
Some kind of roughness variation to this?	O
And it's very uniformly smooth and clean, but I haven't.	O
Really found the best way to do that.	O
Yet here designer at least.	O
I played around with like bringing in dust dirt.	O
She only did dust.	O
We can try dirt, don't know if it'll help though.	O
Taking lunch.	O
I don't think it would.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's very harsh on.	O
You don't really have.	O
The ability to change then.	O

But Ertz roughness here.	O
I basically just want to add a little bit of a noise over it.	O
If we could, we could end up with a mask.	O
Then headed noise texture on it, but.	O
Still need a way to.	O
And exclude.	O
Dirt from.	O
Have you done any color information?	O
Please give it.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to say.	O
I think that's that's kind of terrible.	O
You pass, it doesn't seem to do much.	O
I forgot about that.	O
Right, right this variation for the time being.	O
Now not to look into that and see if there's anything we could.	O
And it's actually.	O
You took the shine down a little bit too much.	O
Seems about right for those countertops.	O
I am so Super Simple.	O
As Super simple of material here might bring it back and play with it later, but for now we're going to move on to a image that's slightly more complex.	O
Not terribly so, but.	O
And it has a little bit more going on to it will have a little bit of death.	O
I didn't get that open.	O
Add a couple of pictures of just some country from my backyard and also apparently tomatoes in the corner said look at that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, not a, not a Queen photo, not great lighting conditions, but I want to see what we can do with these.	O
Stick with.	O
First one.	O
All I'm gonna do.	CHITCHAT
Add new material, OK, whatever.	O
Grab it on over.	O
And for now, we just need to the map.	O
Write software to R2D view here.	O
We are going to go ahead and right off the bat rolled down a rock.	O
And then I'm going to switch over.	O
That switch over to scan your excuse me deep.	O
Turn off that for now.	O
'cause right now we don't have a base color or any other channels because it's the material is just an image at the moment.	O
And so we got the image shared.	O
And look down here in the bottom left.	O
Traffic look down here in the bottom left hand.	O
We're going to look at those.	O
That resolution number Henry had put that in here.	O
But it right?	CHITCHAT
3032 by in 1961.	O
But It is often photo so.	O
I expect right?	O
Then we get that let's go ahead and.	O
It's going to drop this if we go out and Turner crop on.	O
Doing a little bit better.	O
Mildly.	O
Almost easier just to leave it like that.	O
I think we're going to grab.	O
The side we're going to head little naked square button.	O
Would be nice and square.	O
You know what I might go for?	O
Something in the center here.	O
So now let's crop.	O
We go ahead and.	O
Best resolution is it.	O
Wouldn't add a equalizer.	O
To try to balance data lighting.	O
Nice and subtle.	CHITCHAT

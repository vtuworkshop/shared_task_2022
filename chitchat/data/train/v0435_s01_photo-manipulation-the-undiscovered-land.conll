And if you find that useful, do command to let me know if it's useful and will let me know what other things that you guys want to learn.	O
They'll be great as well so that I can stream something that you guys want.	O
And if you see each and every episode that I go live on, each of these manipulation will have its own style, right?	O
There are things that you can learn.	O
They are very different from each other.	O
You learn different things, blending imagers, masking, and Calibrating and stuff.	O
So if you guys have any questions asked me an you get any suggestions, do let me know in the comment box right beside the stream anchovy class saying Hi, Thumbs up.	O
I shall be car Linkara Pinkett Ratnam, Rahman incorrectly.	O
Cool where you from.	CHITCHAT
Cool um?	CHITCHAT
You know what?	CHITCHAT
For today?	CHITCHAT
I think it would be nice to just come.	O
Create something that I've done.	O
This is inspired from my own work that I've done like three years ago.	O
I think I think would be nice to create a serial like you know how like undiscovered land looks like.	O
This is the image one of this.	O
I'm not sure if you guys can see, let me see.	CHITCHAT
My webcam can focus on it.	CHITCHAT
Right, a lot of people thought This is like a real image.	O
I slightly blurry.	O
Write something like this.	O
They go right like very surreal.	O
Also have this.	O
So the trick is to make it look real.	O
That's a challenge.	O
I do have a lot of comments saying that.	O
Is is this stuff that you've done is real or is it like manipulation?	O
Or can we go somewhere and see it?	O
So yeah, it depends how you manipulate stuff.	O
So in this live stream you get to learn.	O
How to create a cereals in OK?	O
Is my audio good?	CHITCHAT
Is everybody good?	CHITCHAT
Shishan is saying Good Morning?	CHITCHAT
How are you good morning and thank you for joining my stream again?	CHITCHAT
OK, without further ado, let's get started.	O
I will just switch to photo shop.	O
There you go, as you can see I am actually.	O
Um, using the wider landscape, right?	O
'cause I want to have something in mind an for that it requires a bigger converse than a normal one.	O
Normal will be the square one.	O
So of course, first thing first, before you start, you need to know the concept and before you even go in and do all the masking and edging out all the stuff.	O
I want you guys to do composition.	O
So first thing first, I'm going to just drag in the.	O
Background that I have.	O
So this is the background I have.	O
With me here, right?	O
I'm going to just.	O
Move this slightly down just like that.	O
I can't remember where these photos taken it from the other V stock.	O
I can't remember the value, but this looks so good like exactly what I have in mind, so I'm going to do all the placement.	O
Of this talk images.	O
And then we're going to go in and do all the editing so you will know what I'm going to create.	O
As I added more stuff, cool.	O
So let's get in more stock images.	O
So I also have this hikers.	O
So I'm going to just place them at the bottom.	O
This is just a rough composition.	O
I might change it later.	O
So I'm going to just.	O
Lower down the opposite E.	O
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
I think that works OK.	O
I'm going to just leave it just like that.	O
Just lower down the opposite day so I can see them in the background.	O
That's perfect.	CHITCHAT
Good morning everybody.	CHITCHAT
Who's watching how high Claudia.	CHITCHAT
Hi, how are you?	CHITCHAT
Thank you for joining.	CHITCHAT
And I also have.	CHITCHAT
There's.	CHITCHAT
Actually, this is a temple in Valley.	O
I visited this temple before but for this image I just need these stairs.	O
So where the stars goes we will wait and see I'll just kill it.	O
Really small.	O
Let's zoom in OK, lower down the opposite E.	O
I wanna place it somewhere here.	O
Will do the adjustment later on.	O
You'll know what I'm trying to create.	O
Here is like a serial sin.	O
And I also have.	O
Helicopters?	O
Let's move this up.	O
Probably will scale small later on.	O
But for now, just please sit there.	O
Will be smaller maybe?	O
They go not sure about sites yet.	O

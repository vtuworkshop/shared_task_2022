I'll know later on after I added in more of the start menu.	O
I also have another leak after.	O
So what's happening?	CHITCHAT
Why is that a lot of helicopters and stuff you will know in just a few minutes?	O
So before the I'll just do the placement.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
It's perfect, let me see if there's any most documents I need.	O
I do have one more, and I do have the main stock images.	O
I'll bring it later on.	O
This I would like to place it.	O
Later.	CHITCHAT
Right at the edge of the mountain.	O
I'll just kill this small.	O
Move it up.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, the placements are all OK.	O
Now I'm going to just quickly hide the stairs.	O
And I'm going to bring in the main stock image.	O
That would be.	O
Big initial statue.	O
I'm going to place it onto the mountain as if it's being caused from the mountain itself.	O
So I'm.	CHITCHAT
Going to resize it.	O
OK, I need to quickly hide the rest of this talk images so that I get the right view.	O
They go, I'll just load on the upper city.	O
So that I know where I'm going to place it, I think this place.	O
Here this looks good.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to just leave it just like that.	O
Perfect so I have helicopters coming in and going out.	O
And I also have waterfall at the top there.	O
And then we just leave it there.	O
Also have the Stars to go to the.	O
As you just like a temple underneath finisher, so there's also the background and the hikers.	O
So first thing first, we need to do so.	O
There's also a few elements that you guys will learn for this live stream where.	O
I will be using shapes right to connect to the helicopters and stuff underneath as if they're carrying stuff.	O
So let me just explain what's going on.	O
So while I was going through some stock images yesterday to see what I'm going to swim today, right?	O
I saw this statue and I was thinking it would be nice to create like.	O
I think you can see from the title, except that undiscovered Latin, right?	O
So be nice to just have this moment I still wear.	O
Archaeologist they found this place where this is not discovered before.	O
It was like maybe 500 years ago.	O
Len that was not discovered yet and they found it.	O
And they're doing some sort of like.	O
2nd acting like they just want to see what's what's being used, what items that they can see.	O
They can investigate and find out how long this temple have been there, who made it and stuff like that.	O
So that kind of scene.	O
If you get what I mean.	O
So it's like those Indiana Jones or mummy movies and stuff, right so?	O
Let's get started up so I would like to start with the UM.	O
Statue.	O
Right and the background.	O
So I'm going to hide the stairs, so let me just move in.	O
Zoom in and I going to do.	O
Select subject As you all know, if you all watch my previous streams, just press W in a keyboard and press the select subject.	O
OK cool uhm, I'm OK with this.	CHITCHAT
If it smells like that, OK, perfect and I'm going to just like asking.	CHITCHAT
There you go, right?	CHITCHAT
I kind of like the placement here, even though this part is not selected.	O
Somehow it works for me because I'm going to do a bit of blending images that I'm going to teach you guys in a bit and also if you notice the background and the statue is not right.	O
I mean it comes to like levels and contrast, right?	O
So we're going to adjust that and I'm going to do a bit of cleaning.	O
Let me just.	CHITCHAT
Press there and here perfect.	O
I going to do masking there.	O
I'm going to remove that background and this.	O
That is good.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's do a bit of blending here, so let's go in here.	O
And we need to do a bit of like a cleaning.	O
So before that I'll just show in height.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
That's how it looks like.	O
So let's choose the right brush.	O
For example, I'm using my favorite, the brush tool oil base.	O
Festival brush lower down the flow.	O
And this is how you do the blending, right?	O
You have to imagine other so whenever I do my work, I imagine myself being there and I want to make sure that.	O
That it blends like this as if there's like.	O

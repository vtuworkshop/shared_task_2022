There's like a grass on top of the statue and stuff I think would be nice to have that an.	O
They go a bit there.	O
Right, This is how you do blending again.	O
What I'm doing right now is I'm just masking it.	O
So like this, and I'll be there.	O
I'll hide this part.	O
I'll probably leave this part of the Lake of lot condition.	O
So even this statue looks very very ancient.	O
I just downloaded from the stock images.	O
It works for my manipulation and I gotta move at a site.	O
You can see the edges here is very rough, so I'm going to do.	O
Like this, right?	CHITCHAT
You can see.	O
How it blends?	O
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
I would like to do a bit of cleaning on the edges, so let's load on the size of the reduce the size of the brush and I'm going to do this kind of cleaning.	O
I'm going to move my cursor down here.	O
Just like that.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Lilly, say Hi Little.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do a bit more adjustment to the edges.	O
OK, this time I only increase the flow because it's a sharp edge, right?	O
And sure, OK, I'm going to stop this part over here because I can under different types of blending, going to continue down here.	O
Perfect if you zoom out, you get to see as if the statue is right.	O
Part of the mounted right on this spot.	O
Here I would like to use a softer brush.	O
To do my skin, just as if it's connected the middle part over here, how are you?	O
I'm doing good how are you you?	O
Little thanks for joining the stream and here I'm going to do this blending.	O
As if it scoffed.	O
Discussed on from the stone itself.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
They go.	CHITCHAT
You don't have to worry about the colours yet, we will fix.	O
Later on, so here's what I'm doing.	O
Right and trying to merge the mountains at the back there.	O
With the statue.	O
And if you're thinking if it's if it's from this, if it's comfortable from the store from the mountain wise, the color different well make sense.	O
We going to change that very quickly.	O
OK I am going to just.	O
Brush this little more.	O
OK, let's zoom out.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like it.	O
OK, I'm going to do a bit more here.	O
As if it's like in between the statue.	O
Always, always imagine that you are there.	O
We have 17 people watching life right now.	O
Hello to each and everyone of you.	O
If you mind saying where you guys from that we create so that we can chit chat while I get this done.	O
Well, I haven't do this kind of like her when you push it for quite some time.	O
Right, if you look at my Instagram you get to see this like two years ago I think.	O
OK, we will probably do more investment later on.	O
But right now I'm going to.	O
Teach you guys how to do color corrections, so right above the statue will just group it very quickly.	O
Right, let's call this statue.	O
Right above the statue I want you to just create a new layer, let's call it um, contrast.	O
Because we're going to change the compressors.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Just perfect and I want you to press on alternate.	O
They go so you that you get the masking effect here is clipping mask and I want you to just press on.	O
I should've kept for color pink and I want you to look for a grade point.	O
If you couldn't get the right great point is it's fine.	O
If you don't get it, just use the color picker here.	O
I want you to choose the middle, but the middle, uhm within the spectrum, so the middle Gray area and click OK and I want you to change your tool to bucket and Drop it in.	O
OK, you get that.	O
Of course that doesn't make sense, right?	O
So I want you to blow it down the opposite E.	O
And I want you to slowly increase it and I want you to look at the statue.	O
See how the contrast is now.	O
Working as in it has the same type of what he called.	O
A fate effect, right?	O

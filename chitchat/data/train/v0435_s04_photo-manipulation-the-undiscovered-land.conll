So you can see the further you go beyond the mountain is slightly faded.	O
Even this part over here, right?	O
If you look at this point, here is all faded.	O
Similarly to the mountains over here, it's not.	O
It's not so contrast, so that's what that's the reason why I added contrast here.	O
You can always use the adjustment layer, go to the brightness and contrast, but I love using this traditional way of making contrast because.	O
I'm in control of this by acting control amount of contractor.	O
I won the color and stuff like that.	O
We have producing rubbish, very interesting, excellent life.	O
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Claudia.	CHITCHAT
OK, that works and I'm going to do this part of here.	O
I would like to do a bit of adjustment.	O
I'll just change my brush to something more sharper.	O
Any decrease the size of my brush and I'll just do that.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Push up little better.	O
OK, so of course the statue color and the mountain valleys slightly different.	O
I want to do a color balance at ready for that, simply go down here and choose color balance.	O
And I want you to adjust.	O
The blue.	O
Because it's slightly blueish and it's also right.	O
So let's see which one works better.	O
Write some.	O
We might slide it to see which one works better.	O
And I will be applying color look after this so you don't have to adjust so much.	O
Just.	CHITCHAT
The right amount will do.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
They go.	CHITCHAT
OK, it's getting there.	CHITCHAT
Probably I will increase the contrast a little more.	O
Not so much the slowdown.	O
Perfect, we also need to.	O
Decrease the brightness.	O
Let's go down here and choose Hue and saturation.	O
I want you to reduce the lightness.	O
Right, not so much they go.	O
So another thing you need to also find out where is the light comes from right for instant.	O
For this image I think is coming from the more or less from the top.	O
But The thing is, it's not so sharp the shadows because it's slightly gloomy, right?	O
So that's the reason why it's not so shut the shadows so you don't have to worry.	O
Will adjust the light later on an I'm not so happy with the colour balance.	O
I would like to increase the red or reduce bit there.	O
Let's increase the magenta.	O
So that it has a bit of green tint.	O
Ann Maybe a bit of.	O
Blue OK, that looks good.	O
So it's like a part of the mountain.	O
OK, next we going there.	O
At in more lights for the statue, can you see the top part of the mountains that always have this white filter on it?	O
So I'm going to do that.	O
I'm going to create a new layer.	O
Press alt and it.	O
This call may be light.	O
I want you to reduce the canvas go to gradient.	O
An, uh, make sure you color is a white and then you get to have this gradient in White Lego.	O
I want you to just drop.	O
The gradient is like this.	O
Can you see that?	CHITCHAT
Right so, but rather than putting it on the statue, I want you to move up the light.	O
And Drop it like that.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
This is the overall light.	O
It can be too much.	O
I want you to just lower down.	O
Just lightly so that it blends with the background as well, because if you do it in the statue then you have to do adjustment on the background.	O
So let's just drop a light.	O
On top of the canvas.	O
Just like this.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
That works so that now it's part of the.	O
What do you call mountain?	O
Photo Converse Perfect.	O
An time to do a bit of like touch ups to the background.	O
So because I want to do a bit of like what he called.	O
Shadow effects from the statue create a new layer right on top of the background.	O
Let's call this shadow.	O
It's called this.	O
Statues shadows that you.	O
Shadow perfect Ann.	O
I am going to use.	O
Bigger brush.	O
Increase my breast size.	O
So if you're wondering how I increase my brushes, I'm using the bracket.	O
Symbol on my keyboard.	O
And I'm going to choose soft light.	O
Let's see if that works right.	O

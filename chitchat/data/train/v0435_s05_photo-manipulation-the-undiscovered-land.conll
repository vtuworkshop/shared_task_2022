There you go.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add shadows here.	O
As you can see right this part over here.	O
Maybe not too much.	O
In, let's see if the normals OK, rather than using soft light will be better to use normal without any blending.	O
OK, and I want you to just zoom in here.	O
An ad in shadows way.	O
It makes sense, for example.	O
This but over here.	O
OK, we will add more shadows to the statue in a bit, but for now.	O
Let's absolution.	O
Let's reduce the flow, not so much.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
They go over here.	O
And how you guys doing?	CHITCHAT
I have 24 people watching online.	CHITCHAT
Hello to everybody.	CHITCHAT
Right this, but the shadow?	O
Zoom in here.	O
OK, that works maybe more.	O
They go here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Little bit over there.	O
Has increased the brush size.	O
May be subtle ones at the site you can see I reduce my flow to 15 'cause I do wanna harsh.	O
Shadow, because as you can see, the overall lighting is very gloomy.	O
Let's not add very flashlight because then you would look so real.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK, next I am going to.	O
Their light that we have fixed on top of the layer.	O
I wanted to reduce slightly a bit more because I think it's a bit too much.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Perfect, then why don't we just add on to look up before we proceed?	O
OK so I have something in mind for color look up.	O
I want to use the.	O
Let's see I have, uh.	O
2D street doesn't work.	O
Let's see how the colors.	O
I have few.	O
Foggy night is not something I'm looking for.	O
Yes, drop blue, So what drop blue does is that it reduces the amount of blue and I don't really like the blue.	O
I kind of like the drop loose so once you drop that you can see how their blue taken away from the elephant on the throne definition statue.	O
Right, you can see how it blends well now the colors are more or less the same.	O
And now I want you to go to the.	O
Layer of the leaders of the statue.	O
Create shadow.	O
And I want you to mask it.	O
Like that and I want you to use the same settings that we've done for the shadow.	O
An ad in shadows way it makes sense, for example.	O
Just bought a party right?	O
Obviously because the light is coming from the top to the bottom, part has to have that shadow.	O
So here's what I'm doing.	O
I'm adding shadows.	O
An important part of the statue of blood pressure.	O
Eagle Just little we can always adjust the amount of shadows.	O
Sure, and I'm I'm just following the black black spots of statue.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
That looks realistic.	CHITCHAT
Go down.	O
And set in motion this year.	O
Over here at the bottom part of the hand.	O
And here.	CHITCHAT
Cool, see you can always adjust from the opposite E.	O
That's what we have done like we created like 100% you can see the amount of shadows let's really reduce it to at least 7 T.	O
100%.	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Nice so now.	CHITCHAT
We're not done with the statue yet.	O
We're going to bring in more stock images, right?	O
So I am going to close the statue, uhm?	O
Grouped layers for now and I'm going to bring in the hikers.	O
So the hikers are there, they don't know that this place is.	O
Undiscovered before this so I am going to crop them out.	O
Imagine there hiking and then they came here and there like.	O
Well, what's going on right?	O
And I want to do obviously exit them out.	O
So let's do select subject.	O
Let's zoom in and see if everything is OK.	O
Not really, so I'm going to just press L.	O

And I'm going to select even this part of the.	O
Stock image.	O
So what I'm doing right now is I'm using polygonal lasso is one of my favorite tool to edge out stuff.	O
This is very clean.	CHITCHAT
They go like that and I will just must them.	O
Right, but The thing is, they're not so sharp yet.	O
Let's do a bit.	O
Obviously have to do also a color change here.	O
For example, they don't blend with the background at all, and for that I would like to duplicate them first.	O
I want to use the a multiply.	O
But not so much because it will really ruin the.	O
Quality of it.	O
So I'm going to just reduce the opposite.	O
Is slightly like this and I want to just select board of this layers and I just group it and I call it.	O
Hikers.	O
Perfect and I will change the color now.	O
So I'll just create open up Hue and saturation.	O
Press alternate Ann.	O
Let's reduce the amount of colors that we have.	O
Right and also I think it would be nice to just dumping them a bit, so the focus is more towards the statue, not them that just that too.	O
Observe what's going on, so they're not really important character in this scene.	O
And also I will love to fix.	O
The contrast, and for that, like I've done for the statue.	O
Point find the Middle Gray.	O
I want you to call this contrast.	O
And drop the color.	O
Onto them they go and I want you to reduce the amount of contrast.	O
Just like this.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
We make them slightly darker later on, so for now just.	O
Leave it like this.	O
Perfect we will now change the color balance of this two hikers so that it's it's the.	O
Manipulation.	O
Who any questions so far you guys good?	O
Some doing some adjustment.	O
I'm bringing the blue.	O
And also a bit of Green.	O
And the green works for this one.	O
OK I am going to add in a bit of shadow at the back of them.	O
So create new layer called shadow.	O
Choose gradient.	O
Make sure green is black, OK and I want you to just.	O
Move out from the canvas just like this and drag the greedy and they go that works.	O
That is exactly what I want.	O
Right, if you want to add more touch ups, you can.	O
What you can do is you just make sure your curse your breast size bigger and just add in the shadows like this.	O
That, for example, what I'm doing is I'm doing some adjustments to the shadow.	O
I'm editing the doctor spots are I want to add.	O
More shadows at the back.	O
Again, the main character is.	O
Indonesia statue.	O
Oh my stream is keep on buffering my first live stream of you are now.	O
Then she's saying I've been watching people stream today, set my alarm or thank you so much.	O
Dennis hopefully you're streaming gets better.	O
Probably is the.	O
The connection issues.	O
But everything looks fine from my end.	O
I am checking my connection now and then.	CHITCHAT
Everything looks good.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully you get fixed.	O
For you version and I'm going to the hike is very quickly.	O
I would like to musket.	O
Zoom and do appear of cleaner.	O
I'm going to use a very sharp brush.	O
Let's use this.	O
And I'm going to clean up.	O
I'm very, very strict when it comes to like white outlines like this.	O
I need to make sure that it's clean.	O
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
Boom, that that works and I want to clean up the hand.	O
Yes, that works.	O
Let's move down here.	O
The edges is not so clear and not clean enough.	O
So I'm going to do.	O
Bit of clean up here.	O

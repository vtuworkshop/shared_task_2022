Let's see if there's more.	CHITCHAT
That works, they go.	CHITCHAT
So imagine they're looking at the statue right now.	O
Great, that works.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's do a bit of color adjustment to the hikers.	O
Again, I'm not a happy person yet.	O
Yeah, increasing the green works for this one.	O
Perfect, we have 20 people watching online.	CHITCHAT
Hello to everybody.	CHITCHAT
And this white is bothering me on to do a bit of masking here.	O
A clone stamping, actually.	O
Fixes I call it fixes.	O
I switched my tool to stamp close them and this thing is bothering me.	O
What I'm going to do is I'm going to just.	O
Speak something from here and put it there.	O
Right, as if this like a white space that's rather than.	O
There you go, that works.	O
Next I am going to add in a bit of color tint again.	O
This time I'm looking for color filter.	O
Yeah, I'm looking for a bit like a Brown.	O
Shades around the.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
It's like about to be like sunset again.	O
I'm not sure you probably fix the color later, but for now this works an I have few more.	O
Now, it's wonderful, perfect Danish.	O
OK I am going to bring in more of the.	O
Stock images, as you can see, there's also a waterfall I think.	O
Would be nice to add a waterfall at the back of the mountain.	O
Right, let me just make that really big Lego an outlet to remove the other part of the.	O
Waterfall, like all this month is, I just need the water flow so press W select subject.	O
Let's see if that works.	O
Perfect the water is elected, but we still have to do a bit of adjustment.	O
No problem, just press on the masking tool 1st and I want you to press select and mask and we need to do more refining here.	O
So I am going to increase my breast size.	O
I need to remove.	O
The other part of the waterfall that's not needed.	O
I just need the water.	O
We can do a bit of cleaning later on for now.	O
This works.	O
And then click OK.	CHITCHAT
Right, I want you to just scale it.	O
And put it at the site of the mountain, but I don't need to flow this slide.	O
I want it to be that side.	O
So in order to switch to flip it just right click and flip horizontal.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
So I'm moving up here, not so much there.	O
OK, I'm going to right click and also press Q 'cause I want to push the waterfall.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
Right, perfect, let's zoom in.	O
Here and of course we have to do a bit of cleanup and I want to move.	O
The powerful somewhere here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's do a bit of cleanup crew.	O
Press V and choose a soft brush.	O
Anne, I want you to clean all this white ears.	O
This is not needed.	O
All this white peers.	O
I just need the two little waterfalls.	O
I mean one huge ones and once moments.	O
You brush up this now.	O
Just like this, as if it's flowing down here, right?	O
And we're going to do a bit of clean up here.	O
They go.	CHITCHAT
Again, what I'm doing right now is I am just.	O
Removing the unwanted.	O
Subjects around the waterfall.	O
Right, I'm also cleaning up here.	O
Networks and sure.	O
Is going there an perfect?	O
He left the waterfall BNI on going to also.	O
This reduced the amount of the steam.	O
Hey Joanna hi, I'm looking forward to see the final result in learning a lot from the tips.	CHITCHAT
Yay hey John, I said here.	CHITCHAT

I'm doing super good.	CHITCHAT
How are you today saying what's up blue side?	O
I am doing super good so I'm doing this like a undiscovered land.	O

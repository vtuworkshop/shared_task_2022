So I'm doing this.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's.	CHITCHAT
It's just too intense.	O
OK go that works OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to just leave it just like that.	O
Probably do a bit of like a.	O
Maple.	O
It works.	CHITCHAT
And more cleaned up here.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
And then if you notice right, the waterfall is is too bright.	O
Where else the backgrounds like after so we need to make sure that it matches the background, so we're going to do is we will create a adjustment right?	O
We go to here in saturation and want you to mask it.	O
They got musket and then on the waterfall I want you to reduce the levels are the lightness of it, sorry.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
When you do that then it matches the background.	O
If you don't do that, I will be soon too bright.	O
For example, we can show you different after I put the zero.	O
And you can see how bright it is, so we're going to reduce that, right?	O
Uhm?	CHITCHAT
That works, I think, that sees a lot.	O
Yeah, that's perfect.	O
So we're going to leave the waterfall there for a bit.	O
An everything looks good and.	O
Hello people who's watching online?	CHITCHAT
How are you guys?	CHITCHAT
Wow, I have 20 people watching online.	CHITCHAT
Hello everybody.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, cool.	CHITCHAT
Next Like I said earlier, right?	CHITCHAT
Dumb.	CHITCHAT
This is this is a scene where the archaeologists found like few months ago so, and of course they need to do some sort of like aligning.	O
Know like how they do the police line.	O
Do not cross.	O
I think it would be nice to put that in and also I just notice one thing that I forgot to reduce the hearing saturation for the background because the green here is just too right and it's just.	O
Two vibrant so let's go to the background an choose Hue and saturation.	O
Reduce the amount of saturation.	O
Is just too green.	O
There you go, that works.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't have it too.	O
Two shining two Greenie Lego that works.	O
Perfect and I am going to add in those lines, you know, like do not go beyond this line.	O
So in order to do that I am going to.	O
Create a new layer here called.	O
A barrier.	O
And I'm going to use the shapes.	O
Let's group that very quickly shadows here.	O
Everything here is background so that we don't get confused of all the layers.	O
This is very little ears.	O
Usually when I do my photo manipulation take flight.	O
Hundreds of years Barrier Control G.	O
Let's call this very again.	O
OK, I want you to guys.	O
To use tools like this, like for example what I'm doing right now is I am going to create a barrier.	O
But it's too big.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if I can reduce.	O
To Gray.	O
So far I'm loving the process and I a perfect.	O
OK, that's good.	CHITCHAT
OK, so reduce the number of pixels again, look up to my canvas up here.	O
I'm moving my cursor reduced to at least two 'cause what I'm doing right now is I am going to imagine there's a line here that the psychologist have placed.	O
So I'm going to draw a line.	O
So this line is to say do not come through.	O
Do not go beyond this lines.	O
Right, do not go beyond this lines.	O
Because we're doing some sort of like a research.	O
Right, OK, there you go.	CHITCHAT
The line and then I will add in.	O
Like a like a like a small little steals.	O
So I'll choose a color from the spectrum here without the color and just place it here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'll do the adjustment of the colours very quickly later on, so for now I'm going to just keep on duplicating this.	O
And place it where it needs to be.	O
For example, it should be here.	O
And it should be here.	O
Again, what I'm doing is I'm just duplicating it.	O
It should be there.	O
Let's duplicating it one more time.	O
Let's play sit here.	O
We always can fix this later on the spaces.	O

Let's Bring in more of the steel here so if I don't put this barrier that doesn't make sense right?	O
Because this place is did not allow public to enter, so that's what I imagine.	O
So let's create more barrier here.	O
Yeah the rest weekend because he said this, and so there's no point of adding it there, so I'm going to adjust this one here.	O
So just press CTRL key, an zoom in and drag it.	O
Lego lyrics.	O
Perfect right?	CHITCHAT
So now we're going to create.	O
Hello, just means for this.	O
So here on the barrier just create a new layer called 2 and saturation.	O
Musket.	O
And reduce the amount of lightness.	O
Not so much.	O
Still is visible.	O
Again, this likely 100% size, so it's OK if you add more details to it.	O
For now it looks like a.	O
Like you do not answer this space kind of thing.	O
And I'm also going to add in more lines.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT
Just like this, so that there's like a end.	O
Oops, that's not the right color.	O
Let's switch back to the original color.	O
There you go.	O
That's that works, and I'm going to adjust that.	O
So that's connected bagel.	O
Perfect right?	CHITCHAT
So these guys cannot go beyond this line.	O
Next I am going to bring in the helicopters.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
We have one up there.	O
So these are the guys who will be doing the research.	O
For example at the back of this statue, there's another temple that yet to be.	O
I mean, they already discovered they're doing some sort of like a research, the bringing stuff they want to make sure.	O
Like, uh, What is this temple about?	O
Who built this and stuff like that?	O
So it's like a research, so I need to crop this image and in order to do that I'll just go to the helicopter and I'll just press W and press select subject.	O
Let's see if the helicopter is.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Can be better, but it's OK for now.	O
I'll do clean up very quickly.	O
There you go, that works and I wine I'm going to.	O
Uh, press on slack and mask.	O
I'm going to do clean up here because they are some items I need.	O
To be seen.	O
This edges is very important.	O
OK, let's clean up the edges.	O
I think that works, click OK.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
See because it's underneath the light.	O
Now it looks real like the helicopter is there.	O
We're going to add in more stuff onto the helicopter, right?	O
For now we will leave it there and we also have another leak after which is right here.	O
It's like people are just getting busy, right?	O
People going left and right OK?	O
For this one.	O
Let's do the same thing.	O
Let's just group this before I get confused helicopter, an waterfall let's also.	O
Groupid.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
So that there's that, let's press W an select subject.	O
Perfect, of course.	O
This part of the helicopter is not selected.	O
Will adjust very quickly.	O
Let's go in here.	O
OK, let's select and mask.	O
And do the cleanup.	O
Right, we don't need the white edges here.	O
That works.	CHITCHAT
And I have this.	O
I need to bring back the blade.	O
I have one more bleak here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
That is cleaned.	CHITCHAT
We will do more manual adjustment underneath here in a bit, OK.	O
Zoom out perfect and I want to.	O
Do a menu fixing.	O
Let's find the shop brush going here.	O

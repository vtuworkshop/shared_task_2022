This part over here.	O
I was getting doctor this early on the light.	O
I think OK, perfect we have to do color adjustment and contrast adjustment for this helicopter.	O
That works like perfectly, but we need to do adjustment for this one.	O
You need to do.	CHITCHAT
You need to look a bit darker.	O
So let's create an you come.	O
Effect.	O
Right underneath the helicopter just press alt and it so this mask and I wanted to reduce the lightness.	O
Because you need to understand how likeness will trade.	O
For example, if you're standing on the peak of a mountain and you see a lot of mountains in front of you, the further it is, the more faded it will be.	O
The nearer it is to you, it will be a little darker.	O
Similarly, when it comes to this situation.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
You need to make sure that components that's in front is way darker than the other ones.	O
OK, that works.	CHITCHAT
Cool an I'll just close this very quickly.	O
They go so you can see it's like a busy scene like this guys are watching what's going on and you not allowed to enter that's happening and also forget to add in there stairs.	O
This is this is actually.	O
A body temple, for example, images show you the picture right.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
That's the body temple, but I just need the stairs, so I'm going to place this.	O
Let me just check this or above the waterfall layer Lego.	O
An I'm going to reduce the opacity so that I can put in the stairs and I don't like the angle because it's from.	O
Anything up from this site and I want to move security at the site, so that's the keyword skew.	O
Right click on it and.	O
Choose skew.	O
Citing sitting taking notes from streams are.	O
Only time I do they have any word yay thank you.	O
And let's use this start.	O
So when you distort, you get that.	O
OK, let's see if I place.	O
Build stairs.	O
Right, let's move it more so this talk a bit more.	O
You can even skew it.	O
That works OK.	CHITCHAT
For now I'll just do that and I will.	O
Fix the angle.	O
For example, it has to look like this larger perspective, right?	O
So you need to do this adjustment.	O
Some bring these points up so that.	O
I can place it right there, right?	O
So imagining is being there an I am going to do masking.	O
Musk.	O
Bringing in my shop.	O
Brush and I'm going to do this.	O
Very quickly just ignore this part of the stairs.	O
Increase my brush brush brush brush brush brush.	O
Erase the rest.	O
OK, and I am.	O
Not so happy with these stairs.	O
Angle is what I'm going to do.	O
I'm gonna reduce.	O
Size and I'm going to press the start.	O
They go.	CHITCHAT
Now it's.	CHITCHAT
It's perfectly legal, so as if people can go out there and look at the statue.	O
I'm going to blend this image.	O
So for that I'm going to do a bit of masking.	O
Again, let's press on B brush, reduce the flow, not so much.	O
OK, as if it's blending.	O
With the grass.	O
So you have to imagine again it's all about imagining.	O
I want to imagine you are there right now and I'm following.	O
The structure of the stairs to guide me through how am I going to clean it up?	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Right, that works here.	CHITCHAT
And I like the steps because it's like it has some leaves and whatever wet leaves it matches my manipulation.	O

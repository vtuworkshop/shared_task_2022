We learn how to merge.	O
2 images together.	O
We even created the waterfall.	O
We're fairly copters coming in.	O
We have more stuff to actually.	O
We also have a two hikers or kind of like loss, but they found this place over here.	O
They just wondering what's going on.	O
OK, an I.	CHITCHAT
We have one more hour and I'm I'm going really fast.	O
Maybe I should slow down, how's everybody?	O
So earlier before I start, I actually showing.	O
My not sure if you guys can see.	O
Let me try this one more time.	CHITCHAT
So this other stuff that I've done like three years ago.	O
Right like?	CHITCHAT
There.	CHITCHAT
But I like creating like those Indiana Jones.	O
Um, what do you call it the scene?	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Right this all not real and I do have a lot of people ask me if this place is really want to visit or be like amazes.	O
Such place exists, so it's like a waterfall is a temple.	O
Cool and yeah, if you guys any questions, do feel free to ask me.	O
Now I have one more out go but I'm going like super fast.	O
Semi true farce.	O
Probably not.	O
And I'm going to just group.	O
So what I'm doing right now I'm just going to.	O
Group my layers.	O
Before anything various their perfect, I grouped everything already, so for now.	O
So I was thinking I think it would be nice to come because like I said before, right?	O
This is undiscovered land and they found this place and they're doing some research.	O
It would be nice to bring some stones out of this land and go and do some research so in how do they do that?	O
Of course they need to use helicopter to move things around and I thought would be nice too.	O
This I'm going to bring in more stuff.	O
It would be nice to box it up the stuff that they gather into a crate like a wooden crate.	O
So I'm going to just.	O
OK, another thing, do you see this over here?	O
It's upside down as it.	O
And then it's not the right angle.	O
If I placed it underneath the helicopter, right?	O
There's a trick for this.	O
All you have to do is just flip it vertical so it looks like it's floating.	O
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
Cool press W.	O
For select subject boom.	O
Anne just musket.	O
We will do color adjustment in a bit, but for now I am going to resize it.	O
Very small.	O
So that as if the helicopter is bringing this research item to the land.	O
I'm going to sit here.	O
Just like that, and I'm going to just move it.	O
Tilted a bit because this is because it's moving rates heavy and stuff.	O
Um, like this?	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to do a color adjustment to it.	O
Because it's it wouldn't, but then it's too bright, right?	O
So let's go to.	CHITCHAT
Q Institution Nope, you're going incorrect speed.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Sir Rica.	CHITCHAT
So at first, but then over here.	O
Perfect, let's create that one contrast layer above the crit.	O
And call it.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
And I am going to get a darker shade of rather than the Middle Greer.	O
I'm going to take a document because it's just too bright.	O
And just use the bucket, dump it in.	O
First G OK and reduce the opposite E.	O
OK, let's do more and see if that makes sense.	O
Kinda, but we will need to do more adjustment.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let's choose.	O
Cut this but off the contrast.	O
I think I don't need this.	O
Control V.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
We will just go to the create.	O
And go to the brightness and contrast and.	O
Decrease.	O
The brightness.	O
Yeah, that works.	O
Perfect this contrast.	O
I think we can switch back through the original color light, agree an dump in.	O
I'm just finding out the right color because you can see right?	O
All because the helicopter is already dark color, so you have to use.	O

That seemed color wouldn't work for this one because it's Brown, right?	O
So let's just try it out.	CHITCHAT
See, you won't work.	O
Only darkish, so I'm just getting colors from the mountains and drop in.	O
So I am actually going to go little more darker.	O
OK, that works.	CHITCHAT
It works that works.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add in more sheets.	O
How are you guys?	CHITCHAT
Let's see if I can add.	O
A brighter one.	O
So mixing two colors.	O
Yeah, it's getting somewhere this is exactly what I wanted.	O
OK, next.	CHITCHAT
So we have group discrete right?	O
This group it is called create an.	O
I'm going to create all this.	O
Like a rope or cables.	O
To carry this we need cables, so for that we all just use this.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let's color pic from here.	O
Uh, maybe 1 pixel, not too thick, just.	O
Imagine there's something up here.	O
Ann And I'm doing this.	O
Right, as if it's carrying the things.	O
By just using ships.	O
I think this shapes can be a little darker, so I'll just move my.	O
Hello Diego, that works of art color.	O
Pick this.	O
And I'll just change the rest of the shape too.	O
This color 'cause it makes more sense to be slightly darker.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
They go.	CHITCHAT
She's carrying the boxes, right?	O
Cool next idea will be nice to have another quit, but maybe not the same shape.	O
So I'm going to call this cables.	O
And I also have another regular crate, but this is slightly rectangular.	O
Let's propes I think I opened the image resident importing it one more time.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Suppress W.	O
Select subject Perfect musket And, uh, make sure you flip it vertically.	O
And this has to go underneath here.	O
So it's raining right now, just too heavy, so that's why I thought that it.	O
And they go.	O
Let's move it up.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
OK, we have to do some color adjustment.	O
What do you guys think?	CHITCHAT
But it gets good.	CHITCHAT
Wow, we learned so much within an hour.	O
We fix the colors for this 2 characters, the hikers.	O
We added the.	O
Stairs.	O
We also did some blending onto the Ganesh's statue.	O
We added waterfall.	O
Now we add it.	O
I mean, we added helicopter.	O
Now we're heading to create.	O
Who will be done so many things within an hour?	O
OK, now we're going to.	O
Do some color adjustment.	O
For this.	O
So let's create a new layer keyuan situation.	O
Let's reduce the amount of lightness.	O
All this also white edges around it.	O
We going to fix that.	O
OK, in order to fix that we can go to filter other minimum.	O
Boom fixed.	CHITCHAT
So reduce the saturation as well.	O
Maybe not so contrast Bingo.	O
That works and let's reduce even a bit more.	O
So that's not so Brown or cake perfect, and I am going to.	O
Create a new layer of light, but this like is darker.	O
Let's reduce darkness, dump it in.	O
And see if that was, yeah, that was.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Ye getting somewhere.	O
OK, now for this.	CHITCHAT
I think because it's just too close.	O
Like for example this, even though I had it a bit, people kind of know that it's like a container here I need to add like a belt.	O

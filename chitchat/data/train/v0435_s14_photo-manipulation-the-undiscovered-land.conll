So for this, let's go back up here above.	O
The crate.	O
Let's use like this, but let's increase to three for the width.	O
OK, that works, so I'm going to adjust the color to slightly brighter.	O
Let's just test out the color works.	O
No, I want to sleep doctor.	O
So everybody good.	CHITCHAT
OK, from here I'd like to drag this.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
Like this?	CHITCHAT
And like that.	CHITCHAT
So imagine right.	O
So again, I'm doing the manual fixing here I'm imagining.	O
The belt to go here.	O
There an.	CHITCHAT
Underneath here.	O
Again, is all imagination.	O
So you can see how I wrecked it, right?	O
And let's do one more the site, but you don't have to do.	O
For this we will do masking.	O
Oh, I think we don't have to.	O
A bit maybe a bit.	O
OK, let's do mom asking here B.	O
Let's zoom in here.	O
And erase the line here.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
So you can see, right?	O
The container will Boo Boo.	O
But probably I want to do a bit of color adjustment to this one.	O
Because it's just too flat.	O
Let's lock this.	O
Uhm this one.	O
I'm going to make it slightly brighter.	O
Year and even this.	O
So that there's a bit of difference, right?	O
Tells everything looks the same This No.	O
There's no.	O
Color difference.	O
OK, and I'm planning to also make this one.	O
Slightly brighter.	O
So I hope you guys can see what I'm doing right now.	O
Right, I'm fixing the colors.	O
Of the belt.	O
So there's a bit of a difference.	O
Else everything looks the same tone.	O
If the light is coming from the top.	O
Left, it makes sense that the belts underneath to be darker but not the top ones.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
This is just this one.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And then it here I'm going to make this.	O
Docker.	O
No, that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Perfect yes.	CHITCHAT
Nice so you can see what's going on right now, right?	O
He You need to add more dramatic.	O
Stuff I think would be nice too.	O
Add in.	O
More dramatic stuff, for example.	O
Let me see if I can phone.	O
Yes I have.	O
Most of that actually.	O
So let me group here.	O
Let's call it cables.	O
That's perfect.	CHITCHAT
And a modern mix.	O
The dramatic stuff would be let me see if I have so to give the look of the helicopter blades spinning.	O
Motion blur can be used, just asking.	O
Uh, yeah you can.	O
As he depends how how you see it like for example, right?	O
This team is taken in depends on the camera that be great.	O
You can have that motion thing, but I don't want to put it for this one because I want the bullet to be seen.	O
You can add the motions if you want to.	O
But yeah, let me try that very quickly.	O
But before that before that I do have.	O
Some flock of birds to be edit.	O
Right, so that you give more dramatic field so and if you notice I want my words to be white in color, not black.	O
So we need to invert this color so in order to invert, just press CTRL I.	O
For invert and to blend it with the background, just go from the.	O
To screen.	O
There are you have.	O
They go.	CHITCHAT
Now you have the bird.	O
In what?	O
And?	CHITCHAT
Let's just reduce the size?	O
And place it.	O

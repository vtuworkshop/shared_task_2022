Let's see.	CHITCHAT
There.	CHITCHAT
He can also be here was too close to the helicopter.	O
Great, let's explicit here and let's reduce the amount of opposite E.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Right, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
I do have again I'm reusing assets that I've used from my previous room.	O
So like I said, we can always reduce reuse items.	O
So there's no harm in reducing stock images.	O
I released at.	O
And I'm going to place this.	O
Here.	O
So solution is saying if it's possible to give the rotating effect as spending effect, you can let me see if I can get that done right.	O
Perfect, let's have that group there.	O
Wow, OK, cool, I didn't even thought of placing it there by this looks perfect.	O
This is a bit balanced on.	O
We are ahead of our time.	O
I actually thought it would take around 2 hours to get this done, but I am going to fast, hopefully not.	O
Just want to thank my wife full.	O
Preparing nesca fees and stuff for me coffee.	O
I just need my my coffee in it.	O
Morning as I can work.	O
Perfect wow, so let's do the blending thing.	O
So the spinning effect that Shushan was saying, let's see if that can be done.	O
I am going to zoom in here.	O
Let's see right how it's done out.	O
what I can do is.	O
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Hum, I can actually draw.	O
Sick.	CHITCHAT
Blades for now don't worry.	O
There's a reason why I'm doing this.	O
I'm going to select.	O
Displayed.	O
I'm going to go to filter.	O
Blue Radial blur I'm going to spin it.	O
Let's see if that works.	O
Can you see?	CHITCHAT
It.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, that's how you do it, right?	O
Let me redo that one more time.	O
So here.	CHITCHAT
Just like.	CHITCHAT
So after you draw the lines the thick lines.	O
Selected go to filter blur radial blur you'll see zooms pin and everything so just look for spin, increase the amount and just click OK.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
That's the spinning effect.	O
I can even reuse this.	O
Let's call it spinning.	O
And duplicate that.	O
I can't even put it.	O
For that played on the plane over there.	O
That's right, the helicopter.	O
Right, and I can always adjust it.	O
Using the warp.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
In That's great, thank you see everything is possible with photo shop.	O
Everything is possible for the shop.	O
And I will just.	O
Erase this fight so that's not social.	O
Uh-huh Yeah, that looks like a real thing.	O
But yeah, as long as you guys like it do let me know if you unless anymore items that you guys want me to add, I can.	O
At first I was thinking it would be nice to add like 2 statues.	O
Right in front of the Lord Ganesha, but I couldn't find it last night an I don't mind spending some time finding it now actually.	O
Meanwhile, do you guys have any questions?	CHITCHAT
She'll be guys saying that trick is amazing.	CHITCHAT
I didn't expect it me too.	O
I mean, I, I kind of use radio blow before an I'm just using my mind to find out what is the best fit in a very fast pace.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So by just throwing out the lines and just turning it using radial blur that works.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to.	O
The hikers and call it light.	O
I don't think there's enough like onto this hiker, so I'm going to increase the lighting very quickly.	O

Let's choose B.	O
And.	O
I'm going to just.	O
And in lights.	O
To them, right?	O
As I feel they are.	O
They don't look.	O
Too obvious, so by doing this.	O
Then they will look.	O
More visible.	O
Lego, so let me do that before, not the right.	O
Can you see that the small little details makes a lot of difference?	O
And the bank as well.	O
Not so much, just be.	O
Danish saying if it's an alien I delicate or might be flashing the headlight towards lot condition in order to say that is if they encountered that you will be on doing this morning.	O
OK yeah you can.	O
That's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
And I was thinking it would be nice to have it on.	O
And a night mode, but in the lot of like scenes can be seen like if I change this to night mode.	O
Waterfall can be seen and then I can also add light thing if I want to like to the helicopter helicopter kind already have the lights.	O
So that works.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
What we can do is we can even.	O
Change the color slightly.	O
Let me see if I can blend one more color.	O
To see if it's going to look for America not again, I don't know.	O
Which ever that might work.	O
Such an easing high.	O
Hi Anna.	CHITCHAT
Hi such any money.	O
Well, this is a night mode.	O
Yeah, we can even do this.	O
We can even blend it.	O
Let's see if it works.	CHITCHAT
Lego is like getting occur again.	O
I don't know right?	CHITCHAT
If you want to add flashlights right?	O
What you can do is.	O
Here's a quick way to get it done.	O
Let me let me go right below the spinning.	O
Create a new layer called.	O
A light helicopter like right.	O
OK capture.	O
Helicopter light.	O
Ah, they go OK.	O
You can even do this.	O
Uhm, you can get the flares.	O
Uh, let me see if I can get it from my previous um streams.	O
I do have.	O
I can even use this.	O
Right, I can make it screen.	O
Reduce.	O
And at on here.	O
Right, so you can be in the summer here.	O
As well.	O
Perfect I can even.	CHITCHAT
Vicki duplicated.	O
And I can even place it.	O
Onto that Alec after I'm even, we can be seen, but it makes sense.	O
Sorry to have it as well.	O
They go something like that.	O
So you ask more of the realistic look to it, um?	O
Yeah, he's saying hi, how are you and I'm doing great.	O
How are you answer genius asking how but adding little grass over the statue like the grass.	O
Grown over the statue.	O
That's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can add that.	O
I just need to look for the right stock image, see if I can find it.	O
Hold on a second.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
It's like those.	O
Leaves right awhile leaves.	O
Let me see if I can find it.	O
To do that to do.	O
Up What do you call that that that?	O
Please um.	CHITCHAT
There's a name for it leaves.	O

I might have it somewhere in my computer.	O
I can find it.	O
I know what he's talking about.	O
I know what he's talking about.	O
Let me see if I can find it.	O
Very quickly is what I'm going to do I am going to look for the.	O

I actually can't remember the method.	O
And she had to be nice to change all this green leaves to Sally Pinkish.	O
Buy things with too much.	O
But you know, like how the infrared works.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
For this light I think would be nice to add.	O
More of like spotlight.	O
So what I'm going to do is I am going to create.	O
A fake.	O
Claire Just around here.	O
Like this?	O
Right, and I'm going to switch my color to black and white.	O
I need the gradient.	O
And then just.	O
Trump is just like this.	O
That's too much.	O
So what I'm going to do is I am going to blur it out.	O
Blue goes in love.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit too much, but.	O
Or in fact, I do have something.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
In my computer, hold on.	O
Let me check.	O
I do have something that I can.	O
Use that will be.	O
That would be this.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I have something.	O
Sure, rather than using this which might work as well, but I am going to.	O
I know I.	CHITCHAT
Yellow, you say, are you using obvious studio for life?	O
A streaming yes I am sure because saying that's the waterfall not reach till the ground.	O
Just a small dog.	O
Well it can.	O
But just that is being blocked by the middle part of the amount, and so it doesn't fall right underneath.	O
That's my.	O
Argument I just getting so I have this.	O
I'm going to blend it.	O
Using screen.	O
An so that's more.	O
This is actually a light.	O
From a studio, right?	O
That's taking an adult mode, but you can see how.	O
I'm utilizing it for this is for helicopter.	O
That's perfect, but you can see this like a bit of line here.	O
We're going to just that very quickly, right?	O
This line here.	O
An I am going to use levels for that.	O
OK, this is a spotlight.	O
Let's just make it to a smart object.	O
Let's use CTRL L to adjust the levels.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
It's perfect.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
OK, um yeah.	CHITCHAT
If you want me to adjust the waterfall to go underneath, I can show become let's try right click well or I need to make it a smart object so we can say OK I guess yeah because there's like a mountain in between so it hits the.	O
The middle part because you can see some sort of like a curve, so that's why I didn't even pull it down.	O
I mean, I can try let's try.	O
I mean, since you reset.	O
That are wrapping.	O
Thank you, pull it down.	O
But yeah, it's just.	O
It just doesn't look right, but yeah, but thanks for the suggestion.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Wow, we're getting somewhere.	CHITCHAT
What is this white line into the delicious ice?	O
Is bothering me.	O
Is it on statues not coming from the statue?	O
Where is this coming from?	O
God, it's partly OK.	O
Let's musket press B.	O
Change the soft brush.	O
I don't like this.	O
They go perfect.	CHITCHAT
I can even adjust the spotlight to be slightly more larger.	O
As in like longer.	O
This make this model object very quickly.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That might work, I think.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
No, it was just leave it.	O

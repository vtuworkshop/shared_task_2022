Cool.	CHITCHAT
And reduce the signal.	O
Dennis is exactly what I had in mind.	O
Those lights perfect.	O
OK I am trying to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to reduce the saturation a bit more.	O
The Green is just.	O
Too much.	O
Yeah, that works.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
At first, like I said earlier, I think would be nice to add more of the statues like around it, but I couldn't find the right composition.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, yeah, the night mode works.	O
But I think it's a little too.	O
Douglas is brought in it out of it.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
It works.	CHITCHAT
This is a perfect collaborations.	O
Do let me know is there something else you guys want to add?	O
I really, really like this collaboration.	CHITCHAT
You guys give me so much of ideas, so many ideas.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Cool um?	CHITCHAT
Let's fix the.	O
Let's call this crash, and now let's musket.	O
But I just.	O
Cleaning it up a bit.	O
She'll be God.	O
I just love the oral turn off disable it.	O
Thank you me too.	O
There are times where I don't know.	O
What about few bits?	O
Near the waterfall somewhere it fits we have we have already.	O
2.	CHITCHAT
Group of birds.	O
Right, I can even bring it there to the waterfall.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think that works.	CHITCHAT
Sure, sure.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that works.	CHITCHAT
Only good thing.	CHITCHAT
I really, really like this manipulation.	O
I didn't thought that you cannot be like that.	O
I mean, again, I gather all the stock images.	O
Yesterday I kind of know where to place it, but.	O
I didn't know that you cannot to be like this, so thank you to you guys.	O
You guys are like the other person under like the designer.	O
Cool, and let's see if I can add any more items in.	O
What can I add?	O
Let me look for some statues right like art.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm just going into my stock images to see if I can find any.	O
Lake Park They can I use.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Trying to find a suitable one.	O
'cause I don't be too dramatic.	O
Again, when you overdo things, then everything looks likely, so sometimes it's nice to have this minimalism.	O
You guys agreed.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there is it.	CHITCHAT
What if we put some rainy cloudy Sky?	O
Not so now.	O
Yeah, kinda doubt this is just enough.	O
No, but I think.	O
I know what you mean.	O
Maybe it's not.	O
The smoke is the cloud.	O
I think it will be nice to have.	O
Smoke instead, let me try that.	O
I actually do have something in my library.	O
All over.	O
Right in my library I do have.	O
Something that I can reuse if I'm not mistaken, summer here.	O
Yeah I do have.	O
The smoke.	O
Let's see if we can do something about it.	O
Right?	O
I would rather place it.	O
In front of the hikers.	O
And I would like to come.	O
Make it into a screen.	O
No, that doesn't work.	O
I'll just move this right on top.	O
So.	O
Above the light.	O
Let's see if this works.	O
I don't know, I'm just trying out.	O
Let's see if that works.	O
Not too much.	O
But I don't even two bright as well, just.	O
Let me try to reduce the lightness.	O

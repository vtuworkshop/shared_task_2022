'cause I don't interfere the other details.	O
Like if you if I.	O
Like cloudy stuff and everything right?	O
Then I can't see the helicopters detail.	O
I can't see the bird.	O
So yeah, maybe we just reduce.	O
The miss.	O
A bit not so much.	O
We have 19 people joining online.	CHITCHAT
Hello everybody.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, now my work.	CHITCHAT
At first I thought would be nice to also have.	O
A bit of like what you call, not Lipson said wow, this is dramatic.	O
Let me see if I can reduce this.	CHITCHAT
Oh is even buffering for me.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully everything is OK there.	CHITCHAT
Can you guys still watch what I'm doing 'cause it's streaming for me?	CHITCHAT
Which is not a good sign.	CHITCHAT
Perfect or you guys can still see project?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, what I did was I ended the lead Sunset Coluca.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I just don't know if it's going to work with.	O
It gives more like a realistic look to it.	O
Let me try one more time.	O
They go.	O
Even the Sky kind of like it when it's like a bit brownish.	O
Right, that makes sense because it's like a sunset feel to it.	O
But yeah, we're getting somewhere.	CHITCHAT
Those watching online we find this really useful.	CHITCHAT
Give me a thumbs up.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there's also another thing.	O
We can also add light to a certain parts of the manipulation, so in order to do that.	O
Just create a new layer called say light.	O
OK, let's increase the brushes to something really big and I'll show you how it's done right.	O
And I want you to color pick something from the artwork itself.	O
Let's say this one.	O
And what you can do is you can always.	O
Drop.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
Can you see?	CHITCHAT
Right when you do that, then there's the focus.	O
You can also do blending.	O
This is soft light.	O
See on enough.	O
Not sure if you guys can see, but yeah.	O
So this like a focus there in the middle.	O
Let's increase the flow.	O
Let me show that one more time.	O
AB.	CHITCHAT
And drop the color.	O
Can you guys see that?	O
So that it.	O
It's not flat.	O
So there's like a depth.	O
This like those guys.	O
The high price of the site and once I drop in the middle loudly saying very useful, always.	O
Linda love from your stream while thank you so much the.	O
Thank you so much now that I had in the drop.	O
Then they said glow in the middle an and that made the whole other looks real.	O
Always, always have this in mind whenever you do photo manipulation.	O
You have to imagine you're there then only you know how to create a realistic looking for communication.	O
Don't just create.	O
Just adding items for the sake of all this photo manipulation, the more I add, the more it makes sense.	O
So yeah, don't do that.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and also I supposed to upload my it is outward onto my Instagram.	O
I am doing that now while I'm talking to you guys.	O
So if you're on Instagram, you can go to my account.	O
To see my leaders artwork.	O
Yes, uh, I'm not sure thing.	O
Uh, nothing you show.	O
OK, sorry.	CHITCHAT
She says I'm not gonna show.	O
And give a quick rundown where.	O
We right click on the any layer blending option and interruption and either because you haven't mentioned the last room.	O
Can you show the right click on the?	O
Oh I didn't OK let me let me do that one more time, so you're saying?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Any layers running OK, like for example?	O

Hey everyone, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Welcome back to another live stream.	CHITCHAT
Um, making sure everything is.	CHITCHAT
Set up OK.	CHITCHAT
Awesome um, yeah, so you can see this is what I was working on last night.	CHITCHAT
Um, with the live stream and I have.	CHITCHAT
Decided over the course of last night today that.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to actually.	O
Take this piece and can turn it back on its head once again and.	O
Actually turn this into a mountain.	O
Like mountain landscape with wild Flowers growing.	O
Simple cry OK so.	O
Yeah so.	CHITCHAT
I was really liking where this is going.	O
Also was playing with.	O
A potential color palette for the background that's a little too bright, but somewhere in there.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I think I think there's a lot of fun stuff going on on here and I just want to change up the direction just a little bit and.	O
Yeah, so I'll stop talking and get things rolling.	CHITCHAT
OK so.	CHITCHAT
First thing that I do need to do that OK, uhm?	O
Pretty much need to.	O
Merge like all these.	O
Players.	O
Together Hum.	O
And then what I'm going to do after that is all duplicate them.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Take out the vase for this new idea that I have that one.	O
Play with and.	O
See so duplicate.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
And pick that one.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK um.	CHITCHAT
And I'm still.	CHITCHAT
I think I like this Navy better than.	O
I had black before.	O
If I have that saved in a separate layer, I don't think I do.	O
Oh, that's OK, um.	CHITCHAT
But OK, so yeah, I'm going to go ahead and.	O
Um, drop this on two and we're going to just go ahead and merge layers in the group.	O
And I'm going to start by.	O
Erase thing.	O
The Vase, 'cause Obviously there's no basis in.	O
The wild.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, so basically my idea with this is that I want to.	O
Have these like wild Flowers.	O
Coming up kind of just growing wild wildly for lack of better words.	O
So it was kind of interested in.	O
Maybe making it?	O
Bigger.	O
We'll see if that's.	O
Little bit too big.	O
Or if that works OK, uhm?	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Well, actually I guess here let me go back.	O
I'm going to duplicate this one more time again.	O
And just kind of play with the layout.	O
So basically yeah, like I had this idea of.	O
Having Just like a whole row of wild Flowers in the front and then it's going to.	O

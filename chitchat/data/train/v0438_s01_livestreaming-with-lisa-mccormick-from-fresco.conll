Go up into a mountain landscape.	O
See if I can just kind of.	O
Use these two.	O
As a fill for now.	O
So obviously a lot of that does still look more like a pattern and not like an organic shape, so I'll have to.	O
I'll have to change things up.	O
Hey Mom Get see you.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so this is just kind of on my sketching phase right now, um.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Understand.	CHITCHAT
And you know, I feel like this would be better shaped as a uhm.	O
Like a rectangle canvas, so I might even just kind of.	O
Which this shape.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
But I think it would be cool to have some type of like mountain landscape like so and then.	O
Potentially even do like a.	O
You know you've got like some type of like Glacier Lake.	O
And, uh, we definitely want to add in some animals.	O
Whether it's like a bear or deer or something, and then.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Do a cool son.	O
I guess it would be cool to as well to actually make this like a real place.	O
I felt that this kind of looks potentially like what does maroon bells?	O
I think kind of look similar to this.	O
Makeover reference photo.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK yeah, that potentially looks like it.	O
But you know it, scratch that.	O
I think I'm just going to run with it and do my own type A.	O
Made up Landscape so sometimes.	O
When I do try to go off of something that exists like I want to make sure everything is like technically correct and.	O
I think today I just want to have the freedom.	O
To just kind of make up.	O
Make up with.	O
This will look like and not necessarily worry about having it all perfect, so.	O
Yeah, OK.	CHITCHAT
And then the other thing that I'm thinking.	O
Before I get too far into this is.	O
I wonder what it could look like if.	O
Duplicate that overtime.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
If this did end up just being more of like A.	O
Like a long Canvas instead of a square like a rectangle.	O
There's the word rectangle.	O
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
For some reason for Macy's.	O
App settings.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
For some reason.	O

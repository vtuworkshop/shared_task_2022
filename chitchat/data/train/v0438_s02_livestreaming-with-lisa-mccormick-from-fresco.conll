OK, I think my snap to line.	O
Feature for some reason stuffed.	O
It's super weird.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can actually, I'm going to Google it.	CHITCHAT
It used to be a snap.	CHITCHAT
Total wine in Frisco.	CHITCHAT
That was like part of the experimental features.	O
And it feels like it.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
It seems like it just.	O
Somehow got Ray so.	O
Let me just quickly I'm looking up right now, Googling, making sure I can do this straight edge tool.	O
In Adobe fresco.	O
Sensitive.	O
OK, it says use a straight edge tool.	O
Sing artwork edge tool.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm sorry guys having some technical difficulties right now, um.	O
So OK, this is the straight edge tools.	O
Now that's transform.	O
It totally went away.	O
OK, it move the straight edge tool.	O
Something in the screen.	O
Ah, I found it.	CHITCHAT
It's down here that this bottom right to off there we go yay.	O
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
So I'm actually haven't used this yet.	O
I think this is a brand new feature.	O
Uh oh, don't want last so.	O
Nope, that is the wrong brush.	O
There we go yeah, OK.	O
That makes me super happy.	O
OK, so this is a new feature.	O
I'm actually pretty pumped too.	O
Try this out.	CHITCHAT
Adobe updated like all of their apps last week, I think.	O
Uhm, and there's a lot that I have.	O
To learn still and.	O
Yeah, I'm excited to.	CHITCHAT
I guess show you guys my process as I figure it out as well.	O
So hopefully you guys can bear with me as I as I'm learning, uhm.	O
OK, so I'm just kind of quickly blocking out.	O
These two sides, just to make sure I can.	O
Visualize this.	O
Thanks again.	CHITCHAT
Funny, I feel like I would do this in drawing classes like back in high school and college and um.	O
And I guess even post classes too, but um.	O
Like where you would use like masking tape to kind of like.	O
Shape your canvas, um, if you needed a different shape than just but the piece of paper was so.	O
Kind of that same concept of trying to figure out like what this could look like.	O
A Maza rectangle so OK, I think that's looking pretty good.	O
And I'm almost picturing this as Like A.	O
Like control like an art nouveau type of.	O
Poster.	O
You definitely want to make this detailed.	O
Make it really fun.	O
I think I want to add.	O
Some type of text to it.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I'm pulling up reference photos right now.	O
For myself, just to.	O

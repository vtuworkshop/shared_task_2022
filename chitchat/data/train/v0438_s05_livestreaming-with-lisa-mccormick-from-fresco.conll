And.	CHITCHAT
Go.	CHITCHAT
OK and then.	CHITCHAT
And come back to that idea with having.	O
Like Had several different I think Flowers lined up.	O
No, that's not it.	CHITCHAT
Over there something like that.	O
But you know, I think that's.	O
Those Flowers get so small and lost that.	O
Well, I think I want to do something a lot bigger.	O
So OK, I'll go back to this.	O
Feel like I could almost do something like.	O
That where I really, really.	O
Zoom in.	O
And have them coming out.	O
She's like that's pretty cool.	O
It's like a really low angle.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK, and uh.	CHITCHAT
Let me get back to you.	O
I want to make sure that.	O
The thickness for the.	O
Brush is all consistent.	O
Probably like a.	O
Summer in there.	O
And again, right now I'm still just this is all.	O
Supposed to just kind of be messy and I'm up.	O
Just exploring different potential ideas.	O
So please excuse my rough sketching.	O
Promise it'll be.	O
A lot more polished off.	O
Once this is all said and done.	O
An turned out.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I feel like this is starting to look pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Feels like a pretty good idea.	CHITCHAT
I am so picturing this as.	O
I would look better as like a rectangle, and if I could do some type of like lettering.	O
I said, but maybe I'll add it on later on another day when I can switch the canvas size, but I'm afraid that if I switch if I try to switch the canvas and it will kick me out of the live stream.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I don't wanna do that, um.	CHITCHAT
Yes, OK, so this is looking pretty good and then.	CHITCHAT
See what other.	O
Details I can add.	O
Z.	CHITCHAT
So I actually did something similar to for UM pad ago NIA, which was such a dream client.	O
I really love everything that they stand for and.	O
So they do in so unfortunately it was supposed to be part of like a window display for them for.	O
The month of April for earth month.	O

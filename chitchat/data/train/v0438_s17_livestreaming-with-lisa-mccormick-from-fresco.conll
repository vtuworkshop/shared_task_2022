Especially when I'm working for clients and making different pieces that need to be vectorized.	O
Sometimes when you go in and just image trace a drawing, you can kind of lose a lot of that.	O
That detail or that like hand drawn touch you know, like the.	O
But at least I found that the drawing can.	O
Get a little wonky uhm so.	CHITCHAT
It's really nice to be able to just draw with a vector brush straight from fresco and then.	O
I can go in illustrator and Photoshop and, um, edit it just as it is and I don't have to image reset or anything, so it's been really nice.	O
OK so there is.	CHITCHAT
That flower and then I do have.	O
These little ones which.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And now I have them kind of like facing the side right now.	O
Like a side view of them.	O
Hello Faye, how are you doing?	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, I hope I pronounce your name right.	CHITCHAT
Is it Fe or FI?	CHITCHAT
I apologize if I'm mispronouncing it.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, OK so.	CHITCHAT
Seeing what this could look like as.	O
More like a flat flower.	O
Yeah, so we have.	O
We have options here.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So now what I want to do is.	O
So I want to kind of look at just the layout a little bit more.	O
Instead of doing exactly what we had over there, I want to come.	O
I think spread it out a little bit better.	O
This possible?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK, so duplicate.	O
And another thing too is when I was drawing these yesterday, it was supposed to be coming out of a vase, so everything kind of ended up looking like.	O
You know it's coming from.	O
The like.	O
Center of the page rather than.	O
Being more like evenly laid out a cross.	O
Uh, a field, so this will definitely help with like the stems having more of like a natural.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
It's like coming out of like a natural direction rather than.	O
How they were.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Duplicate that.	O
And again, it's really nice working in layers when I can just Draw Something and then duplicate it and.	O
Use it almost is like like a stamp or something.	O
Which I feel like, especially when doing a piece that is more like.	O
It's kind of like a mix between.	O
Obviously it's an illustration, but I also want to feel.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like it has a sense of Design and be like really.	O
Thoughtful about the UM.	O
The layout in the space of everything, so um.	O
It's nice to use like.	O
These Flowers as like there, like in the most consistent shape and not just have them all really different from each other.	O
So I feel like that that just helps things feel.	O
A lot more like designed so to speak and like the layout is really clean.	O

But more than likely.	O
Has separate individual pieces.	O
Wondering wondering what this was the female loxodon character that.	O
I've spent a little bit too long on.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And I still have to fix the knee.	O
This knee areas been haunting me.	O
There's a lot of stuff going on here.	O
Uh, same.	CHITCHAT
I've been alright man.	CHITCHAT
It's been weird.	CHITCHAT
I know you know that.	CHITCHAT
But I've been OK.	CHITCHAT
I think everybody is kind of in that OK.	CHITCHAT
Well, not everybody but.	CHITCHAT
Being OK is is good.	CHITCHAT
For me, I count that count that as a win at this point.	O
But I mean I may actually get rid of that piece here, but I was looking at the.	O
Armor reference and.	O
Why do these shoulder pieces, especially the bigger they are, have leather padding under them?	O
Kind of built in?	O
And I thought that's what this is missing.	O
This would have felt like it was missing something.	O
To say that it's not just a.	O
Chunk of metal sitting on the shoulder, you know?	O
Some of the inner inner workings.	O
I guess if you will.	O
Thanks man, appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm trying to.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna try and push push it a little bit.	O
See where we can get with it.	O
Try to get some life into it.	O
I'm not going to get like super detailed with it, but.	O
Do you want to highlight?	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Put a little love into it I guess.	O
Oh, this sounds yeah, those those are definitely on my end.	O
The delay is.	O
Still amazes me a little bit, but I had my mic hot before I went live.	CHITCHAT
Which I knew it was hot.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why I, uh, what you heard was this which of course sounds like something else.	CHITCHAT
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
It does not sound like a traditional water bottle.	CHITCHAT
I guess their water bottles out there that sound like that.	CHITCHAT
I mean this one does.	CHITCHAT
But I get a lot of other things referenced when people hear it.	CHITCHAT
I would say right, rightfully so.	CHITCHAT
How does Michael this yeah?	CHITCHAT
That biz.	CHITCHAT
What are you up to today, Sam?	CHITCHAT
I know that you're usually.	CHITCHAT
Busy busy.	CHITCHAT
So you're either about to get into something or you just got finished with something.	O
Still gonna look ugly for a bit I think.	O
Till I get this figured out.	O

Select that color.	O
Then use that to give me that room light.	O
That's OK, I don't mind that.	CHITCHAT
Some kind of going to do the same here.	O
With this the rest of this helmet.	O
Men of digit again.	O
Trying not to select the wrong brush before I start painting.	O
It's always a key component.	O
To efficiency.	O
Could lock this layer too so that.	O
The the outside there is don't get painted and you don't want to paint it.	O
I can make that read as a slate.	O
Yeah, Fortunately it's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
I'll keep that for now.	CHITCHAT
But that just means I need to do it all the way around.	O
This trunk Oh yeah, let me unlock that.	O
Unlock it thank you.	O
And actually erase into it.	O
I don't know is it the.	O
I just used the chalk brush.	O
Chalk 2 is what I call it.	O
So you talked to a little bit of the old Mr Jacks Brush occasionally.	O
Then I have some various other Xosoft Softish round or brush.	O
And I've got some other ones that I don't really use a lot.	O
Use like 2 brushes.	O
But yeah, that that chart brushes a default brush.	O
Now I can't remember exactly where I grabbed it from.	O
But it wasn't anything special that I remember.	O
It might have been in dry media brushes or wet me brushes or something.	O
Is not the one I know.	O
The one you use that.	O
It kind of looks like I think you use it for your drawing.	O
I've seen that one.	O
I have an integrated that one at all.	O
Well, it's been awhile since I've installed from scratch, so it could be wrong about being a default.	O
I'm pretty sure this last.	O
This 2020 version.	O
Came with a couple of folders of brushes.	O
And it was in one of those I'd use it before I think it was, uh, maybe, uh.	O
And Aaron Griffin pack or one of these packs.	O
But I noticed that same if it's not the same brush, it's super close, like almost the exact same texture when you stamp it.	O

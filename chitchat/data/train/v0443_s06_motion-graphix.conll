Go give him some support on this first desktop live.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I will be more of the same so I don't need you guys here.	CHITCHAT
I am going to make it red, which is a little weird, but I think we could pull it off only because like it's going to fit with the rest of my branding.	O
So hopefully that's not a big deal, but we will see.	O
A lot of these have like a darker color.	O
This is black and I don't like the black of it.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I want to see if I can add like a split let go of the other guys have here.	O
Now when they all split it debates, put it, they split it with like a few bombs.	O
The bombs, yeah, let's try to split notes be bumps.	O
You focus on Photoshop and illustrator, but have been really enjoying Frisco and started doing a lot more of that.	O
I need to get over myself and my version 2.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Not being as comfortable in a program.	O
Like definitely having issues with not being as competent drawing on the iPad and therefore it is inhibiting me.	O
From streaming from Frisco lot, but I like to use fresco by myself and no one else is watching and I just gotta remember that 100.	O
The answers has such a great, welcoming, supportive community of being just like yeah, no, it's fine if you're not incredible at something, you can still do it.	O
I'm still working person product.	O
Try it secret man.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to spoil the Magic.	CHITCHAT
Or I don't know you hear about that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think this out.	CHITCHAT
Really appreciate.	CHITCHAT
Yeah of course.	CHITCHAT
Then like I said, I'm really excited that.	CHITCHAT
I'm really excited that you are getting set up and having more fun with it.	CHITCHAT
Also, thank you so much for the follow, I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Although I did not shut your name at one when that happens.	CHITCHAT
Not even.	CHITCHAT
Whoa.	CHITCHAT
Lots of phone calls.	CHITCHAT
It's weird I turned off my.	CHITCHAT
A block of Josh Denny.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, Josh.	CHITCHAT
I turned off the ability to block number that I don't know, but I'm trying to get taxes.	CHITCHAT
I'm working with the guy that's doing it and it's calling 800 number, but like it's just wild how quickly?	O
Switch over is to just like immediately.	O
Also, I can use.	O
This color can tie up.	O
Immediately just getting spam calls out the Wazoo again.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
You know, I guess.	CHITCHAT
That's why am I cut off part of the time.	O
It could be fun.	CHITCHAT
Well, you could help me with jumping into frescoes, importing an image to trace over verse, trying to feel creative and draw well in front of people.	O
Yeah, that's actually very true.	O
They just kind of having a.	O
Having a base to work off of.	O
By the way, is it in as or Inas?	O
Or maybe just ends, but you're asking if I'm using a mouse or pen.	O
I like to use the pen, but actually right now I am using everything in the form of a mouse.	O
I need to get my tablet set back up.	CHITCHAT
I had forgotten a power cord for it and I got to route around and actually find one so.	CHITCHAT
All is well.	CHITCHAT
Let's just suffer first part of week.	O
Actually, I should just add a stroke.	O
Just the outside here.	O
Set it to four.	O
Oh, it's already the color that I want, which is splendid.	O
I want this to have a little bit more to it.	O
Now we brains work.	O
Do they all need to go in the same direction or can it?	O

Alright, Here we go.	CHITCHAT
We're going to lock this so that I can select this dude.	O
I say a membrane, but we're going to get rid of the legs, the arms, because those are going to be rubber hose.	O
And I need to bring over brain appendages.	O
I don't think I'm going to make the I blank.	O
I might make the eyes.	O
Might make the eyes rotate though.	O
So maybe.	CHITCHAT
Lia Edwards thank you so much for following the work here on behalf.	CHITCHAT
It's good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate your support.	CHITCHAT
Not the whole thing.	CHITCHAT
The whole thing, all of it.	O
So this is left eye.	O
And this is going to be right I.	O
Oh man, it's nothing Ryan making me happy you liked my idea.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, for the beautiful frickin title is good.	CHITCHAT
Leah is in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Could have any here?	CHITCHAT
OK, so we got the brain.	O
We got the brain appendages and then we got the brain eyes.	O
I guess I could do brain mouth as its own thing and we could make him like discern.	O
Brain mouth Weirdest title names are going to animate the brain popping out of the head.	O
Yes, I am Miss Goblin.	O
So it's going to start with.	O
We can put all this together actually is going to start with it together and him popping up and then the brain will pop out and then start directing.	O
Give some art direction why you not pasting you cut there.	O
I know you're there.	O
Pro X Control V.	O
Edit.	O
Purchasing a common windows problem.	O
I feel like it happens all the time.	O
We're like I very clearly.	O
And very clearly.	O
Copied it, I cut it actually.	O
But for whatever reason it won't paste it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Excuse me, is Doctor Goblin, just kidding.	O
I don't even say well yeah it is Doctor Garland.	O
I won't.	CHITCHAT
I won't refer otherwise.	O
He said just giving, but guess what he's there now.	O
This I wanted to say drawing hand for this.	O
I don't really think I need to put it on the rubber hose.	O
Who knows, though.	O
We're going to say human body for the.	O
Is there anything on the player?	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Human body.	O
This is just the background.	O
Hey Richard, what's going on and also welcome back in as budgets will be around.	O
You didn't believe me but here we are.	O
It's good to have you here.	O
I'm just working on separating all the files that we made so that we can come in and animate accordingly.	O
I'm going to put some layer.	O
We're going to probably just redo it once we are in after effects, but.	O
What can you do?	O
Um, let's see what else we haven't got.	O
What is this with brain appendages where I left side brain, mouth, brains, title?	O
OK, so this is going to be.	O
Death.	O
He just did it again.	O
Edit.	O
And it.	CHITCHAT

See, but now it won't let me like it's wild, you just you're the one that just.	O
It's.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
I know.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I'm going to save 'cause there is so much.	O
Well the circles be moving.	O
Yes, they're going to be going to be my lava style.	O
So I'm going to actually just put them all on one layer and then we're going to.	O
Caught lava and will probably recreate it once we're in.	O
Their desk lava top head.	O
Face noggin.	O
Draw hands human body cool, it's everything.	O
Now we can save.	O
Now we begin.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
After effects.	O
Open up here quick access hopefully will be there drawn from memory assets pop, it in and say how do you want to implement this and I'll say I want to get a composition footage dimensions you can do layer size for document saws now layer size is going to do the bounding box to be only around the layer that you're importing document sizes.	O
If everything is going to be in the same spot and you want it to have this anchor points in the centre of the compositional layer to be as if there's a huge transparent box that fills the entire area.	O
So I always do layer size when I'm doing the composition.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We began.	CHITCHAT
So as with everything.	CHITCHAT
Because I'm going to be streaming, it's important to know that it starts with absolutely nothing on screen.	O
So if I wanted to get somewhere.	O
I need to start off like so that way, except we're going to buy savings so that if it crashes.	O
Not totally.	O
Bruins But I need to go into.	O
I need to go into.	O
Google Drive.	O
And then began streaming.	O
Gone for memory.	CHITCHAT
Say.	CHITCHAT
What do we call it?	O
Memory serves me well.	CHITCHAT
Memory serves me well.	CHITCHAT
Asphalt memory.	O
It's also funny that I couldn't remember the name of it when it's all about remembering things.	CHITCHAT
A magic moment.	O
It's getting magnificent.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
The brain is leaving the head.	O
Where is it going to do?	CHITCHAT
It is going to be directing the things that.	O
The Dude is drawing so he'll start off with.	O
His human body and was going to pop up.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I guess we'll start it off by having the Red Maybe.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The right of the desk appearing and will do that by having some sort of like liquidy.	O
Downfall of it.	O
So I'm going to make a new shape layer.	O
I didn't need to be read right now just because we're referencing what were editing.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I want to start it up here.	O
I'm going to make a liquidy kind of vibe here.	O
I'm going to make it longer than the composition because I'm going to make it move to the side.	O
The similar.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Animation for something else.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Right, so now we have that were in your position.	O
I don't want to be too long, so we're going to zoom in.	O
We're going to do it like half a second long.	O
Fernando, what's going on?	O
I'm working on a a welcome back.	O
I'm working on a intro for a section.	O
If memory serves me well that is all about drawing things from memory that the audience and our community is going to suggest in the discord.	O

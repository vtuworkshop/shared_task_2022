It would be the same thing with the drawing and making sure that I changed the anchor point of it though first.	O
We should probably do the same, actually.	O
With this attached to the neck.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then we give me body and the draw hands take the face or else the noggin top head goes with the noggin.	O
Both need to be extended over here folks out of books.	O
So on top of Nagan position here.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Make sure that it is right location.	O
That I'm gonna have that pop up in a second so.	O
And for me to make this farther off to decide now that we have so much information.	O
Or just like even have it start sooner.	O
There is none of these are visible.	O
It will just kind of appear.	O
How about putting a rotation on the body?	O
No no oh Oh yeah, no version of the body is a good idea.	O
Yeah, it's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I'm gonna go.	CHITCHAT
And dumb.	CHITCHAT
Really good idea.	CHITCHAT
So let's do position.	O
And then maybe add rotation.	O
With that, click this.	O
Now we could do like a rotation of like maybe like here.	O
It's kind of fun, right?	O
Might be too dramatic.	O
It might be too slow also.	O
I enjoy that.	CHITCHAT
Also adding the same thing for the draw of the hand.	O
Adding a rotation to that, because then you can lift it up.	O
So like here the way blowers and.	O
That's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much and S.	CHITCHAT
This is too slow.	O
And also, should I just have this fly off the screen?	O
I could also do that.	O
Kind of like that.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Back in his place right there.	O
Get up.	CHITCHAT
Is the memory drawing part of nothing suspicious or is it separate?	O
It is part of Ryan selfie streaming.	O
So I have been trying to divide the two more clearly in the discord, so you'll see that there's stuff that is unique to the stream at the Port Challenge I think is on the porch at nothing suspicious, but it's been mostly here, but defender Ryan Silvey portrait challenging links and trump, so I'm only doing this on this one.	O
I don't want to do up rock.	O
We mourn.	O
Not like that.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
Then we'll go in, will copy and paste this.	O

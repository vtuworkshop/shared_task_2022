I have to.	CHITCHAT
I have to understand how this works.	O
Because it's it's.	CHITCHAT
It's going on top of it so I don't understand.	O
I need to find someone who knows more about that thing anyway.	O
LMAO, thanks for sticking by.	CHITCHAT
Uh Oh no, Sheridan said not now.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to head out now.	CHITCHAT
It's been an awesome stream so far.	CHITCHAT
Could work today.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, thank you you simulator tonight, right?	CHITCHAT
Make sure you you advertise your own string will pretty head out.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for stopping by as always.	CHITCHAT
Here is here.	CHITCHAT
This brain mad isn't working.	O
Maybe the anchor point of it's a contribution.	O
Let's try that let's change the anchor point and see if it's a design thing I don't know why it would, but	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I don't fully understand it, so we'll have to go about this little differently.	O
Something in the world it should be fine.	O
When is this pop up?	O
Fish and rotation.	O
Hi Sarah, Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
You're not coming in at all and you're here whenever is best for you.	CHITCHAT
I wanna make sure you check out Sarah's work.	CHITCHAT
She says my stuff so cute, but it's nothing in comparison to the stuff that she makes.	CHITCHAT
She's got great vectors and like $5 and Vibes and feta cheese.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, make sure you check yourself out.	CHITCHAT
Right now we're working on a new segment going on the stream which is going to be called a memory serves me well and it's going to be off of the discord.	O
People are and chat.	CHITCHAT
People are going to suggest different things.	CHITCHAT
For me to draw and then I'm going to drawl them without looking at any reference so.	CHITCHAT
Remove the health.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Sure.	CHITCHAT
Animate all this few seconds later because it's already moving, and then we're going to move everything over and then pick one thing.	O
So it's going to be a little weird.	O
But I assume it with the mouth and the eyes and think with them to the brain.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And essentially, we're going to turn out like this.	O
What kind of like it, like Gueye, kinda like that too rather than that, but.	O
Well, I'm flat like this or her.	O
I mean if he knows this spring.	O
And then.	O
16 here kind of.	O
Where it will begin.	O
My Hindu scale would be a little weird is the changes, but.	O
Oh, I'm going to go in and you can see that there's a path.	O
Where it's going to move and you can adjust it accordingly, which is nice.	O
Kind of like the idea of it.	O
See if I can make this work so as easy ease if at all.	O
In all honesty, the the legs don't really even need to be rubber hose 'cause they're not even going to be fully visible at any point.	O

We just made them illustrator now are popping over here, but it's a.	O
Uh, creation for a new segment that I want to do where I draw something from memory based off of suggestions in the chat in discord.	O
Getting it.	CHITCHAT
Let me call this memory serves me well and then these little dots over here these like lava parts are going to all be animated so you can ignore this for now.	O
But it's only got so far so.	O

Also, that is insane and I don't want that to be what that was this wild.	CHITCHAT
Why would I ever want to stroke that big for something so tiny?	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Let's take it.	CHITCHAT
Also add a little thumb, right?	O
Maybe I'll go off of this side.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I imagine knowing different languages is similar to like.	O
How I had to think about.	O
Which key commands to use and which program of after effects or illustrator?	O
Just because, like you know it, but you have to like give it a second to figure it out.	O
Imagine that's what it's like.	O
We need to switch through different languages in your head, but I want to know 'cause I am not bilingual 'cause I'm a loser from America.	CHITCHAT
Everyone today.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I'm doing well.	CHITCHAT
Cases for me, it's so nice to have clear representation in the game of the main character buying new garden of the game it would be so sad and intense.	O
Yeah, no that's what I had read about it.	O
That's 1 of the things I've read about it is so that it was like a national UN.	O
Unneeded.	CHITCHAT

Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Aren't for following.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
And so I didn't know how much validity.	O
There was that I just saw it, but you know how those circles were like people that follow people have similar opinions.	O
So obviously if someone says something everyone's going to jump on it as well.	O
But You know, as curious as to how that was.	O
'cause I was a lost the first one and I also love the little prequel they had with Eli as a kid with her first girlfriend, but it was really good.	O

He was talking about like they fixed it but they fixed it by going back to the thing that was a problem before it.	CHITCHAT
So it's like why even.	CHITCHAT
You're you're being dumb about it, so he was posting stuff on online.	CHITCHAT
Get into fights with 'cause he's originally from Georgia.	CHITCHAT
My roommate lives with me obviously in New York and he's going to arguments with people from Georgia who were like no, it's, you know, it's just rude and it's like, no, it's racist.	CHITCHAT
I know My Internet keeps going in and out.	CHITCHAT

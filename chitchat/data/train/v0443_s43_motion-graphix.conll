Uh.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Attached is the here.	CHITCHAT
Anne, I want to make this shape layer called.	O
Left hand, even though this is right, but you know it's going on an I want to attach it to the left arm rests like this.	O
Also, going to make it only pop up once.	O
These switches from this.	O

All people watching Netflix here in small town, Texas.	CHITCHAT
I never ask you if you're close at all to San Antonio.	CHITCHAT
Are you close to Diane?	CHITCHAT
Wherever Diana is now, the anticipated Texas?	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you knew that or not.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, senselessly.	CHITCHAT

Refined Y your anger points all the way over here.	O
I will never know.	CHITCHAT
On this to go to the right wrist, called those right hands.	O
The writers like that.	O
We'll see if we need to get rid of it at an earlier point.	O
Nope.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go ahead and we're going to actually duplicate this, and we're going to say left hand part one.	O
And rather than connecting it to that arm, we're going to actually connect it to this ability.	O
Bad boy.	O
And yes, I use all these terms while you guys are not here as well.	O
And I talk out loud just like this.	O
This is good to left arm wrist.	O
But as soon as this pops in, this needs to go away.	O

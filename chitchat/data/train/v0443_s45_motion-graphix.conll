So we have the right eye.	O
The left side brain's mouth, the brain, and like if you take any of these things and you pull him around, you can see that they all kind of all go together.	O
So that way we hopped over to.	O
After effects we then have all of these layers that have the same groupings and then I'm able to kind of move them around.	O
We have different parents that make things move something else moves were also using rubber hose for things like the line.	O
But I'm excited to see you guys already here.	CHITCHAT
It's great to see you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for sharing Maine with your class.	CHITCHAT
John oh that's awesome and hello to Claudio Eduardo.	CHITCHAT
It's great to see you.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I guess we just look at this real quick from the top of how it's going to look like the black right here represents whatever is going to be underneath the stream at the time and then it will have this play.	O
And then we'll have this little guy go.	O
There is a little yellow thing visible here.	O
But that won't be visible in the final.	O
That's just to help me kind of help rig what's going on with the wrist in the shoulder and keep an idea that.	O
I'm realizing he doesn't have anything to write on, so we should create a piece of paper.	O
I don't think I'm going to need to be specific so much to have anything appear on it 'cause I could make it kind of appear from the side.	O
So maybe I'll actually just make it a stroke rather than a shape.	O
Increase if you guys have any questions as I go over anything.	CHITCHAT
Please do not hesitate through.	CHITCHAT
Reach out and ask.	CHITCHAT
I just kind of work along and then kind of continue the conversation.	CHITCHAT
We do have a question for you regarding how responsive, responsive responsibility factors into process.	O
Can you briefly explain how you consider output for web use?	O
Oh OK cool cool cool cool cool.	CHITCHAT
So I actually have an extra plugin that I have for.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
For Encoding, because I don't.	O
Get bogged down too much with the idea of after.	O
Get Adobe media encoder, so actually have one called after Codex and it helps me just able to format into a movie or MP4 into H6HD6 format.	O
That being said, with things like this I actually still just keep the format and Avi because I want to have the Alpha channels and so I am fortunate enough to have a strong computer that can support that.	O
But because it has the Alpha channels and it has all of the data on it that files do end up.	O
Being a lot larger than usual, I personally haven't had a place to really find ways to bring that down.	O
You can go into a format options and you can adjust different codecs, but a lot of times with Codex sometimes they don't support Papa channels, but you can also mess with basic video quality settings to bring it down.	O
But normally if I'm just bring something up to web or something else, I love to use after Codex, I think it's only like I mean just students annoying 'cause it's hard to justify this cost, but.	O
I'll put the link to it in the chat for you guys.	O
It's available on a E scripts, another having sales throughout the summer.	O
Who is $89.00 more expensive than I thought it was.	O
But if you guys have I gotta ability to have like a grant or anything like that.	O
This is a really really great piece of software.	CHITCHAT
It works for both after effects in premiere.	O
And you can get a single user license or floating server license.	O
Versions of the areas I've already bought it, but.	O
Oh wait.	CHITCHAT
Because I had to use to click it OK, I'm going to say maybe they made it free, but they did I know they have sales throughout the year.	O
Yeah, for the most part, that's kind of where I work at, and then if anything goes beyond that though, I will say that I kind of.	O
Laying on the developers to kind of help me find a way to bring down those file sizes.	O
'cause I don't really have anything export to SVG or anything at the moment.	O
Is there an opportunity to work in SVG?	O
I personally have not had that experience yet?	O
I'm sure there probably is I would be surprised if there is not, but none of the stuff that I had to create an export yet has been an SVG so I wish I had a better answer for you.	O

But that is what I have for the time being.	O
Go ahead here, I go and I'm also I have a few cool plugins.	O
One that I would really suggest that anybody is trying to get into motion graphics would be motion 3, it's by I believe battleaxe.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe it's not, maybe somebody else.	CHITCHAT
Sprout By Mount Mograph.	O
Here you go.	CHITCHAT
And this is a one time license, so this one 65 which is cheaper than the other one.	O
But this one actually does more if you have to pick failed.	O
Definitely do this one.	CHITCHAT
This one has a lifetime license, but it helps you with different curves to address easy ease or hard transfers.	O
And then it has a series of different like.	O
Quick editing tools on top of it like this helps you move your anchor point without adjusting kind of where it is sitting in space.	O
You know your colors.	O
This is a good chart of how your motion is working and has a way you can scrub the composition and then also it has a bunch of tools for you to use to like break apart text or orbit, something you can add delays to between keyframes and also, if you hover over.	O
Any of these things it will pop up so this will delay system of duplicate layers, which is cool to do an echo of like thanks if you want to have all go and then have it behind it, and this is just one time, like this is like saying like they also have a bunch of these presets.	O
These are all the different ends and outs of easy so it's so it's really cool.	O
Images thank you, I'd rather they went out and learn more for themselves anyway.	O
Gosh, Well, you know I'll take it.	CHITCHAT
But that's where video formats only, not SVG.	O
If I can sign me in the only way I've been able to get video files down to size is by using some compression software like handbrake.	O
Yes, I've also done handbrake.	O
But Leon if you if you can you should definitely look into getting after Codex is awesome, Sarah also said handbrake is great hamburgs also free?	O
So definitely check that out, but Sarah says for SVG, maybe check out body movement and Lottie who I have not.	O
I have to check that out.	O
AE scripts body movin boom coming in clutch with the links here.	O
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
So this helps you just bring to export lobby.	O
Animations animations really default as JSNO files that you zloty JS player that comes along with a plug-in oh cool.	O
So then you can just bring it right into SVG canvas and HTML oh that's awesome so.	O
It's interesting that it shows you kind of hear how they have different breakdowns of.	O
Hum how it codes it out.	O
I just want to see the little.	CHITCHAT
I wanna see the little comparison I saw in the thumbnail.	O
Can I see the thumbnail?	O
Oh wow.	CHITCHAT
That's wild.	CHITCHAT
So as long as you can also make every sponsor stuff goose era, I need you to teach me some of this stuff.	O
Teach me how to be all Cody.	CHITCHAT
Have a great if you guys are not familiar.	CHITCHAT
By the way, Sarah and Leon are also too wonderful streamers on behalf that work with motion, graphic design, illustration.	CHITCHAT
It.	CHITCHAT
This song is wild.	CHITCHAT
I like it but it is not what I was expecting it today.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Nice.	CHITCHAT
And back to this he got that pops out when I still need to do.	O
Also, how does that?	CHITCHAT
I'll see that works great.	CHITCHAT
You'll see that about to use the motion right now because I want to have it kind of.	O
He's a little bit more so I use this guy and more.	O
All right now that dude.	O
Working with little snap to it, these snaps always fun.	O
Yeah, so you can see as I click it it'll change this small little white line.	O
I'll try to blow it up so you can see it better.	O
This small little white line that I'm using for the piece paper as I change these different there are changing the is kind of like even he's out and then also like the the fall off of it.	O
Think like that.	CHITCHAT
See how that is the same to keyframe same direction, but it's adjusting how the curves work between two keyframes in the handy dandy graph editor, which is confusing and a whole another thing that I love to not have to hop into it.	O

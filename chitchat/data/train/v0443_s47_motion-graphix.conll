Not too, but you can do things with values and speed.	O
And you going to adjust it, and it's kind of like how the velocity goes while you're working with it, and so those presets just healthy so you don't have to offer to this area as much.	O
'cause it's a little bit finicky.	O
I'm trash at motion.	O
I know enough to pass the 5050 tests, don't we all man?	O
This is let's get Cody, I know right?	CHITCHAT
I wanna get.	CHITCHAT
So scary, but it would be so useful.	CHITCHAT
Would be such a good Swiss Army knife of thing like Oh yeah, I can code that whatever.	CHITCHAT
Correct?	CHITCHAT
All right, so the last thing we need to do is I just want to go ahead and put in this lava.	O
One cool thing you can do is you can right click and you can do create shapes from layers and then it'll recreate everything.	O
That being said, I don't want it to all be on the same folder, the same layer, so I am actually just going to use this as inspiration breakdown.	O
The Opacity and then I'm don't want it all to be on.	O
The same can't because I think it's too busy and it's going to be too many things, so I'll actually go to this or duplicated just that.	O
I have the same area of it and then delete everything besides the background and the lava phone.	O
So now we just have this area and it's going to keep frame this puppy out.	O
There's a few cool things that I'm going to do.	O
Once we kind of get these all in place and that will be like using the wave.	O
Wave warp and.	O
Displacement Maps to kind of get them live your feel.	O
But first I just kind of want to.	O
Copy them.	O
There's also pleaded industry by the way.	O
So and all that replay is going to be available on my profile if you need it.	O
If you want to check it out, it will be just as long as we cut down.	O
I'm going to work on coming stuff down in the future, but right now it is.	O
Just a full replay.	O
Are you guys going classroom together?	CHITCHAT
Are you guys still in classes or you guys doing virtual classes?	CHITCHAT
By the way.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Also, if any of you guys are interested in live streaming.	CHITCHAT
Do.	CHITCHAT
Holy welcome students.	CHITCHAT
And experimenting, kind of what the new platform is, and we're launching being an streaming and coming here, but I can give you early access, so just reach out to me.	CHITCHAT
Let me know what you're interested in.	CHITCHAT
And we'll go from there.	CHITCHAT
You don't have to have a fancy setup or crazy transitions or any of that.	CHITCHAT
These are all things that I just like to do because.	CHITCHAT
Motion.	CHITCHAT
It's fun to have something to work on while I stream that, then I'll ever get to implement into my stream, but it's also just that I find joy in creating these things so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
This is personal preference.	CHITCHAT
There's plenty people that just have, you know a screen share and that's it.	CHITCHAT
So just let me know.	CHITCHAT
All right, uhm, now can get rid of it.	CHITCHAT
We have our area.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start I don't know why the background disappears at, oh, because it's a dupe of the other one.	O
OK, I understand.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And also you'll see that that is will never go away for you.	O
We will forever always be like wait, what was it doing?	O
Where was that thing?	CHITCHAT
Why is this doing this thing?	CHITCHAT
I can't stand it.	CHITCHAT
I want it like this right is gonna be an issue is it rolls over the type.	O
But I could be wrong.	O
Process for these all on the same.	O
I like the idea of them not being all the same speed though.	O
That's why I like to have them on different layers.	O
Nothing said since they are very similar and can.	O

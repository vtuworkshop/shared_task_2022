You know, hey, let's you know, let's pick something from my favorite movie then that kind of overrides that Nick, feeling where you may not exactly want to draw today.	CHITCHAT
And you know that's kind of in a way, that's how my whole daily painting things started was I picked a topic which was Halloween in the fall and also coupled that with the October, which is just drawing one drawing a day Inc.	CHITCHAT
Based so traditional.	CHITCHAT
And you know, making that commitment to improve and learn an try an.	CHITCHAT
I've tried it, you know, years previous, never never stuck it through but this time kind of.	CHITCHAT
I think the perfect storm happened with that subject matter and.	CHITCHAT
It's really kept me drawing, so when November 1st came around I was like why the heck should I stop.	CHITCHAT
Let's just keep going and that's a single thing that I would say helped me improve the most is just that commitment to practice and repetition and keeping that schedule.	O
So what I do when I do a scene study?	CHITCHAT
I'm not really.	CHITCHAT
Copying the scene directly, I've taken a couple of screencaps Here, Uhm.	O
Adjust his show as I kind of look at this scene as a whole.	O
I look at what happened slightly before slightly after an then right at the point where I'm looking to really study so the dynamic in this scene is the hatching scene.	O
Let's get a color that you can actually see.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is the hatching scene in Jurassic Park.	O
The first one.	O
And there's a very interesting dynamic in this scene.	O
It starts out here or everybody is focused on this miracle of life.	O
These these Dinosaur eggs, something that just never anybody nobody thought could ever happen again.	O
It's happening right now, and so it's just a miracle of life that everybody's focused on.	O
I also want to point out that John Hammond is in white and Ian is in black and they kind of that is kind of a visual representation of the characters foil for each other.	O
Ian represents kind of logic and.	O
Hammond represents passion I guess, but I don't know if that's the right way to it is passion, but it's more not passion.	O
It's kind of just like the heart, you know the.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't want to say imagination either, but it's kind of.	O
It's a more.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how to.	CHITCHAT
I would just I'll just call it for now passion.	O
And you'll see this playoff each other, then they'll see them playoff each other throughout the entire movie as opposites.	O
It's really interesting if you actually hone in on that and pay attention to it, and you can see it here in this scene very clearly moments after this transition right here.	O
So right now, the camera is kind of hanging in and out, back and forth.	O
You're really paying attention to this velociraptor hatching, and then we have the the.	O
Dinos hatched and the scene starts to change.	O
I never notice that.	O
Just yeah, no it is when she sees it home.	O
My gosh, I could talk about movies forever, but once you start noticing that stuff, you really see it and you're just like whole I'm I'm I'm a movie geek so I mean yeah.	O
But Alright, so this scene is where it changes and it really kind of the entire well.	O
One of the themes of the movie, at least in my mind, comes out right here and it ends up at the scene, very famous, where Ian says life signs away.	O
And what happens if you if you go and watch this scene on YouTube they just have it right here and I've taken the screencaps Here.	O
It's about 3 minutes long I think.	O
But this is where the dynamic starts to change in the focus leaves.	O
This miracle of life, and if you're watching this scene, you see Ian, he's kind of walking around the edges of this, and then he starts talking and you can also notice that everybody is not still focused on this anymore.	O
Lawyer is Hammond is.	O
She's focused on Ian and what he's saying.	O

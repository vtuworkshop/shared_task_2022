He's still focused down here.	O
But within seconds, everybody is focused on him.	O
He walks over here.	O
The doctor follows him and the scene switches.	O
The camera follows this doctor Ann there over here talking and he does.	O
You know he's are you saying the herd of female.	O
Dinosaurs were spontaneously breed and he's like, well, life finds away and then the camera cuts back to everybody else.	O
The Dinos are totally ignored and everybody's looking at Ian and it's white versus black.	O
It's passion and Imagination Anne.	O
Kind of had still not trying.	O
I'm still not getting the right word, but versus logic and that's what he is.	O
And that's what Hammond is new really?	O
See that right there.	CHITCHAT
You see you know, gosh, possibility of Dinos coming to life.	O
Let's do it.	CHITCHAT
And then you have a little logic coming in here at the end and saying how wait wait a minute these guys were selected for extinction.	O
You know nature nature basically said your time is done.	O
Anne were messing with Mother Nature or messing with the natural way of things and you know, they don't like that and that's why you know everybody in that scene.	O
Let me just actually get it.	O
'cause it's really kind of funny to see how this dynamic has changed so completely.	O
So here is.	CHITCHAT
Alright seconds away from here we pulled away from the group.	O
And this is another interesting dynamic as well.	O
The camera is very, very deliberately positioned behind the doctor over the shoulder, IANS, very small, so he's kind of.	O
Is kind of like a David and Goliath type moment right here, but then.	O
All right, and then, here's the very next scene, so this is something also that I like to do is I like to.	O
Script out, I like to follow the script of the story and just look at how differently proceeding from one scene to the next, how these kind of captured moments start telling this story and so all of sudden the only one focused on the baby dinosaurs, Hammond and everybody else is there like wait a minute.	O
What are you saying?	CHITCHAT
And then all the sudden the camera is focused only on him with a very slow pull in so that he gets bigger and bigger and bigger and his ideas and he his opinions are getting bigger and more heard by the group.	O
So you can see this here.	O
He starts out very small and it's a slow pan in and then all of a sudden he makes his statement.	O
And we have another David and Goliath moment.	O
Right here, but the scene is completely reversed.	O
We have logic.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's I didn't get the right one.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Come on.	CHITCHAT
Let me copy and paste here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I should have grabbed all of these to start, but she here we go again the same scene 1 two mirrored but the circumstances are completely opposite.	O
We've got the David and Goliath moment reversed where logic is now over, powering the passion of the moment and the excitement of discovery and something new.	O
And you know, when I do a scene study, I think it really helps, especially if you're looking to.	O
Up your game and how your illustrations tell a story because that story doesn't just exist for the moment of your illustration.	O
There's lead up an.	O
There's an exit to that moment that you that you're that you're drawing here now my moment.	O
In this case, is going to be this right here.	O
But you know to have this knowledge of the scene and how it changes in the dynamic of the you know the story being told he ran the point they're trying to make in this three minute interval.	O
It's really powerful once you kind of sit down and start looking at it and really back away from being immersed in the movie.	O
And you know sometimes that can't happen until you watched it.	O
You know three or four times where you're over the excitement of the new Anne.	O
You know, like something like but actually.	O
I can take an example where the power of those visuals completely took me out of the movie and that was the last Jedi.	O

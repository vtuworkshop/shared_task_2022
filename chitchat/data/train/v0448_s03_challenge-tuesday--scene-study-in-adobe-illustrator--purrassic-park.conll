Uhm, I just I was completely divorced from the story.	CHITCHAT
I didn't care.	CHITCHAT
I was just looking at these visuals because they were so strong they were distracting, almost appointed.	O
Actually, it was to a point of distraction.	O
It took me out of the movie an so I mean.	O
I think a good story.	O
Has invisible ink like this.	O
The invisible ink is not so visible that it takes you out of the story, informs you without informing you an you know it seems like this that you can watch him look at and examine.	O
You can see Spielberg is of course.	O
Incredible at it, but you can also look at you know how color is used in different movies and you know, like you can look at color scripting.	O
A lot of the Pixar Art books include color scripts at the front and you can see just through color how the story progress.	O
You can see how it starts out, you know?	O
Maybe in warm colors, happy colors, very very comforting colors.	O
And then you know when there's moments of tension and moments of.	O
You know, change those those.	O
Those colors will contrast more.	O
You'll get more colors like Reds.	O
You'll get danger, colors and kitchen.	O
Redmond stop red means danger.	O
Red means a lot of different things, and directors cinematographers use that very liberally in telling their stories.	O
An it's just, you know, sometimes I can tell what's going to happen in a movie by, you know.	O
It's really easy if you're listening to the soundtrack.	O
The soundtrack changes, you know, somethings up, but you can also see subtle color shifts.	O
There was one movie I was watching.	O
I loved it an it was.	O
I think it was a single man.	O
Um, it was Colin Firth and he was basically this entire movie was centered around him deciding to commit suicide and then backing off that decision and they wanted the director, which is Tom Ford wanted to convey what it felt like to be kind of in that kind of in that Gray mode of depression where nothing has colored.	O
Nothing has vibrance.	O
And so that was reflected really in the movie.	O
So whenever he's in these situations where he's just not caring, there's just nothing here lighting up his life.	O
It's very desaturated colors and then all of a sudden moments of joy moments that bring him life.	O
The saturation just bus under the scene you can see you know the pink and the Rosen Peoples Chiefs.	O
You can see the blue in their eyes you can see all of these different details that you know in this character exit.	O
The scene exits the scene.	O
They take the brightness, they take the saturation.	O
And the life wisdom.	O
And he's back to left with his depression.	O
I mean, it's very interesting when you start to notice that and it kind of adds another layer of enjoyment to movies.	CHITCHAT
For me at least.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, so that's a little breakdown of this scene.	CHITCHAT
When you're looking at something like this to do a study of again, it just helps me to know where the study is coming from and where it's going, and for some reason I'm getting some frame drops right now, which is upsetting.	CHITCHAT
Turn on Internet.	CHITCHAT
Come back to me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, it looks like we're back.	CHITCHAT
Just a little bit of a blurb right there if you uhm.	CHITCHAT
If you don't see the red live, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Read on your screen.	O
Just hit refresh and we should get live again.	O
But it looks like I'm still live even though it looks like.	CHITCHAT
It looks like my.	CHITCHAT
My Behance back here is frozen but I'm just going to.	CHITCHAT
And then press on and hope that that it comes back.	CHITCHAT
Right now it looks like it's OK.	CHITCHAT
So that's the examining the scene on an actual script level.	O

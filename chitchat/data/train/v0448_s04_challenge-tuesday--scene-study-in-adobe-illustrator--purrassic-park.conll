But now let's look at it on the composition level.	O
So we have a center focus right here.	O
We've got our eggs right here.	O
We've got all of these characters looking here.	O
We've got this guy kinda looking Offen talking.	O
To Malcolm over here, so we've got kind of this wall cutting off here.	O
I like that 'cause it kind of anchors it over here and gives this center.	O
It is it a little balance with what's over here.	O
We've got the egg arm over here.	O
We've got this.	O
I guess this is some sort of a cryo thing in the background here.	O
I don't exactly remember what that is.	O
But we also have kind of if you're looking at the level of the heads here, we've got a little dip, so it's mainly center, but we kind of have a little bit of focus of over here, but await over here because of this guy in the separation ends.	O
Well, I think it's more angle this way too.	O
Lead into the scene where he comes out.	O
He followed him and the camera follows.	O
So that's kind of this set up there.	O
All right, So what I'm gonna do?	O
Is just think about this here.	O
I kind of want to figure out who my characters are going to be.	O
Definitely want El as the lawyer.	O
And I'm not really sure I kinda want this to be Momo Coco, an actually this needs to be tux.	O
And this I was thinking would be fat cat.	O
I don't have a Coco though.	O
And I kind of wanted this to be.	O
Maybe spring bear and they're going to be hatching little Floofs by the way, Um, Spring Bear.	O
My who would represent passion though.	O
I don't want to put happy there because have I don't want to contrast.	O
You know, the failings of of handling of happy.	O
Spring bear is a source of life in my comics, so I might keep spring bear an have you know, cute bear.	O
As a doctor will.	O
And Uhm.	CHITCHAT
If she is a very, she's often the underdog, but she did speak up a lot.	O
So I mean maybe that would make sense to have her as Ian.	O
I kinda like that.	O
An I I might have Coco here, just looking kind of have her paws up here and I'm going to have a large egg with a little flu.	O
Patching outta here.	O
I think that'll work.	O
And since I didn't catch this at the right moment, I'll have a.	O
I'll have a fat cat, maybe with one ear down and she's thinking she's not sure this whole situation.	O
Panic to convey what Ian's going through at this moment moment.	O
I really love that though I want to go back to that and just geek out one more time.	O
About this David and Goliath boom and boom.	O
It's just it's so cool, alright?	CHITCHAT
All right, so let's go ahead and do my quick sketch here.	O
I'm gonna I'm going to have that right Halo.	O
Down.	O
We've done this morning or maybe just show a little bit of it over here.	O
And let's go ahead, be level.	O
High level here.	O
Without Actually, it's a little bit above that.	O
It's kind of like right there.	O
Like this, let's see.	O
This is kind of like A.	O

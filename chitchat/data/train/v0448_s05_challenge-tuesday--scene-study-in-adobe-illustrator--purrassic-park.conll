It's a little trough, it looks like, so we've got the inside were all the grasses are sitting.	O
He got the incubation likes here.	O
We've got the face.	O
And you know this also gives you an opportunity to look in, especially if you're worried about your backgrounds and you know setting their seen you can really, if you take a screen cap of a movie, or you know animated feature and really examine it, break it down, look at all the different things that you don't necessarily notice when the picture is in motion.	O
You know we've got.	O
This does play a big part.	O
This is the arm that picks up the eggs and turns them some around.	O
But we also have, you know this lab equipment back here.	O
We have this.	O
Probably cry, oh whatever.	O
Freezy do thing back here.	O
We've got our we've got our glass in a hallway out here we've got the railing.	O
This is clearly an elevated platform and we're down in a pit.	O
And then we've got these concrete walls coming over here.	O
We've got lines.	O
Kind of establishing an boxing us into focus right on this moment.	O
Ann This really, you know.	O
Was that moment and try to see it see everything that's adding up to make.	O
Um, make you focus where you're focusing and get the story that you're getting.	O
I mean, even with the characters, we can see you know the and you can think about this when you're doing your own characters.	O
You know if they're in this lab thing, we've got lab codes.	O
We've got people with rubber gloves on we've got.	O
All the stuff we got, maybe some safety equipment in the background and now you can kind of rundown those things you know.	O
Like if I have a scene in a school, you know if this is in a science lab, well, what's in the science lab?	O
Let me remember when I was back in school in a science lab, what do we have?	O
We have the eye wash station.	O
We had vent hoods.	O
We had areas where all of the beakers and all of the equipment was kept.	O
We had, you know, XY, Z and then you can use that to start informing their scenes.	O
And if you don't have experience with that.	O
Look up pictures in reference and use those references.	O
There is nothing, nothing, nothing wrong with reference.	O
In fact, how can you fill up your mental banks if you don't use reference?	O
So he ever feel.	O
I see that argument come up, you know, I remember in Devianart there is, you know, kind of a plague of it.	O
I didn't use any reference and you know it was kind of almost appointed bragging.	O
And I'm like you know you can kind of tell you can't use reference, so I mean.	O
And a lot of people then would say like, well, maybe I shouldn't use reference.	O
Maybe it has past, you know, not something I should do.	O
Maybe maybe I need to push myself to not use it and.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
I am trying in red and I'm not used to drawing in red.	O
I don't like drawing in red were gonna not drawn red anymore.	O
There we go better.	O
So I just want to get the general Gist Aviston Down.	O
I've got my bowl.	O
No, go ahead and.	O
Probably make this whole deal over the smaller.	O
Either that or I'm gonna make my canvas.	O
Maybe I'll just go ahead and punch my canvas a little wider.	O
So 16 nine ratio.	O
Now we've got our longer here.	O
I thought my little bear and he's gonna be.	O
I'm going to change the story a little bit.	O
Maybe the bear isn't exactly 'cause this isn't.	O
This is the most sinister situation as what was going on here, so I gotta bear here.	O
And that cute bear here.	O
I've got Momo taxi in like Oh my gosh.	O

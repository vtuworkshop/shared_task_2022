Mulan Might bring up a little bit because these are cats.	O
Yeah, let's see.	CHITCHAT
We've got this coming with cryogen thing that here.	O
I'm going to have to have the arm over here.	O
Can I might do?	O
So now we have this.	O
The scene pretty much constructed.	O
And what I'm going to do.	O
Another interesting note.	O
I mentioned the white and the black lawyers and Gray.	O
He's kind of neutral between.	O
He's only focused on the money, so he doesn't really care about this or this.	O
Is that another dynamic?	O
It's kind of interesting.	O
'cause you know, think about it.	O
Directors, cinematographers, costumers.	O
They can choose any color they want, the colors they choose are very specific and therefore reason.	O
So as a movie viewer you can.	O
That's another game you can play.	O
You can ask yourself why this color.	O
Why is this color advises character always in red?	O
Why are they always in blue?	O
Why are they, you know?	O
Why are there colors dark and you know, maybe desaturated, or you know?	O
And who are they in relation to the other characters?	O
Now?	O
There's a very in case you know.	O
Didn't notice it in the scene while this actually.	O
It's later in the movie there in the cars and Ian is kind of messing with ham and an handfuls away from the camera and he's just like I hate that man.	O
Black and white, you know, logic versus.	O
Once again.	O
All right, So what I do now is I drop this down and.	O
I start night a line art.	O
Let's see who do I want to start with?	O
Actually, I think I'm going to make this a bowl full of loose.	O
I like that idea.	CHITCHAT
Trying to figure out where I want to start.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's just start over here and this is the concrete and let go ahead and just use my special.	O
Shift toward draw straight line and it kind of angle it just a smidge.	O
I'm gonna go ahead and create the station that will make all the props and stuff like that so the centerpiece of course is this.	O
Like that curve, but it doesn't.	O
Isn't going where it should.	O
What should I do normally?	O
Do Sanchez come around to that again?	O
Take this.	O
And I'm going to reflect it, so we have.	O
Perfect match.	O
Not right there.	O
I'm glad you like it, at least.	O
So I mean, you know, sometimes it depending on you know what type of study they're doing.	O
If you're trying to really actually just studied, seen straight.	O
Or you're trying to adapt it?	O
Like I am.	O
Yeah, maybe the story and knowing was before and after isn't all that important.	O
If it's just a straight study, but I still like to do it so this is a little less sinister than creating you know, dinosaurs that could potentially become the apex predator and take our place.	O
Their little floofs Not be kind of, you know.	O
Sad is this loose went extinct.	O

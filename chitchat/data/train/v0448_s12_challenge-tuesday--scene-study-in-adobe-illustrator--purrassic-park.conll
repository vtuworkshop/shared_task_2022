I think I'm going to have to look at save if you have it now.	CHITCHAT
I'm curious to see what he's been in recently.	CHITCHAT
I am busy 'cause there was something I was just let me know.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Freedom flight a Guinea pig Kajol?	CHITCHAT
He's coming back in Jurassic World Dominion.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'm excited.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know that.	CHITCHAT
OK, So what else is he in it?	CHITCHAT
I just thought.	CHITCHAT
I saw Peter Rabbit, but I don't remember him in there.	CHITCHAT
Shoot there something you just song.	CHITCHAT
I don't see anything.	CHITCHAT
The commuter I remember that one that one was with Liam Neeson.	CHITCHAT
It was taken on the train, kind of.	CHITCHAT
Ha.	O
He's been.	CHITCHAT
Busy, which is good and it makes me happy.	CHITCHAT
I know, right?	CHITCHAT
I can't wait to see him come back, oh.	CHITCHAT
I don't think.	CHITCHAT
He was, I think he's the last one from the original cast that has.	CHITCHAT
Never come back.	CHITCHAT
Until now, 'cause I know why it was he.	CHITCHAT
Did he come back in one of the lesser sequels?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
'cause I know that Ellie she came back.	CHITCHAT
So all the way back to the 90s, OKC.	CHITCHAT
Run up to over dress park.	CHITCHAT
OK, so he did come back in Jurassic Park three and I do not remember is that the one where?	CHITCHAT
Who's in this?	CHITCHAT
One way much Macy Tea Leoni.	CHITCHAT
I don't remember this one.	CHITCHAT
I know I saw it, but I really don't remember it that well.	CHITCHAT
So he came back in history.	CHITCHAT
He skipped out too, which was.	CHITCHAT
I think that was with Julianne Moore.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
In Malcolm King, back in that one, and then there was another one before the reboot, which had, I think Shyla Booth in it or something.	CHITCHAT
And that's the only one that, yeah, that's the only one I've seen.	CHITCHAT
Interesting.	CHITCHAT
I was excited for new dress, partly.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I've gotten most of this background done.	O
I think I'll probably do a little texture on the wall back there later, maybe some.	O
Maybe someone?	CHITCHAT
Drop a couple of values.	O
I want to get this light grouped.	O
Sun group that.	O
And with that.	O
I think now I am ready to.	O
From this house and I might drop it down, I think I need to get.	O
Add a little bit.	O
Alright, let's start filling this out with little floofs in graphs.	O
So now my main is going to be right here.	O
I'm gonna have characters here, here and here.	O
So I'm gonna have maybe.	O
Maybe I'm going to have things kind of building up and be waited over here.	O

Dresser in this and Bradstreet.	O
I keep the rest of her intact because I may or may not move her later, so maybe I'll show the feet.	O
Maybe I won't.	O
I usually draw a little bit outside of my art board, just as a habit.	O
Alright, My Converse.	O
All this good stuff because she's holding on to the clipboard that point, you know, I kind of like the look of those pages crawling up.	O
I don't need it.	O
Let's examine this right here.	O
Make sure father is clear and not shoot.	O
Where you coming from?	CHITCHAT
Your arm, right?	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Then make this a little.	O
I'm gonna come in here and let's take this line out here with it years.	O
Maybe she's got a new baby floof on her on her head right here.	O
Maybe this is just curious to see what she was doing.	O
She don't need that headline anymore, but I do need her zipper.	O
So we're going to come over here.	O
She spends the pursuit.	O
Little tails peeking out.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
I had, that's just the forward character, but I kind of like where this is going.	O
It's a little bit, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
There's no.	O
Velociraptors and.	O
T.	O
Rex is even I adore him.	O
Something a little bit softer.	O
Alright, so now that I've got this doctor in the front, this lab tech.	O
Technically Doctor Blue.	O
I'm going to make her a little bit bigger to kind of frame out.	O
See my foreground elements 'cause she's standing away from the group.	O
Um, so she can be kind of this story here.	O
Which is this right here?	O
Where Doctor Who was talking to deal with?	O
An in the interest of.	O
Composition I'm probably going to next hour.	O
I feel bad already.	O
I think I'm going to next him because he's really kind of he's pacing around on the outside.	O
I think I'll just have spring bear El, Moe, Moe and tux, and then Coco looking wherever she's going to be.	O
So let's go out the level and then save because saving is good and what I'm going to do is I am going to take a quick stretch and yeah my back just popped.	O
I'm going to take a quick stretch and hydration break so I encourage you to do so as well.	O
I will be are be real quick and then I'll get the rest of this line art dropped in here.	O
And then I'll start the coloring process.	O
Hopefully I'll be able to get done in the last hour and a half on stream, so be are be.	O

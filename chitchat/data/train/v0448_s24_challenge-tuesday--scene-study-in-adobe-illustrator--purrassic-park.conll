Let me.	O
And you zoom out.	O
Here we go.	O
I've got my characters here is kind of a mess right now, so I haven't deleted any of the.	O
Here that will make it easier to see, so I've got my characters or surrounding the hatching platform and instead of dinosaurs theraflu skiing hatched.	O
I've got my my little lab worker right here and I think I'm going to make her just a little bit bigger and more in the foreground right here an I might move this over little bit so you get see more coconut.	O
And I have to go in here and drop some things out of the scene.	O
Like where this background is coming in.	O
It's not going to, of course overlap on my characters.	O
And then I've got this essential scene where everybody's gathered around the hatching.	O
Hatching area, Anna just locking and erasing some lines I don't need coconuts here in front so there's a lot of stuff that.	O
I'm not going to need.	O
I'll need a little bit of her foot, but not a lot.	O
And go.	O
Look It is such a good funny movie.	O
Coconuts, not sure if she wants to meet the newly hatched use.	O
The last thing I'm going to do is drop in evil landlord up here.	O
And.	O
And then I might strengthen some of these lines.	O
And then I'll go through and start coloring here.	O
Actually pretty pretty shortly.	O
Once I get everybody figured out where they're going to go.	O
So I started racing some of these lines that I don't need.	O
Facebook.	O
I'm also going to have.	O
I could have just done that lot easier.	O
All right, so let's go ahead and erase this.	O
I don't need it.	O
And normally I keep a lot of us in here, but I'm just gonna.	O
Do it like this today.	O
I've got more mochi taza.	O
Get there early.	O
I always forget her name.	O
And then doctor grant is taxi.	O
I've got evil.	O
Landlord is up.	O
Here is the lawyer.	O
I've taken her out of the scene 'cause the lawyer was right here in the actual movie, but I think I've got it crowded pretty much how it is.	O
So I want to.	O
Open it up a little bit and so I put her upstairs.	O
On this little balcony area in doorway to the Cryo Chamber.	O
Protein bar, but then where they store all the embryos, I guess that would be.	O
Things up a little bit here.	O
Yeah no, it'll be a lot of fun.	O
Specially the color of Miss 'cause I'm going to have a strong light coming from the.	O
From the.	O
The.	O
Incubator light up here and then.	O
Kind of I think it's going to be warm, light and then I'm going to try to push.	O

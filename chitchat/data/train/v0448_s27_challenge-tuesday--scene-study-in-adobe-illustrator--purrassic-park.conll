Yeah so far.	O
At 11 Alright, especially different group.	O
I need to go over here in a race it from this week.	O
She's going to fall into this phone here.	O
And she's holding onto his phone here.	O
She's got her plot on.	O
Maybe I'll do a little bit.	O
I kind of need to hurt foot kind of disappears too much there.	O
I want to do a little bit more foot.	O
So let's go over here and maybe just do a little bit of her little fluffy foot coming there.	O
Thank you, see it there we go.	O
So it looks like she's got.	O
She's hanging on to this edge right here.	O
How do I make us a little bit so it looks like her paws going over the bar?	O
Races In the background, so :) with you.	O
Miss that now.	O
And clean up any other stray pieces that I've got.	O
She's a very fluffy character too.	O
She's kind of.	O
I kind of think of a lot of them.	O
I think of a sack of flour when I'm drawing them, as they've got a very floppy, um, soft doughy body.	O
And so she's one of those.	O
So like if you're looking at a flower stack, you can see how it would twist an intern.	O
Like if a flour sack were standing and holding on to the railing, they might look like that.	O
They've got this kind of the weight of their body is kind of Boeing this direction.	O
Because I've got their footers up like that and they're holding arm of this, so I've got the same thing.	O
She's got longer arms though, and little paws that she can curl over.	O
It's an easy shape to manipulate and I do that a lot when I'm drawing.	O
I kind of simplify things down as much as I can so I can move it around in space easier.	O
Alright, so there's the line art.	O
What I'm going to do now since I'm keeping this.	O
I know that's foreground.	O
Oh, I need to do one thing.	O
You need to come out of the background.	O
In your little foot piece in this to come with you.	O
Alright, let's go out that level.	O
Cut her out of here and I want to put her in this background with level.	O
Hips.	O
There we go.	O
Alright, so now she's where she belongs and the reason I did that is because.	O
Oh, things aren't group like they should be.	O
There.	O
Is because I am going to set some of these elements.	O
To be on.	O
Alright, let's say OK, let me just go at it from.	O
Let's just go at it for an all all over so I'm picking my Brown line cut.	O
And this middle ground.	O
I want this back here.	O
All of this to be.	O
Further away.	O
So what I'm going to do?	O
Is I'm going to.	O
Push desaturate the color.	O
Open camera.	O
Send it a little bit further so the darkest is going to be, and then I'm going to also send all of this.	O
When a group it send it to back.	O
So this right here and this and this I'm going to group as before ground because their standing in front of everyone else.	O
This is going to be in shadow.	O
This is going to be in light, so this section with the incubator light is going to be kind of medium.	O

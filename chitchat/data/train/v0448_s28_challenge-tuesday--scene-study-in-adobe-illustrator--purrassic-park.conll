So I want to push the brightness up on that, maybe saturation up a little bit.	O
So now you can see I kind of have some.	O
Some death in it now.	O
Lips.	O
Just get rid of those guys.	O
And to push that even further, I'm going to start, I'm going to do something like this so.	O
I'm gonna say This guy is standing.	O
Of course he's standing further away from the light main light sources right here, and so I'm going to put this guy.	O
Let me go into this area where I've proved these two.	O
I'm going to say this arm.	O
Is not stationary.	O
It can move around the floor.	O
That's just making that excuse.	O
It's up here instead of right beside the incubator.	O
I don't remember in the movies that is so.	O
Wanna do is I'm going to have these guys they can.	O
I'll be mostly in shadow.	O
And I'll clean up those lines later.	O
'cause he standing by this wall in this wall could be blocking majority of the light and I didn't need to do that and fix that later.	O
I'm gonna drop this down to like something like this.	O
Maybe 50.	O
I still want you to see her.	O
But she's just on a different part of the floor.	O
But mine was right there.	O
OK, so we're doing.	O
Here is I'm going to.	O
Follow this lines, yet maybe lights coming over Super.	O
Those are really coming just looks for me this is more.	O
No.	O
More in my life than the other chasers.	O
It is still hot too.	O
Do something like that to frame missile scene.	O
So now I've got a very square focus right here, and that focus is going to be also highlighted here, because this light source right here is going to be.	O
Tennis His former Boston.	O
So, but now you see in my focus is.	O
And I kind of want to erase all those bits.	O
But I don't.	O
Because what if I want to use that just that section?	O
I'll leave it how it is.	O
Hey.	CHITCHAT
How is second dropping frames again?	O
Hopefully I'm back.	O
It looks up for golf now we're going up and down.	O
Let me do a.	O
Speed test to see if it's me.	O
'cause I just got my order place yesterday.	O
That's definitely not download.	O
And my upload is good, so I'm not sure what's causing this problem.	O
It looks like a bathroom.	O
I'm in a refreshingly of the accounts page to make sure that I'm back.	O
It doesn't look like it.	O
It looks like it's still buffering.	O
So once again, I'm going to press on, so let's see I want this section to.	O
I'm gonna just start not usually start this way.	O
But I kind of want to start with this.	O
That section.	O
I'm just trying to think about the colors I want this is going to be very green and warm because we've got the incubator here, but if I'm going according to the original scene.	O

Then you can kind of get that here.	O
You see the warmth from this light, but everything else around it is very cold.	O
So in blue and sterile.	O
You can see the blue light coming.	O
From there you can see.	O
Now I want to do this.	O
Why don't I think about that and start with this foreground?	O
So let's get my colors here.	O
Let's think about.	O
I have several different characters.	O
One has an orange cat.	O
So I'm gonna get her colors in here.	O
Let's get her Browns.	O
I've got another character that is, uhm.	O
She's got a little bit of lighter.	O
Brown color, so I have a lot of rounds in here, but then this lab.	O
Is very cool.	CHITCHAT
So when I get some Blues in there too.	O
You get some of those colors.	O
Some kind of Grey Blues.	O
And they have a light yellow.	O
Nice.	O
Incubator light Pinks maybe?	O
Alright, so for my bears I've got spring bear, she's green.	O
Her main highlight colors and then this.	O
This bear is just a random bear.	O
I guess it's maybe she'll be keep their, maybe she'll be cute bear.	O
In that case she's Blues, so Blues and whites, so that's OK.	O
And then let's see.	O
And this is going to be kind of like a lab facility.	O
Original is.	O
Like Made of cement.	O
So I want some of those.	O
Cement colors Some of these all over place here I need grass is for the incubator.	O
Another see taxi is Gray and I need a red and a blue.	O
I've got my red I've got my blue calling me to saturate those a little more.	O
There we go.	O
And then I thought, let's do this real quick over here.	O
I need to erase this little bit here where he's holding on to the edge.	O
Mr Bashan Defend against that wall mounted.	O
It's a shirt which is not going to be seen, but for my purposes on make sure.	O
That's racist.	O
So.	O
So back up here.	O
The SUVs are going to be kind of like like the same body color as coconut and and she's pause, so that's kind of a whitish kind of little tinted orange.	O
I think I'm ready to start clothing.	O

Let's make this small little darker.	O
Only go ahead and put her paws in here.	O

And then I'll come back in and put in another colors 'cause I've got her lab suit.	O
And even though these aren't on canvas.	O
And the go ahead and color in her little folders too, because I may end up moving things around and it will save you time later if I decide to do something different.	O

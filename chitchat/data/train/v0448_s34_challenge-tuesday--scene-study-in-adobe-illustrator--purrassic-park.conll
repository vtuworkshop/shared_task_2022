I only have the merge only.	O
Activated and that allows me to select what I want to select and then I can.	O
I can drop it.	O
I kind of like a Green Green Bowl.	O
Um, this kind of cute.	CHITCHAT
I like it, let's see.	O
Do I want to keep?	O
And just have the light of that app.	O
I kind of like that.	O
Percy Um?	O
That way I can select things in edit somehow.	O
I need them to be.	O
I'm going to do something here.	O
Oh, I like that darn it.	O
OK, I keep on doing things I like.	CHITCHAT
Not intending to.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I want that one to be dead.	O
Yeah, it needs to go to a darker color.	O
Again.	O
Here we go.	O
And this.	O

Cancel.	O
Thank you so much Cheryl.	O
Yeah, let me back out and show the whole lustration	O
I've got everybody's crowded around the hatching table, and then I've got eelma background.	O
I've got my lab bear and a couple of hash groups here, and the last thing I'll do is the background with her.	O
I'm probably not going to make it too detailed with color because this is the focus right here.	O
But yeah, I really like how this is turning out.	O
Jurassic Park is like one of my favorite movies so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I enjoy doing some studies and anything to do with it.	O
I didn't know until I recent.	O
I just looked it up while I was streaming just now.	O
Um, in the Jurassic World, Dominion than you.	O
The new one coming out.	O
Doctor Grant returns.	O
Which on is exciting?	O
And I'm going to have like a Halo around here, so something probably something like this that you won't see.	O
And so I have my background filled in.	O
Do a boy are on it.	O
And then I'm gonna do, probably.	O
Chop it down.	O
And maybe do a color Dodge on it.	O
And then I'll have my characters.	O
Now let's go ahead and fill those guys in.	O
I've got just a few about 10 more minutes with you guys, and I think I could look.	O
Let's go out one level.	O
I think I can get at least the basic colours building on these guys, so this character is spring bear and her ear color is.	O
Green And she's not wearing her little head scarf.	O

She's got socks white socks on all four feet, and he has a triangle of light right here, so it looks like you know, a jacket showing the white of a shirt underneath.	O
Go back to the color layer, and since he's Gray, I kinda like to go around this range.	O
A little bit dark vertucci.	O
Respond him up a few more.	O
There we go.	O
And we have a little bit of his great for showing right here.	O
And I have a little bit of his grave for showing here.	O
I didn't draw his tail, but I can.	O
Let me just drop that aren't even on.	O
And something so completionist out at that line is not where it should be.	O
There we go.	O
Back to color layer on my grabbed his grey.	O
You don't hear you send that to the back, it said.	O
Any advice for someone trying to learn backgrounds and building study architecture?	O
Who yes, I do have some tips there.	O
How much?	O
Just a second?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So if you're doing architecturally focused backgrounds like cityscapes and stuff, I would really work on your perspective grids.	O
2.3 point perspective.	O
Move the camera around in really push yourself like do you know.	O
Kind of like a bird's eye view or Batman view from the top of the building looking down.	O
Really push yourself on, you know where your positioning that camera and that perspective grid an repeat that.	O
Just until you can do it from memory and you can kind of see the grid without having to draw it out.	O
That's kind of what I did with when I was trying to push composition.	O
I would draw my grids out an place all my characters you know at the certain points that I wanted them to be, but I started every single drawing out by drawing that grid so I could look at a page.	O
Now an pretty much you know, see exactly where the lines would be in the proportions would be and.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Every now and again I check it and sure enough, everything is where it should be, but that's because I drilled myself on that and I did it so often that if he came second nature, so that's what I would do.	O
If you're you know, if you really want to study cityscapes architecture, just get really familiar with those perspective grids.	O
And then there are a lot of great architecture books out there, and you can have one.	O
It's in here anymore.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
There are a couple of others like you know, here's another one I really enjoy.	O
This guy is he lives in Japan.	O
He does.	CHITCHAT
He does a lot of watercolors, but it's of this is Japanese storefronts.	O
There really tall and thin, but the detail in each one of them is incredible and just one of these can create a beautiful of a beautiful background for a scheme.	O
I mean, look at that.	O
And that's just incredible.	O
And he goes through and he talks about.	O
Here is an example of how he breaks things up.	O
You can kind of see it there.	O
He kind of divides it up.	O
On the grid.	O
But that's a front perspective, so it'll be, you know, a little bit different.	O
But Even so he did another one with Tokyo night scapes.	O
And he walked around.	O
I believe he takes pictures and then he comes back and does some studies.	O
But these have different angles.	O
Or you're seeing.	O
See all of that.	O
Another thing you can do is take pictures, go on walks you know, walk around the city.	O
Walked around areas where there are a lot of buildings.	O
Start taking pictures, then take those pictures and try to draw them.	O
Try to really see what's in the picture.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But But yeah, but that's a focus on cityscapes or really anything.	O
You know that you're looking at if you want to do.	O
Natural landscapes and stuff like that.	O

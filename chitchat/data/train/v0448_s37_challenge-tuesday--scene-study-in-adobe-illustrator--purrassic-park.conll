You know, a great source for a lot of that, and that's what I'm doing.	O
Here are movies and seen studies because they're they're in any given movie.	O
There's probably you know, five or six different locations, and you can look at how you know frame was composed, their how they set things up, how they set characters up to tell a story, and the environment kind of set the stage.	O
For that you can see a lot of clues and things to learn from in those as well.	O
But yeah, I mean just you know, another thing that would be really awesome is sit down with a sketchbook and watch one of your favorite movies and then just start sketching out the scenes and it'll layouts.	O
Pause it every now and then or try to push yourself and do it in time because that's kind of like gesture drawing when you're in figure drawing class, you're not allowed to sit there and sit there and meticulously.	O
Detail this figure drawing you're getting maybe 30 seconds before they're switching to the next pozan.	O
You're just getting the gesture, the line, the action of it, and then you go back later and fill in the detail.	O
So that's something you can do when you're just trying to capture the composition of a scene or in, like you know, cityscapes.	O
For example, how the buildings are stacked in, how that lines up with what's happening with your characters, and what's happening in this scene.	O
Into the spider verse is incredible.	O
In that way you just, you know, can sit there and just absorb all of that.	O
Set design an it the color designed to everything in that movie is just.	O
I mean, I've watched it several times and it's just, you know, I seem to see something new each time that really is inspiring, but you can just sit down, you know, kind of immerse yourself in that and really pay attention to.	O
What's making that movie so you know meat and you know when you see a scene that's really emotionally charged.	O
Pause it and break it down and see what's going on in this.	O
There's a lot of light here.	O
There's a lot of contrast.	O
You know.	O
There's these colors are associated with danger or or peace and tranquility and really breakdown that scene and try to see through.	O
What's happening to see kind of the invisible ink underneath that's making the scene?	O
You can, let's see, um.	O
I'm trying to think of what other some other good ones are, but yeah, I mean always.	O
You know, if you at the base of anything you want to improve on.	O
Make yourself a habit of practice.	O
Not only backgrounds, buildings, architecture, that if you're in a habit of practicing, you're going to learn a lot faster than if you're just drawing when you feel like it, or drawing when the mood hits, you force yourself to do at least 30 minutes a day and you will improve very quickly.	O
It doesn't.	O
They don't all have to be masterpieces.	O
They don't all have to be something you're going to post on Instagram are show to other people.	O
The point for a lot of it is not to say that accountability isn't good.	O
That can actually.	O
If you say look, I'm going to make dailies and post them on.	O
Instagram that accountability will help keep you too it, especially in the early days but.	O
Is that not your deal?	O
But being able to say you know, personally, hey, I've done this and I've not broken the chain and you know, I give myself these rules that help me keep it even on days when things are rough.	O
You know, give yourself at least 30 minutes.	O
You can find 30 minutes because usually if you're really motivated to watch a show on Netflix or something, will find 30 minutes to do it or even the hour.	O
So find that 30 minutes to practice for yourself to improve your art an.	O
So that some of the best advice I can give on it on improving that in its general innocence.	O
Look for references.	O
Study the world around you.	O
Work on your fundamentals and make those fundamentals.	O
Just almost automatic and keep practicing them.	O
Don't say OK, I've studied this for you know three or four months on the master, you're never mastered.	O
You always need to be learning, growing and coming back and practicing those fundamentals.	O
Why do you see you know these artists that are really, you know, at the top of their game they're studying the same things over and over body composition.	O
There's there setting gestures, their studying.	O
You know anatomy.	O
They're drawing the same things over and over and over again, and there's a reason for that.	O
So get that in the, you know.	O

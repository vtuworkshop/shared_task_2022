Hey Steven, what's up?	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
I'm kind of feeling like my voice is kind of going out today, but I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
Um, anyway, so we're starting with a blank canvas today.	O
I'm thinking I kind of want to do a Cinderella seen, um?	O
I kind of wanted to do this thing for a long time, but I've tried to do it a couple of different times and it never came out the way I wanted it too.	O
So I am just going to bite the bullet and try it again on stream.	O
I don't know how well the sketch is going to come out or or what, but I guess we will see.	O
It is I don't know if any of you guys are.	O
Fans of Cinderella.	O
But it is the sing sweet Nightingale scene.	O
Where Cinderella is.	O
Um, cleaning the floor and there's like colorful bubbles and and things everywhere.	O
And I'm going to kind of get some reference, but also make it my own and make it in my own personal style.	O
So we will see how that goes.	O
Anatomy with humans isn't always isn't always the best, so I'm I'm never sure how how it's going to workout.	O
But let me grab my friend so I should have done this before I went live.	O
Sorry about that.	O
We fingernail?	O
Images.	O
So yeah, it's this scene, so I'm probably going to do, um.	O
Let's see.	O

I can't listen part of it.	CHITCHAT
Oh Forgot to.	CHITCHAT
Look my video.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to use part of my screen for my canvas and part of it for Chrome.	O
And for Cezanne, did you hear that they're canceling the Halloween events?	CHITCHAT
I mean, I understand, but it doesn't mean I'm happy.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, I didn't hear that.	CHITCHAT
That sucks.	CHITCHAT
the Halloween events are great actually.	CHITCHAT
My husband, um, if you look at our proposal photos, he he proposed to me in front of The Walt Disney statue in Disneyland at Halloween time.	CHITCHAT
There's like I think it was.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, yeah, I think it was like right before Halloween.	CHITCHAT
It was like October 24th I think and said there were pumpkins everywhere.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's grab this and so I'm kind of feeling.	O
I want to do a full scene with a background in everything.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Just do a little thumbnail here.	O
Really fast.	O
So I want to do like a flat flooring like I did for the last illustration.	O
It's going to be.	O
So the pattern for the flooring is going to be the style.	O
Looks like.	O
Oh, here's a good video of it.	O
So we're going to do a flat pattern.	O
OK, so this flooring goes straight up and straight down, so there's just like big tiles like this.	O
And then.	O
Between.	O
Those tiles.	O
There are little diamond tiles.	O
We're going to do forced perspective on the flooring.	O
Yes.	O
And I want to draw in those little columns there.	O
I think that looks really nice.	O
Um, let's do the wall also.	O
So the wall comes out like this.	O
And there's wainscoting.	O
And.	O
Spring will go a little bit farther.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Take it go.	O
I might end up zooming this in because I don't want the background to be the focal point I want.	O
Cinderella, beautiful point.	O
Hope this isn't too small for you guys to see I like to like draw really zoomed out when I'm doing the thumbnail.	O
So I hope you guys can see what I'm doing here.	O
And the waynes coding goes.	O
Of there.	CHITCHAT

And.	O
Do the columns on a separate layer.	O
To like one on either side, I'm thinking.	O
I'm just gonna do, I'm flat.	O
So it looks like they come up like this.	O
And it goes up again once more and up.	O
Again.	O
The piece that.	O
Then there's.	O
The Little Oval shape.	O
There.	O
How has your week been?	CHITCHAT
By the way everyone.	CHITCHAT
Guys, doing anything exciting.	CHITCHAT
I know I asked that like pretty much every stream but I actually am curious not just asking you for the sake of asking you.	CHITCHAT
Just curious what goes on in all your guises lives outside of the stream.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm just nosey.	CHITCHAT
And I can just copy paste.	O
I'll be in paste this column.	O
I might No, I might change the perspective.	O
Look at work.	O
They will fix all of.	O
Um, and there also are actually columns in the corners here.	O

So then we still have all of the details done.	O
But we can zoom it in once we go to.	O
Draw Cinderella.	O
And so that way the background isn't the focal point is right now with this composition in the background is definitely the focal.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So there's this.	O
Fun little.	O
Wings coding design.	O
All is well.	O
Make it go all the way up, I think.	O
Oh my hand moved.	O
Even says right now my life is pretty much work day job, not art.	O

Be handsome, sleep.	O
Hey, that's kind of my life too.	O

The little design here.	O
And.	O

That tells you how old it is like I haven't used devianart so long.	CHITCHAT
Like so long, at least like.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, it's probably been close to 10 years.	CHITCHAT
At this point.	CHITCHAT
I haven't used even art.	CHITCHAT
I'm fairly certain.	CHITCHAT
Well, I I think I was mostly doing my Disney Fanart in let's see.	CHITCHAT
Trying to think of my timeline, um.	CHITCHAT
I think it was probably around.	CHITCHAT
2015 or 16.	CHITCHAT
Check out my Deviantart.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you know what I probably could just.	CHITCHAT
I could probably just Google, Cody Bear Disney art.	CHITCHAT
It'll probably come up, yeah?	CHITCHAT
So here's some of my office here.	CHITCHAT
Some of my old stuff.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, it's so bad.	CHITCHAT
Uh, so bad.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I did a little self portrait with the Disney Disney ears on oh and I did this along time ago.	CHITCHAT
Just Bell piece that was kind of like before I really found my style.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, here's a Jasmine.	CHITCHAT
Peace and.	CHITCHAT
Woody and buzz.	CHITCHAT
and I did this Peter Pan.	CHITCHAT
This one was done.	CHITCHAT
This one wasn't even done in Photoshop.	CHITCHAT
These were all all these Princess ones were done in um.	CHITCHAT
Paint tool Sai.	CHITCHAT
Before I even started learning photo shop.	CHITCHAT
So these ones are really old.	CHITCHAT
I think these ones were like 2011.	CHITCHAT
But these actually weren't the ones I was talking about.	CHITCHAT
I forgot that those ones existed.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and I did this Adventure Time 10.	CHITCHAT
Here's a guest on one that I did.	CHITCHAT
Um, these are kind of the ones that I was thinking of.	CHITCHAT
I did like a whole series of the.	CHITCHAT
Princesses and the villains.	CHITCHAT
I never finished it, but like here's Belle and beast.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Here's aerial.	O
There was one.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is my Cinderella back in the day.	CHITCHAT
Um, see.	CHITCHAT
I know I did Ursula.	CHITCHAT
Oh here's Marty McFly.	CHITCHAT
Um, look up.	CHITCHAT
Pretty bare or Ursula.	CHITCHAT
It's not coming up, that's weird.	CHITCHAT
The Earth Aloe one is like one of my more popular Disney ones.	CHITCHAT
That's interesting.	CHITCHAT
Oh, here's The Lion King one.	CHITCHAT
I totally forgot about that one.	CHITCHAT
Paddington Oh my gosh, this stuff is so old.	CHITCHAT
Half of the stuff I don't even remember making.	CHITCHAT
And a little.	CHITCHAT
Punk kid.	CHITCHAT
It's weird that the Earth alone isn't coming out.	CHITCHAT
Hey Darius, how are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the stream.	CHITCHAT
Or just kind of A?	CHITCHAT
Searching through my old artwork, my old Disney artwork.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we are almost done with these diamonds here.	O
I'm just going to do.	O
The bottom half of these ones.	O
And that looks good.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna do the columns on a separate layer.	O
Let's do, uhm.	O
Vertical line.	O
So we can get.	O
Center point for this.	O
And I'll even do the vertical line on a separate layer.	O
And.	O
Hold shift on these bottom parts.	O
Oh, I didn't even realize I'm my cameras in front of where I'm drawing.	CHITCHAT

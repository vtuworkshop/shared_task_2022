I think this is coming together like it looks.	O
Not that great right now, just because it's just like a flat sketch, but I'm feeling good about it.	O
That's and that's what matters, right?	O
I'm feeling good about it.	CHITCHAT
OK, I know my camera is like totally blocking you know what?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll move my camera to the other side.	CHITCHAT
Please.	CHITCHAT
Or instead of moving my camera, I could just.	CHITCHAT
The photo shop to the.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Now you guys can see the full thing.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So Oh yeah, now let's uhm condense these layers down.	O
That's the column layers.	O
Don't need this layer anymore.	O
And let's move.	O
1 second photo shop is acting up.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Happy pig and let's move this guy over to the other side.	O
He shone walking up the stream.	O
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
We are currently working on a a Cinderella piece.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I don't know if you've ever seen Cinderella before.	O
Maybe you have, maybe you haven't, but we are working on recreating the sing sweet Nightingale scene.	O
In my style, of course.	O
Working on that that super strong force perspective on the flooring here.	O
Going real flat today.	O
OK, so let's look at this wall.	O
Same design, oh, you know what?	O
Actually, there's a line connecting.	O
Didn't even notice this, but there's a line connecting these pieces.	O
And also, there's another little squirrely do.	O
On that side.	O
But Great background, oh, thank you, I really appreciate that because up until this point I've kind of been like questioning the way the direction that I was going like.	O
I was just saying a minute ago like I don't like it looks.	O
I think it's going to look fine once we continue to work with it.	O
But I'm feeling kind of confident ish.	O
With the sketch so far, but we'll see where it goes.	O
Of course I'm leaving the hardest part to the to the end, which is drawing Cinderella.	O
I kind of do that, um, on purpose, sometimes because.	O
Uhm, I have had a tendency to like if I if I'm fail at drawing the human anatomy a mile, just give up on the entire peace.	O
But if I actually put work into the background, it makes me feel it gives me more motivation to actually work harder at the anatomy because I'm like, well, I already put in hours and hours into this into this background.	O
I'm not just going to give up, give up on it and throw it away so.	O
I do that on purpose, kind of.	O
Uhm, OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh I, I still need to do the designs on the backs of the walls here.	O

Just trying about the first thing that comes to mind when you depict a certain culture.	O
A species in fantasy.	O
And then just support that it is a good way to to get it more interesting from the start.	O
But that's just a general assumption, general.	O
Thing I.	O
Often think about that has nothing to do with.	O
Specific characters you it will further people especially.	O
They awesome, yeah, they most most likely know already who the characters are and what they do and where and like.	O
But you can always take a characters and refine them even more and make them more interesting afterwards.	O
Especially if they if you have been through some adventures.	O
And they have had experiences with you playing them.	O
But you can.	O
Bring into it.	O
And it's just the dry throat, no?	O
No worries, I'm not going today.	CHITCHAT
I'm talking too much.	CHITCHAT
Too much too low.	CHITCHAT

Miss water.	CHITCHAT
Unless Apple.	CHITCHAT
I don't like Apple.	CHITCHAT
I mean I, I don't.	CHITCHAT
Just like it in general, but I really don't drink much.	CHITCHAT
Throughout to see me drink alcohol.	CHITCHAT
As far as the task, that way, actually I do have a lot of Apple at home, but that's because I never drink it, so.	CHITCHAT
Having a party which I didn't do it this year, but when I'm having a party like once a year.	CHITCHAT
Somebody else will accumulate and then.	CHITCHAT
Be there until next year usually.	CHITCHAT
And sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Make myself like Tronic.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Other things like that, but not 12.	CHITCHAT
Oh drink more and I was going on about Apple.	CHITCHAT
Yeah maybe I shouldn't do that.	CHITCHAT
And drink it.	CHITCHAT
It's just.	CHITCHAT
It's useless.	CHITCHAT
I'm not happy with his hand, she's here, but I don't know what's the problem with the problem is it's likely.	CHITCHAT
At least you read she no time travel to another part of trail and Trig Island.	CHITCHAT
Don't drink and drive.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's that's for sure.	CHITCHAT
I mean, if you have to drink in here, not out, you can drink something obviously about.	CHITCHAT
Not driving.	CHITCHAT
I'm not the one who's going to tell you to never drink anything.	CHITCHAT
Have fun.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, I think I'm going to get rid of that and keep it us.	CHITCHAT
Some most between his fingers.	CHITCHAT
Looks better.	CHITCHAT

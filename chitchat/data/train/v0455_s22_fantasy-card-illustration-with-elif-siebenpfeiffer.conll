Way to start on the background 'cause.	O
A lot more blurry and undefined then I wanted to be.	O
But you gotta start somewhere right?	O
And just trying to.	O
To get all the values and rough shapes to where I like them before.	O
Painting in a few more details for single trees.	O
But I think I'm going to keep continuing with that after the stream is done.	O
Poop, poop, poop.	CHITCHAT
And of course I'm trying to get to keep a few.	O
Enter trees tree crowns on the background so.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
But I might.	O
Actually, go ahead and replace those with cloud things going on there.	O
I know it does need to actually be recognisable's son.	O
Something special just.	O
Working in the few more values to give it a bit more direction, man.	O
Keep the lightest area nearer to the tree guy.	O
Then to the.	O
Total absolute up.	O
Yeah, this is this.	O
Alright, i'ma just go ahead and.	O
Give it all a bit of a shift towards.	O
More greenish colors again.	O
But just loved it.	O
Just so we have a more consistent color scheme.	O
And now.	O
I can start with shaping this Bush too.	O
Because it's just a single blob at this find, and that's not good.	O
Thank you.	O
Yes, Jen is a nice one.	O
He's got a bit of a penas shin going on for himself change much and I don't know bout tenazas shins.	O
I have an idea.	O
I wanted to try out quickly, which is to add a few.	O
Quick.	O
No.	O
Apple trees?	O
Find something like that.	O
Spell alright, I'm at the top.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
At which I'm talking.	O
So quietly that I don't even understand myself, which I should change.	O
I'm just trying, I'm just.	O
Experimenting until the brush does what I wanted to do until I'm happy with what it is.	O
That's the beauty with like texture brushes like that you can just let them do their thing until you're happy.	O
Nobody's.	CHITCHAT
Nobody's asking about how you came to.	O
So choose.	O

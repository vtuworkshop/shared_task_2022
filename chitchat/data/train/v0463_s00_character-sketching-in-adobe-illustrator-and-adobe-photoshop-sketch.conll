Alright, I think were back.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully it'll be us will stick with us this time.	CHITCHAT
Will send out one more tweets.	CHITCHAT
Updating Twitter and then we will get started.	CHITCHAT
Late, but.	CHITCHAT
Try to make up for it.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So a little unfortunate, but I think we are now good to go.	CHITCHAT
We got music playing, I think.	CHITCHAT
Just check my audio settings.	CHITCHAT
It's looking pretty good.	CHITCHAT
There we go, get some audio, go in.	CHITCHAT
For streaming.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Cool, so tonight we're going to start off the week.	O
Nice and easy.	O
If you joined me last week we worked on a whole bunch of different things.	O
Worked on some typefaces in illustrator using an extension called font self.	O
Later on in the week worked on some vector illustration with some of my characters and then brought that into cinema 4D.	O
We may do that again this week and get a little deeper into that 3D process, but I thought I would start out.	O
In Adobe Photoshop sketch.	O
So I got my iPad up here.	O
I'm going to show you a little bit of how I go about sketching out my ideas for the mandalas that I create for my characters.	O
And hopefully oh BS will stick with me as we do this.	O
But if you are just joining, thank you so much.	O
Happy Monday.	CHITCHAT
Please say hi in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to hear from you.	CHITCHAT
And let's keep each other company while we're hanging out.	CHITCHAT
If you have questions, please ask.	CHITCHAT
If you have ideas for what I'm working on.	CHITCHAT
Also love to hear them most of the time when I'm working on these characters, I'm starting out with with nothing, nothing in my head and just drawing whatever comes out.	CHITCHAT
It's a good outlet.	CHITCHAT
I would encourage you to do the same if you want to follow along and sketch while I'm sketching.	CHITCHAT
That would be awesome, but without further ado.	CHITCHAT
Going to get started.	CHITCHAT
I am using Adobe Photoshop sketch which is a deprecated Adobe app.	O
It is still available, but they are no longer updating it.	O
It has been replaced with Adobe fresco.	O
I'll show you why I haven't fully migrated over to fresco just yet.	O
As we get started, but.	O
I really loves Adobe Photoshop sketch.	O
This was the tool that really took me from carrying around a paper notebook and pencils and erasers to being able to go fully digital on my iPad, which has been my dream since I first saw the iPad so.	O
I think the reason for this was.	O
I love A to work in a lot of detail on my sketches when I'm working on characters I use a lot of geometric shapes and so having tools to quickly create shapes is really valuable and also just having that feel of working with a pencil and paper without having to carry that notebook is awesome and so the graphite pencil in Adobe Photoshop Sketch, which is the same as fresco is is a wonder to me an I love it.	O
The Animal Crossing project that some of you may have seen.	O
Earlier when I first started streaming a few weeks ago, actually started out on the iPad.	O
I spent a weekend just doing some sketches like this, quickly sketching out faces of the different characters before then going and bringing them into illustrator to turn into vectors.	O

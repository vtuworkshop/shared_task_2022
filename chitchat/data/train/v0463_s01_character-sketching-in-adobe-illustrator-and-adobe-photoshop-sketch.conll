So yeah, so there's a lot of fun things there.	O
But yeah, I worked on a bunch of things.	O
I've done a little bit of lettering.	O
In Adobe Photoshop sketch, this is where my bubble fonts first started, which I'm going to pick back up on and turn into a much cleaner font pretty soon.	O
Tagging done some figure drawing.	O
I went to class in actually like a sketching meet up.	O
In a town nearby and did some sketching a couple years ago, would love to get back into doing some of that again.	O
That was a lot of Fun.	O
Haven't done that really since high school so it was good to get into, but for the most part I'm using this too rough out my character ideas?	O
Let's jump into that project.	O
And we will dive into.	O
Some sketches, so the vector illustration we did last week came from this sketch, which is the same thing that we then brought into.	O
Into cinema 40 and converted into a 3D character, an actually if I bring up be hands.	O
You can see the results right here, so this is the we went from this sketch.	O
Into this 3D render, which was super fun to work on, and I'd like to do some more of that on this stream and also just kind of share my learning experience with cinema 40.	O
Obviously this is just flat 3D objects that I'm stacking on top of each other, so it's pretty basic, but it doesn't fit my style really well, so I've been pretty pleased with that so far.	O
But I started to sketch a little bit earlier.	O
This morning and I thought we would pick that back up.	O
Let's close this sketch.	O
And jump into.	O
This one that I've been working on, so again, I said I really like Adobe Photoshop sketch because of its shape tools.	O
You can see that even in just working through rough ideas and sketches just how clean I can get all of my lines and different forms.	O
And that's through the shape tools in.	O
So we Photoshop sketch and essentially they work as guides, so I have this circle on the screen right now if I want to, say, draw a circle behind this character, I can simply trace around it.	O
And just as if I put a Cup on the page and run around it with a pencil, I can get that.	O
That outline of the shape with the pencil tool that I'm using and told this is coming to Adobe fresco as soon as it does I will make a full leap over into that tool, but until then sticking with Adobe Photoshop sketch and.	O
Sticking with the original.	O
So what I want to do is pick up this character.	O
There's a few things that I want to do with this, so I want to add a little more details, some more creatures and monsters into it, and there are two, two, or three different projects they want to tackle this week with this character and resulting illustration that will come up with.	O
The One I'd like to do another 3D rendering in cinema 40, but later on this week looking at the schedule.	O
Actually this weekend I plan to do a couple of streams that will show a little bit more of the work I do that is non digital or at least starts digital and moves into the non digital and that will be in using the glow forge which is a like a laser cutter that can cut wood and acrylic all sorts of different materials to make an actual physical mask.	O
It will probably create out of acrylic.	O
Will also use the cricket paper cutter, which I can also cut vinyl to create stickers that will put on top of that acrylic and so will go through that process with this design on streams that will happen this weekend.	O
So I'm I'm pretty excited for that.	O
So what I have so far I've got this little guy.	O
Sticking it with his tongue stuck out.	O
There's this kind of Monster.	O
Kind of looming behind him there, a couple of trees there.	O
I'd like to incorporate some more plants, maybe some birds or fish around in this world.	O
Set my characters live in this.	O
No real differentiation between animals that fly versus animals that swim.	O
They can pretty much go wherever they want, so will sketch some of those in there.	O

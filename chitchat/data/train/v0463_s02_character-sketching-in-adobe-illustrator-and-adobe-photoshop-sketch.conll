And we'll just show you how some of these pieces will look before we incorporate them.	O
So this is the sort of thing I'm going for.	O
A little more detail in this piece.	O
There were some little dogs here at the bottom that came into play, as well as some more people and things on the top, so I want to do that with the sketch that we're going to do now.	O
My process for creating these is really really simple, and so one of the reasons I also love the simplicity of a tool like Adobe Photoshop sketch, and really, what fresco has become as well.	O
There's no symmetry tool in this.	O
This is basically just drawing tools and layers, and so because there's a lot of symmetry that comes into my work, the very first thing I do when I started project is to create a layer with a red vertical line and that's essentially the center point.	O
For my drawing and I will mirror things manually back and forth by copying layers and then just flipping them, putting them into the right place.	O
So really, really simple, but pretty much everything I do starts with that line and then I just start sketching and see what comes out.	O
Usually starts with an eye, so whether it's a character I like this or one of these more slightly more detailed monster eyes.	O
But I'm going to get going here with this and start adding some more.	O
Some more incidents I think maybe will create.	O
Maybe a fish?	O
That we can work into this piece.	O
I also usually don't have a great idea for layout unless I'm making something very specific, and so I will.	O
I'll tend to create characters and then move them around a piece until I find a spot that I really like.	O
Chris Leon, thank you so much for joining tonight.	CHITCHAT
Leon says.	CHITCHAT
Need symmetry now please Adobe.	CHITCHAT
I agreed Leon, the sooner we can get symmetry the better.	O
I know at least not in Adobe Photoshop sketch, but in illustrator there are some illustrator on desktop.	O
There are some plugins that allow you to do symmetry.	O
I should probably purchase those plugins, start using them, but I haven't in the past.	O
So I I do all of that manually and probably take a lot of extra time that I don't need to.	O
But I'm working on these pieces, but.	O
Anyway, maybe will do that for this tonight I'll finally splurge and get that plugin, but if you've seen any of the demos for illustrator on iPad that is coming out is super exciting.	O
There are mirroring tools there.	O
There a grid tools.	O
They have all changed my workflow of creating vector art on the iPad as soon as we're allowed to start streaming some of that I will absolutely do that and share because it really does make what I do a lot faster.	O
Leon says in the chat.	CHITCHAT
It's all hacks and smash right now for both of us totaly.	CHITCHAT
I look forward to this glorious future where we don't have to do that anymore.	CHITCHAT
It will be good times.	CHITCHAT
Good times indeed.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Chris Leon, I hope you're both having great nights.	CHITCHAT
I had a bit of a rocky start.	CHITCHAT
This evening with getting OBS up and running was not really playing really working for me.	CHITCHAT
But we seem to be OK now.	CHITCHAT
Of course they said that him my music stopped abruptly, so maybe I shouldn't say that anymore.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so first I'm just going to try and get an idea of.	O
A fish shaped that I might want an aisle.	O
Get a little more detail in Christmas and afterwards.	O
This is still a little.	O
Little rougher than I'd like it.	O
For this, I think these fish are going to be dead, so we're going to give them the.	O
International symbol of the dead character, which is just to give it an X for its I.	O
I'd like to use hearts.	O
For the lips.	O
So I'm going to give him a heart left here.	O

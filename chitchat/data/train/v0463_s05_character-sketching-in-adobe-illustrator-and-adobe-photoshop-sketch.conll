For Camden, If you mean.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Being able to emulate the.	CHITCHAT
The same way that someone else draws.	CHITCHAT
I think if that's something you really want to do, if that's the way that you learn, or you just really love that style and you want to use it, I think the best way is.	CHITCHAT
Is to spend time just studying their work.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Doing it alot like get references that they work on the screen.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just kind of immerse yourself.	CHITCHAT
I guess in in the things that they've created.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure that I would do that for outside of just personal work as a learning tool.	CHITCHAT
I think it's always best to, if you're inspired by someone and you love what they do, is to try and find a way to adopt that style and make it your own.	CHITCHAT
But I think you know, learning someone elses style.	CHITCHAT
The best thing is just too.	CHITCHAT
If you can watch them work and really like, just spend time with the things that they create.	CHITCHAT
Their are illustrators and character designers that I follow on social media that I follow on the hands and.	CHITCHAT
I don't just kind of scroll through and give an appreciation of an I like really like the study like what they've created and then think about the decisions behind the things that they've created.	CHITCHAT
Because you learn a lot that way, so I hope that answers your question.	CHITCHAT
If I didn't, maybe you can reframe it a little bit, but.	CHITCHAT
As with anything else, I think it's just practice and just draw as much as you can.	CHITCHAT
If there's a style you love.	CHITCHAT
Try doing a little bit of it every day.	CHITCHAT
That was something that that I did.	CHITCHAT
Earlier on, I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if it's if I have any of them in here before I got into.	CHITCHAT
The current style that I'm using.	CHITCHAT
I was doing these character sketch a day projects.	CHITCHAT
And so these aren't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how old these are now, but essentially I was trying to jump into.	CHITCHAT
Illustrator, I'm sorry into this app into Photoshop.	CHITCHAT
Sketch every single day and spend at least 15 to 20 minutes sketching something again usually didn't have an idea, would just sketch whatever came to mind.	CHITCHAT
Was playing with the Nintendo switch one day and so I sketched this, but you can kind of see like these earlier sketches that I did.	CHITCHAT
They definitely have a pretty strong Adventure Time influence like you could easily imagine some of these things in Adventure Time.	CHITCHAT
And I would hear that constantly, like Oh, your style is just it's Adventure Time like that's what I see when I when I see your work.	CHITCHAT
And while that's flattering because I love Adventure Time and the artist who created it.	CHITCHAT
I also wanted to continue to push myself to create something that was more mine and so overtime while I still do really love a lot of these little creatures and characters, especially in this little Huggy one.	CHITCHAT
I started thinking about the elements of the work that I really loved and.	CHITCHAT
As I continue to work, let's Scroll down here.	CHITCHAT
I started experimenting a little bit more and I still wanted really simplistic characters like this that I had been drawing.	CHITCHAT
But to try and discover something about those that could become uniquely my own, and that led me to start experimenting more with shapes and straight lines like going really geometric in my style, still maintains this kind of cartoony look, but began to evolve into something that was more my own.	CHITCHAT
You can still see early on while I was starting to work with symmetry.	CHITCHAT
Still kind of has a bit of an Adventure Time feel to it, like the little rounded teeth.	CHITCHAT
On these characters still feels like it could be from that show, but it started to take on a little bit more of my own style.	CHITCHAT
And so this evolution began.	CHITCHAT
So still, really, really cartoony.	CHITCHAT
Did a couple of like wiki, mickey's that were more geometric.	CHITCHAT
Still kind of like sticking with that real Adventure Time feel.	CHITCHAT
But then all of a sudden, one day I found this.	CHITCHAT
I shape that I really liked.	CHITCHAT
It actually looks like it did start with this little guy.	CHITCHAT
Kind of big big guys with really large pupils.	CHITCHAT
Love that started evolving.	CHITCHAT
That ended up making some rough character sketches of stranger things characters.	CHITCHAT
Which evolved into this little this little piece, which was kind of fun to make work done.	CHITCHAT

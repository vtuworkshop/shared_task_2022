Some goonies really starting to think about.	CHITCHAT
Like How do I start making a style that is that is more mine and less Adventure Time.	CHITCHAT
This still though, was kind of leaning in that way.	CHITCHAT
But as time went on, I started using simpler and simpler shapes and so you can start to see like circles and straighter lines.	CHITCHAT
These stars and hearts start to evolve in in some of this work, and if I jump to some of the newer ones.	CHITCHAT
Bringing in a lot more symmetry.	CHITCHAT
And again, just like really dominant geometric shapes and really started moving away from that Adventure Time style, it was all evolving into this and so now when I look at more recent work.	CHITCHAT
It's been it's been more about experimentation of shape and form in creating just really weird things.	CHITCHAT
That are using basic geometric shapes and I feel like I'm as with all of us still very much evolving my style, but I'm in a place where I'm really pleased with the things that I see in that I'm creating and it all started with a love, a van in emulation of Adventure Time.	CHITCHAT
So again, I think it's fine to look to emulate a style or learn it, but keep pushing yourself and see how you can evolve that and make it something that is truly yours.	CHITCHAT
It's.	CHITCHAT
It's a great feeling to have that and be able to do that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to.	O
Add a few more things into this.	O
Again, we want to make this a little more detailed like.	O
Peace, kind of like this.	O
So this one we had a kind of roughed in a bird a little bit later on up top here, but we had some plants and fish here at the bottom.	O
Some birds I want to get a little bit of that kind of rolling into.	O
Into this piece before we move into.	O
Illustrated of vector it all up.	O
Going to merge some of these layers.	O
All right?	O
Let's Bring in.	O
Animal Some form, so I'm gonna just start my animal off with the rectangle.	O
And then I'm going to add.	O
Circle into that.	O
Just to round off the edges.	O
Again, acknowledging that this could be much simpler.	O
If I was to go right into illustrator or use other tools that maybe would give me a rounded rectangle, but I really kind of enjoy this process.	O
It feels much more like what I would have to do if I was working.	O
With pencil and paper.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It also helps me think about how I may re create a character or set of shapes once I get into illustrator so the vector process is usually pretty quick.	O
Once I get in there.	O
Alright, so.	O
See.	O
This character.	O
Probably do some like.	O
Around it legs.	O
That There.	O
Possibly person.	O
Alright, we'll leave.	O
That is one.	O
One idea.	O
Another idea that I had was something that maybe has.	O
Shrunk Over here.	O
You have a little bit of breathing room.	O

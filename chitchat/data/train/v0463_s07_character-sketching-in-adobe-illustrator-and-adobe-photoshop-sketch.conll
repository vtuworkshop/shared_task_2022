Another thought, now let's see here what is.	O
Start with.	O
So at this point, what I'm essentially doing?	O
It's just looking for ideas that may or may not become characters.	O
A lot of times the little blue sketches I do will find their way into other pieces.	O
But it's a way of kind of working out what what might work in a piece.	O
what I might want to bring in.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I am thinking.	O
That may be out of this tree.	O
Have Plant come up will do some kind of a plant peace.	O
Duplicate that.	O
All right, and then I want to reference back.	O
There's a couple of pieces that I've thought about bringing over into this one, so I have.	O
This piece Which I think might be interesting to make a part of this new one.	O
Let's go ahead and save this as an image.	O
In fact, we can also.	O
Add an image layer.	O
Choose that recent image.	O
And just send it to the back.	O
Think about.	O
There.	O
If you have a little bit of Chaos, Chaos is fine.	O
Let's take.	O
This piece and this piece will save the original and duplicate it.	O
Shrink this down.	O
Yeah, there's something something in here that that should us might work.	O
So what I'm going to do is, I think I'm actually going to rather than going forward finished piece here.	O
Think I'm actually going to separate these two.	O
Turn this off.	O
Turn this one back on.	O
Turn this off.	O
I'm going to export this.	O
It's an image.	O
And then we're going to switch over into illustrator.	O
I want to get this piece.	O
Turned into vector.	O
And just think a little bit more about what that what that finish pace will be.	O
So one of the things that you can do in.	O
From Adobe sketch to get what you've just worked on in sketch into illustrator.	O
If you bring up the share sheet and choose open in Adobe apps, you can choose illustrator.	O
95% of the time this works.	O
I'm going to give it a minute here.	O
You can kind of see little progress.	O
Progress bar is spinning.	O
It was sense.	O
Let's see if we get it.	O
Watching watching.	CHITCHAT
Something's happening.	CHITCHAT
Waiting, waiting.	CHITCHAT
Right that.	O

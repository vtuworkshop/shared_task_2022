Definitely didn't work.	CHITCHAT
That's always did it.	CHITCHAT
No, it did not work, so will just grab these images.	O
I'm going to.	O
Create an image.	O
Send it to my Mac book pro.	O
Alright, so we got that one script, the other one.	O
Prep the image.	O
Since that to my Mac book pro.	O
Beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now let's switch over to.	O
Our main our regular scene.	O
An bring up.	O
Still be illustrator.	O
Which is for some reason not showing up.	O
So many problems tonight.	O
Here we go.	O
Alright, so switched over into illustrator.	O
Get the iPad out of the way.	O
And we'll just quit out of.	O
Reflector up so that we can focus in on illustrator.	O
So first thing I'm going to do.	O
Is take those two images that I just exported to the computer and bring them in.	O
Show my illustrator file.	O
And just drop him on the screen.	O
I don't really care too much at this point about canvas size.	O
This is a 30 by 30 inch.	O
Canvas.	O
Which is probably a little bigger than I need, but.	O
It's fine.	O
My keyboard said.	O
So many problems.	O
All right?	O
Let's start with.	O
Which one do you want it?	O
Begin with.	O
Start with this guy.	O
Unhappy with where he is so far?	O
So I'm going to lock, actually, first we will drop the opacity down to about 45%.	O
Plug in this keyboard.	O
Motor void says amazing how you should.	CHITCHAT
Lovely piece is evolving.	CHITCHAT
Still crafting digital days demands practice though it is easier to have all the style.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it it definitely is.	CHITCHAT
I and again one of the reasons I really love.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Having this digital sketchbook is I didn't have to go and dig into, you know, a sketchbook that is.	CHITCHAT
Four years old.	CHITCHAT
Go and find it in a bookcase.	CHITCHAT
It's all there on the.	CHITCHAT
So there on my.	CHITCHAT
On my iPad that can carry around, I can look back and reflect on those things, which is pretty great.	CHITCHAT
I love it and it is kind of fun to see how that style evolves.	CHITCHAT
Overtime, it's.	CHITCHAT
Just shows what goes into the things that we created.	CHITCHAT
Just looking for.	O
The USB C cable profound.	O
So plug this in.	O
This PC slot.	O
I am running in mechanical keyboard that is wireless and has just died.	O
So.	O
Introducing new problems and see what I'm doing, but that's fine.	O
You can make do.	O
Maybe a smarter way to do this?	O
Bluetooth on.	O
Put this in.	O
Make sure that we're on the right computer.	O
Alright cool, we're back in business with the keyboard.	O
Got the basics right, so I've dropped the opacity down.	O
For this sketch, and then I'm also going to set it to.	O
Change its blend mode to multiply.	O
And then I can leave this as the topmost layer on my piece, and I'll be doing my sketch.	O

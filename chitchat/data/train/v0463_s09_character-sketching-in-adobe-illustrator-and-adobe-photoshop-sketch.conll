Underneath it, so let's lock that layer and create a new one.	O
And I'm going to zoom in.	O
This little guy to start out.	O
Will start building.	O
Building this character and while we're working on it, I'm going to change my stroke color.	O
To read.	O
Just so that we can see it a little bit easier.	O
Maybe set that thickness 2 three pixels.	O
That way, on the stream you'll be able to see what we got going.	O
To start with the eyes.	O
And you'll quickly see why.	O
And mirroring tool would be amazing for me.	O
So I'm going to just center this together an group the eyes.	O
And then I'm going to copy them.	O
And drag copy over for the 2nd I.	O
And then I'm going to group those altogether.	O
Next, I'll choose the Polygon tool.	O
Set it to a 3 sided polygons that I get a triangle.	O
And grab a nose.	O
Next I want to create the lips.	O
Round this.	O
And we could copy of it.	O
Now, because I intend to.	O
Potentially make a physical object out of this on the glow forge later this week.	O
I'm going to try and keep everything in this illustration broken out into shape, so I won't rely on a stroke thickness like I could have made those lips out of just a single stroke, but that doesn't translate really well into the paper cutting or the laser cutting tools that we're going to use, and so having having everything just be shapes is is much easier, so I'm going to stick with that.	O
Or for these things, I'm going to zoom in to get.	O
But better sense of these.	O
Of the size of the two, I'm also going to make sure that their centered.	O
And when I feel relatively good about that, I'll group them.	O
And now I have a group of the eyes.	O
The nose in the lips.	O
I can select the mall and centered those together.	O
And you'll see that as I go like, I'm just constantly grouping things, centering them, making sure everything lines up.	O
Again, probably not the best way to work, but it works for me and I get I am getting work that I like out of it.	O
Alright, so let's make this tongue.	O
And we will.	O
Using the direct select tool, I'm going to select the bottom most points and then use the rounding.	O
Features around those corners off.	O
Also.	O
YouTube.	O
A little here.	O
Drop this down just a little bit more.	O
We go.	O
OK, these strokes are, I think, a little thicker that I'm going to want to work with, so I'm going to drop him to two.	O
That feels a little better.	O
Less overwhelming.	O
OK, so now I want to put these drops into.	O
Into the tongue.	O
For this, like.	O
Show me something.	O
So again, I'm just going to select the two top most.	O
Points and round them.	O
And then.	O
I'll make some copies of them.	O
Make sure I get the full shades there.	O
Is this thing I want to do is make sure that snap to point is turned on?	O
Want to try to line these up?	O

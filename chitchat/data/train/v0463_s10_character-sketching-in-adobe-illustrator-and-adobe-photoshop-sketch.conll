Cool.	CHITCHAT
This one.	O
Snap it's at this point.	O
That is not not drag.	O
It looked at.	O
There we go.	O
Select these points.	O
This one.	O
I made them a little less.	O
Why did I needed them?	O
Groupm Just make sure that they aligned to the left side of tongue and then I'll take this group.	O
Will just make it bigger.	O
Better OK cool.	O
So now I can.	O
Get the.	O
Get this design.	O
This like slime that is covering his tongue.	O
Get it all worked out.	O
Hold this one up.	O
Then I'm going to take this one and I'm going to just flip it vertically.	O
Because this one we're going to use just to punch in.	O
And the same thing for this one.	O
This vertically.	O
Something like that.	O
And.	O
To help with this much Lee.	O
Also, going to just use a rectangle.	O
Going to join using the Pathfinder tool.	O
I'll use the United Shape mode to connects.	O
The two drips with rounded edges at the top.	O
And then I'll take the two that it's pointing down and bring them to the top.	O
I'll select the first one and then not larger shape.	O
I've created an use the minus front shape mode to punch into that.	O
And again, repeat that using the minus Friendship Mode, and I've got my little drip.	O
Now, if I make a copy of the tongue and select that new shape I've used, I'll use the intersect shape mode, which will give me that coding on the tip of my characters tongue.	O
Having done that, all group them.	O
And then I'm going to select all of those mouthpieces.	O
Again, center them in Group them, and then also like the face.	O
Make sure it's centered and then group that piece.	O
Next I'm going to work on the face shape.	O
Face shape is made from a series of.	O
Ellipses.	O
It's funny, I really love using the pen.	O
The pen tool to create work, but I do find that a lot of the character work that I've been doing for myself.	O
This personal work ends up just being simple shapes and.	O
You know, seeing how it can break them apart to create interesting.	O
Interesting arrangements, I think that's actually how these characters were born is just.	O
Playing with shape.	O
So this one needs to be a little wider.	O
So that it can connect.	O
Connect about here.	O
And then I will.	O
Select this circle again.	O
They could copy of it, zoom out so we can see it.	O
The flip it horizontally.	O
And drag it into position.	O
And then I'll make a copy or a rather not make a copy.	O
I will Unite those two shapes in the Pathfinder.	O
And select the face and that face those sets of ellipses and just center them.	O
Then I'm going to select them again and I'm going to use the divide.	O
Pathfinder tool.	O
When I've done that, but I get are a series of shapes.	O
This topmost piece I don't need so I can delete it.	O
And I'm left with these two large shapes.	O
I can then copy them.	O
Actually will just jump out of this group.	O
Let's just select those two shapes together, hit Unite.	O
And there is my face shape so I can send that to the back.	O
And censor everything in Group the face.	O

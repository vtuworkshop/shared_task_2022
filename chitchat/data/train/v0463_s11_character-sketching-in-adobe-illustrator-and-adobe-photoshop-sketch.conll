So there is our face piece complete going to move on to the body.	O
Send it to the back.	O
Looks like.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Back in the right mode so.	O
Again, I'm going to select the two top most points and.	O
Then use the corner tool.	O
Drive that so that it's rounded and then I have the body of my character.	O
For these kind of sleevi cuff pieces, I'm going to go a little rougher.	O
Do it just like that.	O
And then, because again, I want to keep these nice and clean for when I.	O
For when I moved to the paper cutter and the laser cutter in a couple of days.	O
For that stream, I'm going to keep these shapes nice and clean.	O
Not a lot of overlap.	O
Alright, let's.	CHITCHAT
Create the sleeve.	O
Sleep can actually come.	O
To hear	O
And that is just going to go.	O
To the back.	O
Route those two.	O
All right, so the next piece is this kind of windy windy arm.	O
And I used to.	O
Really fret about the right way to do this until I really thought through like what would the simplest way be to create?	O
These shapes, how would I do that?	O
If it was, you know, one of these face shapes and.	O
I finally.	CHITCHAT
Finally figured it out one day, which is to not worry about creating the curves.	O
Right away.	CHITCHAT
Just.	CHITCHAT
Create straight lines that are going to mimic the curves that we want.	O
As I'm doing here and they don't have to be perfect to my sketch close enough.	O
And with this one over just a little though.	O
OK, so now I have a rectangular line that is following the curves that I sketched out.	O
The next thing that I'm going to do is select it and then I'm going to.	O
Alright, you first first let's get a thicker stroke.	O
Probably want to go to about 50 pixels.	O
And then I'm going to switch from the.	O
From the selection tool to the direct selection tool, so I'll hit a on my keyboard to select that and you'll see that there are all those little circles.	O
Which show me that I have access to the corner tool, so if I just pull this.	O
And go for rounded corners instantly.	O
I get that rounded.	O
Uh, instead of rounded strokes and I can see now that I can actually make this stroke a little thinner to better match my.	O
My original sketch.	O
I'm going to pull these again just to make sure that they are.	O
As round as they can be.	O
So now I have a rounded stroke that is really mimicking.	O
The sketch that I did originally, which is fantastic.	O
The next thing that I want to do though, is to convert this from being a stroke to a shape, and so the way to do that is to go to object.	O
Path outline stroke.	O
And you'll see then that what I have.	O
We ungroup, it is.	O
A stroke that is left behind, which I no longer want, so we're going to delete that, but I'm left with the shape.	O
And I can swap the outline there, so we're just looking at the stroke.	O
Let's make the Phil White.	O
Consistency, and then we'll move that back into position.	O
That MOT says inside out of the box, yes.	O
All right here, I'm going to make a copy of the sleeve.	O
And then just cut out that extra little piece of the arm.	O
Then we can move up top here to create this little glove.	O
So I'm going to start with a rectangle.	O
And then similar to what we did with that, like kind of GUI tongue.	O
We're going to.	CHITCHAT
Create a rounded.	O
Rectangle here looks like I'll probably want to see little smaller.	O

So I'm going to make copies of these.	O
So just like before, I'm just going to drag those copies.	O
Make sure that they snap so they're all connected nicely.	O
And group them, and then I'll shrink them down.	O
So that they are the same width as the glove.	O
Looks like that can go just a little more.	O
Surprise.	O
So then.	O
I'm going to just Unite all of these.	O
And let's see, what if I want to my left was here.	O
Group.	O
It didn't Unite quite the way I wanted, so I'm going to.	O
Redo that.	O
That is because.	O
This.	O
Shape did not snap.	O
Go.	O
Much better, so let's group these again.	O
Bounding box back on so we can see what we're doing.	O
Much better, OK, so now I'm going to select those.	O
And using the shape mode Unite, just going to bring those together.	O
For now I'm going to just leave this little bumps these.	O
Lions I will probably do differently.	O
So that they will begin convert from being a stroke too.	O
The shape.	O
So do I.	CHITCHAT
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Let's leave it.	O
There is a line for now, and I'll decide later how wanna do that.	O
OK, so then last thing I need to do is create a little thumb.	O
Again, using directs the direct select tool.	O
I'll just around that corner.	O
And then I'm going to use the Unite shape mode to join those together.	O
Going to make a copy of that glove and use it to cut out that extra little piece arm.	O
So there's our arm.	O
I'm going to group it now because the next step will be for me too.	O
Copy over and flip the arm so will go to transform.	O
Flip horizontal.	O
And then.	O
Not like that.	O
Alright, so now I just want to drag.	O
This arm into place.	O
Is about right.	O
So now I'm going to group those arms.	O
And then we can.	O
Not like that.	O
Let's make sure we could group the right things.	O
Select the whole peace and center it, and so we are interested.	O
Good spot, good reminder that I have not yet saved this file.	O
Let's drop it into the spearheads folder.	O
And we'll call this.	CHITCHAT
What are we going to call this?	O
Call this Globo.	O
I don't have.	CHITCHAT
Forehead here tonight to get me a good.	CHITCHAT
Give me a good character name.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we'll just say that.	CHITCHAT
Let's make these legs.	O
For our friends.	O
And the way that I'm going to make his legs is to start with a rectangle.	O

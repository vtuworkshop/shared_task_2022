And then at long last will use the pencil tool or the pencil to create a curve.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Connect up Get that basic shape down.	O
Then I can select both and make sure that they align on the bottom.	O
Seriously?	CHITCHAT
Bottom line.	O
And then I'll just select those two shapes and using the Pathfinder Unite them.	O
Looking pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Can you use the ellipse to put these little?	CHITCHAT
Circles on his shoes kind of mark his ankles.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much.	CHITCHAT
Even from back when I was doing those character sketch a day, if you go back and look at some of those older ones.	CHITCHAT
Like on my Instagram, I think they're all still in there.	CHITCHAT
If you go way, way back.	CHITCHAT
Always put the little circle like logo, Converse, logo, spot on on shoes.	CHITCHAT
I can't get away from that.	CHITCHAT
It's just not.	CHITCHAT
It's not a pair of shoes until it has converse logo on it.	CHITCHAT
OK, so that's one leg.	O
The other thing that I'm going to do?	O
Is manually make these stripes in the legs?	O
Make sure that they are the right width.	O
And again, the reason that I'm going to keep the manual is that.	O
When I in fact, let's do it like this, you get the right width when I eventually.	O
Move to the cricket and the glow forge to do.	O
The laser cutting paper cutting vinyl cutting that will do this weekends.	O
I want the shapes.	O
Should be as exact as possible.	O
Going to make a few copies of these to get the stripes on his legs.	O
One more.	O
So select those.	O
And then in the.	O

Distribute their web Seligman and group them.	O
And then I can group the whole leg.	O
Copy it.	O

And then you guessed it and select my character and.	O
No.	O
Select the legs.	O

Select everything.	O
And center it, and then I'll group that.	O
That's the first main character completed.	O

He also might be kind of fun to animate, so maybe will do.	O
Little bit of after effects work in another stream coming up.	O
OK.	O
Let's creates.	O
This kind of big, ominous character behind.	O
He is going to be created with for the main body shape.	O
A couple of rectangles.	O
Going to align him too.	O
Bottom characters feet.	O

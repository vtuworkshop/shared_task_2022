There we go.	O
Lost that some bounding box again.	O
Alright, so let's just get these back up into place.	O
So I want around these corners.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Something goofy happening with my illustrator right now.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Got it back.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we've selected those top two corners.	O
I'm going around them.	O
Let's make sure that everything is centered.	O
Back up to our sketch.	O
Great.	O
Cool that works will create another rectangle now for the head.	O
Select that larger body and center it.	O
And then using the Unite shape mode connect the two.	O
For single, do select the top most points and again use those.	O
Corners to create a rounded.	O
And then I'm going to create or select these next two points at the base of the head, and then I'm going to drag it out to create the rounding in the opposite.	O
Order Devon, in chats welcome, does it?	CHITCHAT
Devin says what you're from Connecticut, Awesome, Devin.	CHITCHAT
I am from Connecticut.	CHITCHAT
Are you 2 from Connecticut?	CHITCHAT
All right, we're going to send that big, ominous body to the back.	O
And now I wanna create this I.	O
So again, as with everything that I'm working on, we're going to use the simplest shapes that we can.	O
I like to create the eye shapes from ellipsis.	O
So we get about the shape that I want.	O
Once it got it amid copy of it.	O
I'll drag another one up.	O
So you get the bottom shape, then I'll select those two ellipses and use the intersect shape mode to get that.	O
Bible shape let me copy of it.	O
In shrink it down.	O
Then I'm actually going to just nudge it a little.	O
Picking up the.	O
Top and bottom of the eyelids.	O
Will select those two and center them vertically as well as horizontally.	O
Group them and then we can create the iris in the pupil.	O
Like that?	O
Just a little bigger.	O
The work that I'm going to make a copy of that large.	O
Iris to make a pupil.	O
Like that so then will select those two in Group them.	O
Add into the larger I.	O
Can you use a star tool?	O
Thanks to create our.	O
Eyelashes Making sure that I've got enough.	O
I make.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Mute.	CHITCHAT
I think an 8 sided star here.	O

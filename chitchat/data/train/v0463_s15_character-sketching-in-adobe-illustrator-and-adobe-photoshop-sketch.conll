Yep, that's right cool.	CHITCHAT
OK so will rotate this a little.	O
Bigger.	O
So probably wanted to also affect the radius.	O
Opposite to what I wanted.	O
Earth don't like it?	O
OK, we're going to go with a really simple way.	O
Let's start here.	O
This will be faster than.	O
Playing around with.	O
That so I'm going to make a copy.	O
Of that line I just drew.	O
Flip it horizontally.	O
Zoom in.	O
Want to get these two pieces to just snap?	O
So the connect and then.	O
And then join them.	O
So I get one complete shape.	O
Then I'm going to take that.	O
Richard bounding boxes back on.	O
Center the eyelashes with the eye.	O
Go into that I group and grab the outer.	O
Outer eyelid peace.	O
And I'm going to use that to cut into the lashes.	O
Using the minus front tool.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Should we think?	CHITCHAT
That was weird.	CHITCHAT
Look at that, that's super weird.	CHITCHAT
Little visual glitch in illustrator.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's zoom back out.	O
We got the eye for this monster.	O
Looming behind our hero.	O
So let's go ahead and Center.	O
All of those pieces.	O
We're going to make his mouth.	O
Whoa.	CHITCHAT
Unintended.	CHITCHAT
Unintended scrolling sub band of my existence.	O
Alright, so for this I'm going to do a couple of things.	O
The first thing to do is cut.	O
Actually will make two circles will be faster, so will create a second ellipse, and I'm going to.	O
Make it smaller.	O
Like that?	O
And then I'll create a rectangle.	O
When you start to cut into the ellipsis.	O
So select the other one.	O
Minus fronts.	O
Send that backwards.	O
That we can see the topmost ellipse, select that one in the other rectangle.	O
Choose minus front.	O
And then I have the top part of the mouth.	O
Which is great.	O
So now I'm going to do the bottom part.	O
So Excel.	O
Going to grab the bottom two corners.	O
Around them.	O
Look at the bottom part of the loop.	O
That looks.	O
That were on it.	O
Those and then it will center.	O
And group these, we just need some triangles for the teeth, so I'll grab the Polygon tool.	O
And create a 3 sided Polygon.	O
So Devon and checking out your profile here on be hence.	CHITCHAT
First of all, your work is really cool.	CHITCHAT
I love the laser native album art that you created.	CHITCHAT

It looks like you are in San Francisco, so now I'm curious about your.	CHITCHAT
Connection to Connecticut.	CHITCHAT
I've actually been living in Connecticut now for the past.	CHITCHAT
About five years.	CHITCHAT
Um, I'm originally from Toronto, Canada.	CHITCHAT
And I moved to the states right after high school.	CHITCHAT
Which school for a couple years and then left too?	CHITCHAT
Be a web designer.	CHITCHAT
And I've lived in a bunch of different places since then.	CHITCHAT
I've lived in.	CHITCHAT
In Massachusetts, couple times.	CHITCHAT
Couple places in Connecticut now also lived in Michigan.	CHITCHAT
And also California lived in Pacifica in San Francisco.	CHITCHAT
But I think I found my happy place here on the East Coast.	CHITCHAT
The town I live in is a nice.	CHITCHAT
Quiet town half of the year.	CHITCHAT
It's a tourist town.	CHITCHAT
During the summer.	CHITCHAT
But it is fun to see all of the tourists come in.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now that I have this monsters Melton just going to drop it behind.	O
Behind the I will do some interesting overlap with that when we get to.	O
The acrylic cutting.	O
Which will likely take place on Saturday.	CHITCHAT
I will be updating.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
My Instagram and Twitter later in the week to share the plan for when we're going to do.	CHITCHAT
The glow forge and cricket work, so the paper, vinyl and laser cutting and I hope to stream those so that you can see what that process looks like.	CHITCHAT
It is super fun.	CHITCHAT
One of the most fun things I think.	CHITCHAT
To do.	CHITCHAT
And so my my goal is to share with you what that process looks like.	CHITCHAT
How to create?	CHITCHAT
How easy it is really to go from vector to the physical objects?	CHITCHAT
So again, I'll be sharing which days I'll be doing that.	CHITCHAT
I do have a schedule posted.	CHITCHAT
I think I have a copy of it.	CHITCHAT
She would jump back into my be hands for a minute.	CHITCHAT
Jump on in here.	CHITCHAT
All right, here's my schedule.	CHITCHAT
So tonight will probably stream for another half an hour or so.	CHITCHAT
See how far we can get with with this character.	CHITCHAT
Wednesday will refine it with color and do a little bit of planning for the glow forge work and then Saturday at 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time.	CHITCHAT
Got those wrong here?	CHITCHAT
Eastern Daylight Time is when will probably be doing the glow forge work, but again, I will share that on Twitter and Instagram with some updates of what to expect.	CHITCHAT
Really excited to share that process with all of you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm making a slight modification to.	O
The size of.	O
This tree, the pieces of the tree.	O
So realizing in this sketch I made a little smaller than.	O
And I normally like.	O
So I'm going to.	O
Modify a little bit.	O
OK, so now I'm going to select these three and center them.	O
Just to make sure, I still like the.	O
Balance of them.	O
Turn my schedule for a minute.	O
Not quite right.	O
This little smaller.	O
This one little smaller.	O
Fix the rounding.	O
And then let's censor those.	O
That looks better OK, and then the last piece.	O
2nd, less peace in these trees is to add a triangle on the top.	O

Shrink it down a little.	O
Smaller.	O
Let's center that.	O
Pump it up.	O
Going around.	O
Be.	O
Top most points.	O
So.	O
Actually going to make it a little larger.	O
I want to ask you it just little bit larger.	O
That's about right.	O
Looks like this isn't lined up so.	O
Make sure that.	O
Those three are centered.	O
That one still works off.	O
I think I'm going to make it smaller.	O
Nabi.	O
Then Good enough.	O
One more time to central them, group them.	O
Looks like.	O
I messed up that that's OK.	O
Alright, let's turn the sketch back on.	O
I'm gonna put a little trunk on the tree.	O
The trunk is going to sit on the bottom.	O
Here.	O
Copy of this bottom piece.	O
And use it to perfect the height of the trunk.	O
Group those.	O
I am going to make it.	O
Just a little bit smaller.	O
Little more what I want.	O
Make a copy of it and then I'm going to drag that over.	O
Will group those two sets of trees.	O
And then we should be able to select the whole piece.	O
And center it.	O
Alright, so everything should be in line now.	O
Looks like I do however need to bottom align.	O
Character.	O
Perfect OK.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Checking in here to see how we're doing with.	CHITCHAT
With the stream overall looks like we're still.	CHITCHAT
Soon.	CHITCHAT
Still, in pretty good computer wise have crashed.	CHITCHAT
She also.	CHITCHAT
Cool, OK, now I'm going to make this plant.	O
Will do it really in a similar way to how we created the.	O
The curvy arms.	O
I'm going to draw.	O
Just with straight lines, get a feel for the rough shape that I want.	O
I'm going to turn the fill off.	O
Going to make these stroke.	O
Little thicker Maybe?	O
The one that let's go to 20.	O
20 pixels also going to make this a little longer.	O
But it will end up going back behind the tree.	O
So now that I've got this, I can again switch from the from the select tool to the direct select tool which will select all the points from my shape and then I can use the corner tool.	O
To round those edges in a way that I like.	O
And do it just like that.	O
And with that done so I'm going to just lock these shapes in place.	O
So now with that done, I'll go to objects.	O
Path.	O
Outline stroke.	O
Which gives me the outline.	O

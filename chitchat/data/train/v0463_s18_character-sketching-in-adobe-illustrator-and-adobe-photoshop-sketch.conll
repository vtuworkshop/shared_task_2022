The other thing it doesn't share this earlier it also.	O
Leaves the outline.	O
I think it's in a group.	O
You get the.	O
Ungroup it.	O
Drag this over.	O
You'll see also that a stroke is left behind, where it usually is.	O
Weird OK.	O
Seems fine, so now we have to fill in dinner.	O
Reverse that will give it a white fill, a red stroke and then will just increase the width of the strokes so it matches the rest.	O
And I do want to round the top of it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Do you like that?	CHITCHAT
And then I'm going to create another going to create a leaf shape.	O
Use an ellipse to do that.	O
About what I want.	O
So then I'll select those tulips is and use the intersect tool to get a nice kind of pedal shape.	O
Get around it a little bit though.	O
And then fill it white.	O
You know, keep that Phil please.	O
What's going on in the chat?	CHITCHAT
Asciano, thank you for joining.	CHITCHAT
It is good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Hope you had a great evening.	CHITCHAT
Leon is here little earlier.	CHITCHAT
I think he may be lurking he still around.	CHITCHAT
So please don't have to be perfect.	CHITCHAT
And I will probably also end up putting a little bit of.	O
Texture into those leaves, but I want to keep them just really big and kind of balancing looking.	O
In a group.	O
Then I'll make a copy.	O
Another one down.	O
Then I think I'll get rid of this one.	O
So I'll select all of the pieces that make up.	O
That little plants to make a copy of it and flip it horizontally.	O
Awesome, so in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Passing on the saying I did I made my business coach really happy.	CHITCHAT
So my day was a success.	CHITCHAT
That is fantastic.	CHITCHAT
I'm really happy to hear that.	CHITCHAT
As for me, things are pretty good.	CHITCHAT
I had a good good day at work.	CHITCHAT
Watch the.	CHITCHAT
Apple keynotes in the early afternoon and then watch the platform.	CHITCHAT
The state of the union.	CHITCHAT
In the early evening time here, which was very nerdy and a lot of fun.	CHITCHAT
Got to geek out on some of the new stuff coming to iPad and to the iPhone from Apple.	CHITCHAT
So let's make for its made for a good day.	CHITCHAT
And most of all, I've just been avoiding the heat and I've been able to do that for the most part, which is also made.	CHITCHAT
Today pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Right, I wanna get this a little bit in the middle of.	O
From their little bit of breathing room.	O
Cool alright, so now that I've got this guy I want to see.	O
If we can get a little bit of this one.	O
Done some actually going to put it onto a separate art board for now.	O
So do that.	O
Thank you, I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Going a little free form with this, so the goal for this week is going to be to come up with a composition with some of these characters.	CHITCHAT
And then on the weekend for Saturday's stream will do.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to take this and will make a physical object, so I'll probably end up either cutting some wood or some acrylic on a laser cutter called the glow forge, and then also cut out some vinyl for color application using a cricket, which would be really fun.	O

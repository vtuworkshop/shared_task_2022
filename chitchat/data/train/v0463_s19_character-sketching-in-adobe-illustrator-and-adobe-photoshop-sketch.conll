So I'm gonna try and get all the cameras situated so that we can stream.	O
That process and I can share more of how I do those things and actually show you an example of what we're going to go for.	O
So on the weekend will take again what we're creating here in illustrator.	O
Will take this and we're going to make something like this.	O
So this is an acrylic mask.	O
It's made from stacking pieces of acrylic.	O
Um layer on layer.	O
And then in order to apply color, since I'm just using clear acrylic, what I'm doing is cutting out all of the individual shapes using a vinyl cutter.	O
That's a tool called cricket.	O
And applying those.	O
Which is which is kind of fun.	O
I like doing that because it get really pure colors.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then the other thing that I do with some of my pieces, I don't think this one is going to work in this way, but this mask has an interactive elements on it, so there's a puck on the back.	O
Right here and this puck rotates, so when it's hanging on the wall, you can actually turn the mask and it will work.	O
This way.	CHITCHAT
This was this way.	CHITCHAT
I just notice that my green screen is like keying out all the green in this mask, so there's a bunch of green here you can't see.	O
But anyway, we're going to make something like this on Saturday with the characters that were working on tonight in illustrator.	O
So if you're interested in that kind of thing then check out the stream on.	CHITCHAT
Check out the stream on the weekend.	CHITCHAT
Oh Dave and touching a nursing the audio super low isn't my mic, or is it the music or both?	CHITCHAT

Gotta respect your neighbors.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see how quickly we can layout.	O

Interesting, I'm going to turn off.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I just bumped up the music.	CHITCHAT

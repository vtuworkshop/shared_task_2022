Distribute those is that there will be no, not like that, so that they are the same.	O
Distance apart.	O
Group.	O
Make a copy and then flip them vertically.	O
I will send those to the back of the eye.	O
Snow the I made will group it.	O
Zoom out a little here.	O
Make a copy of it and flip it.	O
Of course, flip it horizontally.	O
My brain is starting to glitch a little bit later it gets.	CHITCHAT
Getting all these late hours.	CHITCHAT
It's not easy.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to use a rectangle.	O
To get this shape about right.	O
First center it with the eyes.	O
All right?	O
So that's that.	O
So again, you can see from all of this like.	O
Everything that I'm doing, I'm trying to keep.	O
With just really simple shapes.	O
That is, that is awesome.	CHITCHAT
Tatiana says I use symmetry so much in procreate.	CHITCHAT
Once that when I went to shave my legs in the shower, my brain freaked out that my one leg didn't shave at the same time this the other one that is the best thing that I've heard in a long time.	CHITCHAT
Procreate are appropriate.	CHITCHAT
Symmetry tool is great.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping eventually that will see something like that come to fresco.	CHITCHAT
That would be super cool if you've seen I mentioned this earlier, but for those of you who have joined since then, if you've seen any of the.	CHITCHAT
Any of the demos of illustrator on iPad that is coming out later this year.	CHITCHAT
There are some symmetry, an like grid repeating tools.	CHITCHAT
Coming is a part of that and it is so cool.	CHITCHAT
Really cannot wait until were allowed to start streaming that stuff so that I can show what that Workflow looks like because iPod in illustrator is a dream come true and I cannot wait.	CHITCHAT
Cannot wait.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to take this one and flip it.	O
Vertically.	O
Turn off my bounding boxes and it allows me to really easily drag and snap a shape to the point.	O
Turn the bounding box back on.	O
Lunch this end slightly.	O
It to almost back.	O
And then I'm just grouping the pieces of the nose.	O
Tatiana in the chat, since I tweeted that have tag, procreate and a lot of the work I posted that that was the thing they decided to reach we've.	CHITCHAT
Isn't it always the way?	CHITCHAT
It's never the thing that you want.	CHITCHAT
I found that now that I work digitally so often, I've tried zooming like pinching paper to zoom in or out of a thing that I'm working on.	O
I've also swiped on it to try and erase something.	O

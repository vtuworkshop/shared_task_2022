Censor them.	CHITCHAT
Wanna grab?	CHITCHAT
The overall shape just to cut these circles out to get half circles.	O
So that's using the minus front shape mode, group them and then send them backwards to go behind.	O
All right now will create this mouth.	O
Yeah, exactly, my computer would definitely be chugging.	CHITCHAT
I am in the market for a new computer.	CHITCHAT
For something to speed me up a little bit.	CHITCHAT
And holding out for a new iMac if they announce them later this year.	CHITCHAT
We'll have to see how things go.	CHITCHAT
OK, so to create the bottom lip now I'm going to break out my trusty pencil.	O
Just like this, let's turn off the fill for now.	O
Want to take this point and have it snap up top?	O
And so we can get the curve right since I didn't do it right away, will make a copy of it.	O
Flip it horizontally.	O
This again is where where a symmetry tool would be really good for me.	O
I think maybe before the next stream I'll buy.	CHITCHAT
Be astute graphics.	CHITCHAT
Plugging set so that we can maybe on the stream, experiment with its symmetry tool.	CHITCHAT
For those unfamiliar.	CHITCHAT
There is a great great company called astute graphics.	CHITCHAT
They make a set of illustrator plugins that do all sorts of really cool things.	CHITCHAT
In illustrator, including, I don't watch the video, but.	CHITCHAT
Variable stroke with effects.	CHITCHAT
Really interesting modifications to how the pen tool works.	CHITCHAT
What are some of my favorite ones?	CHITCHAT
So the symbolism.	CHITCHAT
Live simple effects is pretty awesome.	CHITCHAT
I used to have these.	CHITCHAT
I had an old version of these plugins but since creative cloud the later versions came out I think as of last year they've moved all of their plugins to subscription model.	CHITCHAT
So I want to get on to that plan.	CHITCHAT
But for me this mirror me.	CHITCHAT
Instant symmetry is the plugin that I think would save me a ton of time.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
So I think like I said, I think the plan will be to get this.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can see right here.	CHITCHAT
That's what I need right there.	CHITCHAT
I think I'll buy this before the next stream and then we'll experiment with it on the next stream, which will be Wednesday at 8:30 Eastern Daylight Time.	CHITCHAT
So if you are curious about those plugins tuning, then.	CHITCHAT
For now we will chug along in my slow way of working.	CHITCHAT
Which so slow I do enjoy.	CHITCHAT
I guess I wouldn't do it if I didn't enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so that gives us the bottom lip.	O
To do the top lip, it's much of the same.	O
This.	O
Like that?	O
Copy it, love it and flip it.	O
Turn off the bounding box and then drag it into place.	O
Join it.	O
Finishing done before.	O
Snap these lines in place.	O
For we do that.	O
First things first, we need to take these two and join them.	O
Pendants enter them.	O
That And snap peas in the place.	O
And let's select those lips one more time.	O
Jada join it just around the corner so we don't have that shaggy.	O
Sticking out.	O
Alright, I'm gonna send you the slips overtime and group them.	O

Hey everyone, I'm back tonight doing another live stream.	CHITCHAT
Making sure everything is set up here.	CHITCHAT
OK, awesome, yes.	CHITCHAT
So today actually I wanted to do.	O
To do some like illustration, floral illustrations with base.	O
And so I'm still kind of.	O
I have a couple ideas, but basically I'm just going to kind of sketch sketch some things out in.	O
Where do you want to?	CHITCHAT
Have also just like a quick little grid for myself.	O
Yes, how how's everyone doing today?	CHITCHAT
Let me know.	CHITCHAT
If you're watching, say, I'd love to hear where you're watching from, say hi in the chat, group sizes stick in.	CHITCHAT
Let me scream gloomy, clean my screen.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, let me know where you guys are watching from.	CHITCHAT
If you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
What kind of?	CHITCHAT
Um illustrations you like to do?	CHITCHAT
Alright, for some reason I don't know why it's not snapping like it should, but.	CHITCHAT
Oh well, that's OK, um?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, like I was saying I, I'm planning on doing um.	CHITCHAT
Definitely a lot of like nature themed illustrations today, so I think I.	CHITCHAT
I want to do like a plant like some type of uhm.	O
Like Vase With.	O
A cool just like flower arrangement coming out.	O
So I want to just kind of.	O
Play with some different concepts.	O
That might be really cool for it.	O
So yeah.	CHITCHAT
So as you can see, I'm just kind of building out of base right now.	O
Trying to figure out like what type of.	O
Shape I want it.	O
I don't know if I like that.	CHITCHAT
Then let's see.	CHITCHAT
So I actually just pulled up.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just Google, I guess before the quarantine happened, I went to the Chicago Art Institute and they have this really gorgeous section with different bases.	O
From the ancient Greeks.	O
And so that's kind of.	O
Um, where I wanna draw my inspiration from today as far As for the shape of the base goes.	O
So.	O
Sketching out some different.	O
Lines.	O
And when I'm working in the sketch phase.	O
I definitely like to just.	O
Do like really loose quick lines.	O
Does that actually feel like it ends up creating the best possible?	O

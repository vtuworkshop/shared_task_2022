Joined in so yeah, welcome to my stream, I'm Lisa.	CHITCHAT
The freelancer behind, made by Lisa Marie.	CHITCHAT
So I'm a freelance illustrator and graphic designer.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, today I am working in Adobe fresco which is adobes mobile drawing apps.	CHITCHAT
So I'm drawing right on top of.	CHITCHAT
My iPad and I'm working in fresco with UM in the Apple pencil and.	CHITCHAT
Yes, this is A is like one of my favorite ways to work for sure, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I usually start by drawing UM in a sketchbook.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I guess, but today I am just kind of going straight from.	CHITCHAT
Uh or straight unto unto the screen, as you can see.	O
So I guess that's actually not as common.	O
I usually do start with the sketch, but I just kind of want to show you even my sketching process, so this is just.	O
As I'm trying to figure out.	O
You know what I want to draw, uhm?	O
This is kind of my behind the scenes in figuring out the layout, so I really I think I really want to like have like crazy large Flowers so wanna keep on building them up more.	O
I guess I probably should have done a better job at finding like a reference photo.	O
But Yeah, I'm afraid I haven't.	CHITCHAT
I haven't done a floral drawing like this in a long time.	O
OK, so let's see can do some like really large peony's.	O
Which those are always really gorgeous.	O
Nice and.	O
Huge.	O
And again, right now this is just a sketch, so I'm just kind of trying to block out where.	O
I can fit everything, um.	O
So it's going to look a little hectic and crazy right now.	O
'cause I'm trying to to fill in every Nook and cranny.	O
See do you like?	O
Couple smaller ones.	O
But yeah, so this is, I guess what you call a still life which is.	O
Very traditional form.	O
Um of drawing or sketching.	O
A lot of artists.	O
If you look up pretty much any any old painter, they.	O
They all have their own versions of still lifes and it's just like a really great.	O
Um way to hunt in your skills and.	O
Yeah, it's kind of practice.	O
Practice your arrangements.	O
And OK, so this is trying to look good.	O
I think I I'm going to just kind of draw how much I want to have.	O
I think I really want Flowers, like almost be like falling out.	O
And almost like.	O
Really take up the whole nice big portion.	O

Um?	CHITCHAT
So that's going to be my guide.	O
For how much?	CHITCHAT
Bigger how wanna make all this so?	CHITCHAT
I think I need some some more peony's.	O
Can I fumbling out?	CHITCHAT
And again, I'm making up a lot of this as I'm going.	CHITCHAT
As you can probably tell, um.	CHITCHAT
Definitely one of the nice things about Flowers is.	O
You know each one is so unique in different that it's almost kind of hard to.	O
Even like draw it incorrectly because.	O
They all have their own organic shape and.	O
Yeah, you can kind of get to get away a little bit more with like this free form.	O
Type of drawing, which I find really really peaceful.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Trying to think of a couple more.	O
Flowers to include.	O
Here.	O
Will do another Peony.	O
And.	O
Do a couple more of these as well.	O
It's kind of layering them all in here.	O
And again, this is this is just my sketch, so as you can see, it's.	O
Getting pretty messy and almost like hard to.	O
To see, but that's OK because it's kind of we're just trying to figure out where we can fit everything right now and just playing with the layout and.	O
What not so this?	O
This part we should be able to just kind of.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just play with it and make it as free flowing as possible.	O
And just kind of.	O
Let the Flowers have a little bit of a mind of their own.	O
Anne will come in and make sure everything is nice and tidy up in our sketch.	O
So yeah, that I feel like taking, I think, just about like the right.	O
Body shape of it, um, see.	O
So really.	O
Text a lot more on.	O
You can kind of see the before and after.	O
Checking is is pretty fun.	O
Um, I'm going to just merge these layers together so.	O
Yeah before after OK.	CHITCHAT
And.	O
It's it's all on groups us.	O
So my only thing right now is now that I'm looking at this.	O
The base doesn't really quite make sense for this type of flower arrangement.	O
We kind of might need something that's.	O
Probably a lot.	O
Wider.	O
Like both wider and.	O
Maybe a little shorter too.	O
Say something like.	CHITCHAT

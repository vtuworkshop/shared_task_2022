Smart textures look but.	O
Is brush might be like almost a little bit too?	O
Intense and wild.	O
'cause there's just like so much variety in the UM.	O
In the shape so 'cause it's it supposed to almost be like I think like A.	O
Runny old ink nip that just kinda.	O
Has a mind of its own, a little bit, which definitely gives it some cool.	O
Variety, but.	O
Sometimes, like when I'm working on.	O
A piece that already is a little bit complicated like.	O
I like to use cleaner brushes or so.	O
It doesn't look like a total like muddy, messy.	O
Uhm?	CHITCHAT
Like what the heck is going on like this is?	O
Little too crazy.	O
So I'm just going to.	O
Drying in a couple.	O
A couple pieces and then we'll see how it looks.	O
And then I made.	O
Try a different brush instead.	O
And that's one of my favorite things about working digitally is that we can.	O
Really take advantage of the fact that.	O
Some there's layers and everything is digital, so you can try something and then if you don't like it, delete it.	O
If you're not sure, you can save it on a new layer and try something else out, like.	O
It's it's really, really nice for.	O
For experimenting without losing any.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Anything really, I mean?	CHITCHAT
I think I was talking about this in my last stream, but I just remember especially in high school and my art classes I just I would always end up ruining so many leg of my paintings and drawings because I always like to like see how far I can push things and it's kind of like, you know I learned by taking them as far as possible and then a little bit over over the edge and then it's like.	CHITCHAT
OK, like.	CHITCHAT
So when you add almost too much detail are go a little bit too crazy at.	CHITCHAT
Kind of kills it, but then like this step right before that is like its full potential so.	CHITCHAT
Working digitally is nice because I can.	CHITCHAT
I can find my limit and then you know go back a step and.	CHITCHAT
And it's perfect and.	CHITCHAT
In high school that was just not really the case.	CHITCHAT
I would just always ruin ruin my drawings and paintings, but that's OK.	CHITCHAT
It's all part of the learning experience.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is What is this one?	O
Kyle's in Fox Euro comics liner.	O
So let me just.	O
Kyle Your comics.	O
OK, so yeah, I think that that is a little bit too.	O
Like Fuzzy and.	O
And consistent I guess.	O
Here's a.	O
Pro anchor.	O
From drinker Yeah, I'm almost thinking maybe I do wanna just.	O
Do this in um.	CHITCHAT
Like a just.	O
A basic uhm factor brush and then.	O
After I'm done, I can go in and.	O
Switch out the brushes and do.	O
Or add some texture I mean.	O
'cause I feel like that's just like what's going to.	O

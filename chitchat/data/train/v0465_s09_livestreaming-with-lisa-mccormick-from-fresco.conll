So I just thought I would come.	O
Yeah, sure, show everyone how I can I come up with an idea and then my sketching out and now right now I'm playing with like How do I want to end up coloring it in?	O
So this is just.	O
This is just like a little piece of.	O
What I will end up doing.	O
I'm just kind of testing it out, so I think that is definitely not enough contrast.	O
This gets pretty lost, so I either have to change this color.	O
Yes, clear content.	O
Since that could workout wanna see, uhm?	O
If I did background color.	O
It might be.	O
Fun to keep the background color the same as the outline one so that it gives it this kind of cool.	O
Um, like play with negative space.	O
Oh, it is this called the Dahlia Flower.	O
That's good to know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is definitely one of my favorite Flowers too.	CHITCHAT
It is a pretty one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so this is the potential idea.	CHITCHAT
Still kind of playing with.	CHITCHAT
Playing with different ideas.	O
Social thinking I could do like a blue.	O
Outline.	O
And it's kind of completely break away from.	O
What we're doing, but I think that's a little bit too intense.	O
Uhm, but then of course, always black.	O
Does make everything pop really nicely?	O
Um, just realize I'm going to have to make sure that it's behind there, um?	O
We ungroup.	O
It looks like a firework with the intensity.	O
Yeah totally.	CHITCHAT
I know this is.	CHITCHAT
This is definitely getting a little bit intense right now, but thanks.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so trying to kind of figure out what color scheme I want to go with.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I'm convinced.	CHITCHAT
With this color scheme, yet, um.	O
I wonder also if I could do like are even.	O
I wonder if I could do like instead of having this is like.	O
The dark outline I could do.	O
Maybe something like that?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Couple more.	O
Ideas I want to play with.	O
Could also do.	O
It's more like a Navy.	O
Hey Camden, Camden says you think going to graphic design schools good like I like drawing but graphic design is similar.	CHITCHAT

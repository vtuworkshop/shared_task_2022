I decided to dedicate that time to working on this personal project that is kind of neglecting.	O
So this is the initial markup I did months ago.	O
I wanted to be this interactive map of Lauren Legends.	O
Basically this interactive map.	O
You can click around on click different icons that represent all the different things that reside in each region of the world and then that would pop up a piece of art with some Lauren the story and that kind of thing so you can sort of just click around on this world and it's something I can populate with all these things.	O
I want to create mainly like characters and creatures.	O
'cause that's primarily what I do, but I want to do environments and you know all these different things that you can populate world full of.	O
Kingdoms, factions, all anything I can think of, really.	O
So just kind of this fun project for me too.	O
To make stuff up with as much freedom as I want, I'm not really taking a break from that kind of him.	O
Kind of Yes and no, so this was the stuff we were working on before for this project.	O
That initial markup was done months ago just to try to visualize the idea.	O
Initially, since I don't really have anything else and now I'm actually doing concepts for the world, the people, the races, the creatures that live in this world is kind of a logical place for me to start as a character artist, so that's what you're looking at here.	O
The three in the middle that are just grey are sketches I did a bunch of initial sketches and then I've been going through and painting up each one, trying to realize it a little bit more so all the painted ones or ones we've actually worked on a 3 grayscale ones in the middle counting the human.	O
I don't even know if there's going to be humans in this.	O
That's ones I haven't done yet, but will get to at some point.	O
Now I'm taking a break from that type of development to work on the Artstation Challenge.	O
If you guys don't know what I'm talking about, you can get artstation.	O
Com.	O
If you look at the very top, it'll say challenges and if you click that you'll see some.	O
That's a box of mystery.	O
So there's like box of mystery character.	O
You can do an environment.	O
The environment challenge that they have.	O
You can do animation props and key frame design, I think so there's like 5 different challenges for this box of mystery or five different categories.	O
I should say for this box of mystery challenge.	O
Uhm, I chose to do characters 'cause That's what I do.	O
That's my main thing.	O
And now we're kind of shifting to working on that, and that's pretty much.	O
It's going to be wild.	O
It's going to be like next month.	O
I'm kind of on a tight deadline, but I'll show you guys what we've done so that initial lineup.	O
This was for the worldbuilding project, but all these things are for the art station challenge more specifically.	O
These are the six characters each character has to have, like a characteristic that goes with them, and it was like brave will from left to right.	O
It's serious, brave, joyful, Miss Chievous, Wild and leader.	O
So I'm coming up with six characters based off those traits.	O
I have a little story that ties them together.	O
Each one has like a job in this group.	O
They're basically the protectors of the second realm, not going into detail, but these Giants are kind of mythological creatures.	O
The giant on the left, and they can kind of shift between realms.	O
But it's a very secretive, magical thing.	O
You know that most people don't know about.	O
But one round kind of effects the other, so potentially theoretically if someone got into the second realm where the Giants reside, they could affect the world in pretty dramatic ways if they really wanted to.	O
So there's this ancient organization.	O
It's been around for hundreds, if not 1000 years or so.	O
That is meant to protect the second relevant, not let anyone pass into it, so that's what I'm doing there.	O
6 characters that are part of that organization.	O
They all have a job based off that characteristic, so the joyful one is a diplomat.	O
The This is actually this is the concept for the creature.	O
Not the character, so it's exit that.	O
Well, maybe I wanted this horns shouldn't have done that.	O
This pop that back up.	O
I knew I had it up for a reason.	O
Give me your horns.	O
So what I'm trying to do is set up every character to do costumes.	O
I've done costume design for three of the characters so far, or at least I've started it for three.	O
There definitely not done.	O
Now that's not what I wanted.	O
I clicked the wrong one.	CHITCHAT
As so many files opens crazy.	CHITCHAT
Also same Hudson how you doing?	CHITCHAT
By the way, I saw your comment, I just realized I didn't say anything.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why, but your interest give me so pumped up.	CHITCHAT
I go for the pump IAS music.	CHITCHAT
I can maximum pump.	CHITCHAT
That's what I'm about.	CHITCHAT
All right, there we go.	CHITCHAT
There's the horns just in case I want these horns.	O
So I'll show you guys what we're going to do for the day.	O
See these these setups.	O
This is basically a sheet so I can start doing costumes.	O
You'll see that for this and for this.	O

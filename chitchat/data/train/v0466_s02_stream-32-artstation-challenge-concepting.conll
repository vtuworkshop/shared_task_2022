And this one.	O
They all have costumes, but I gotta set up like the character to be clothed.	O
I don't have those all prepared yet, so I figured that's what we're going to do today.	O
So this one is ready.	O
We just got the base body.	O
And we can start putting some costumes.	O
This is mischievous character by the way.	O
One I did not have the.	O
Here we go.	O
So this is the wild character.	O
No horns could totally Bury the horns maybe.	O
Could be like moose horns antlers.	O
I suppose that you would call them I could.	O
They could look like this.	O
I'm not I haven't really decided that yet.	O
I'm going to want to put this on its own layer.	O
This is just can't.	O
Learners will call that, I guess.	O
So I took the character.	O
That I had originally.	O
And I modified the hand.	O
Put the head up a little bit so it was kind of tilted down for whatever reason.	O
Still kind of tilted.	O
I feel let's try it straight up and they had a little bit more.	O
When you tilt the head with ears like this attached to it, it's easy for it to get kind of like perspectively incorrect without a word perspectively.	O
He's still looking down quite a bit, which I don't know if that's odd.	O
Excuse me Got a case of the jahns.	CHITCHAT
Not even tired.	CHITCHAT
Well actually it was feeling tired a little bit ago.	CHITCHAT
Feeling pretty good right now, but.	CHITCHAT
Feel like I yawn alot just in general.	CHITCHAT
It's not even like 'cause I'm tired most of the time.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm trying to do here is just get these base bodies laid out so I can just focus on costume.	O
I realized when I shift gears too much, doing like batch work like this.	CHITCHAT
It can be kind of difficult to shift.	CHITCHAT
Out of gears too frequently, like if I'm in anatomy mode, figure drawing mode, it's a good mode to be in, but like if I have to switch from anatomy to clothing back to anatomy, back to clothing and feel like it's hard.	O
and I know this is something I've heard from like.	O
Comic book artists of different kinds of batching work for comics.	O
I've never done comics, but that batching work is helpful, so like doing all the page layouts in one go and then doing all the.	O
Pencilling for example, and then all the inking like doing it in batches like that rather than just one page all the way through.	O
And the next page all the way through.	O
I've heard people say that they work faster like that.	O
I have done that in the past for different projects.	O
And this is a very minor version, but.	O
Rather than like working 1 character through all the way.	O
It seems like it almost makes more sense just to.	O
Be like, Alright, Let's get off bodies laid out and all the costumes laid out.	O
I didn't do that initially.	O
It's kind of going one by one and I realized it wasn't.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to focus.	CHITCHAT
It's like if you switch gears too much, it's.	CHITCHAT
It's like you're trying to work on a problem, and then someone keeps interrupting you, but it almost feels like you don't really get enough time to actually.	CHITCHAT
Really get into it and delve into it deeply.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's maybe better.	CHITCHAT
And then I'll revert it.	CHITCHAT
I do this a lot.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you guys there's like a few safeguards you can do it.	CHITCHAT
You know you can do.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't work as much with painting, but in general you can do like smart objects and stuff for non destructive editing you can make duplicates of layers.	CHITCHAT
You can make clipping mask, so there's a lot of things you can do to create Nondestructively Adjustment Layers.	CHITCHAT
But a lot of times since I like painting destructively it just feels more.	CHITCHAT
Natural I revert a lot so I won't save it and I'll be aware that I haven't saved it for awhile.	CHITCHAT
I'll do that.	CHITCHAT
Then I'll just control Z and then control shift Izzy, which reminds me I don't think I have my tool timeline on 'cause I'm a goof.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
No, not control Z anymore.	CHITCHAT

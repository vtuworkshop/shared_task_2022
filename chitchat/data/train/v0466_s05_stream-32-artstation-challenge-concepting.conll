Like I'll show it.	O
As part of my concepting phase for sure and that's the whole point.	O
I mean it's not the whole point.	O
But It's good to have these.	O
Concept.	O
Iterations these design iterations for your portfolio out.	O
So that's why I'm doing it.	O
'cause I'm always kind of a week with that.	O
Always like do.	O
Excuse me, the arms get me again.	O
Always do like a finished character painting, but not.	O
Not like all the design iterations and stuff.	O
It's usually just one off so.	O
Portfolio purposes and for the same thing.	O
For this challenge, I'm trying to do a little bit better in that Department.	O
Make these a bit smaller.	O
OK, did that not work?	CHITCHAT
So what I'm trying to set up right now is just the.	O
Sheet for all of these guys.	O
So I can just.	O
Move on to costume.	O
So we're going to do this one and we're going to do I think, just one more character.	O
Think we had three, so this would be 4.	O
No?	O
Maybe it's 2.	O
I don't know, maybe I'm crazy alright.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's check real quick.	CHITCHAT
Mac said this right now.	CHITCHAT
I don't need it.	CHITCHAT
Um course I need it done done.	CHITCHAT
Done, done.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, just two more.	CHITCHAT
The serious one.	CHITCHAT
After this, I forgot that we already did it for that one, or that I did it off stream.	O
Doesn't turn off the screen, but simple doesn't work for the.	O
But instead you're moving the cursor around on your monitor screen.	O
Oh gotcha, OK?	CHITCHAT
Interesting.	CHITCHAT
How big is it?	O
How many inches?	O
Is it something that's like practical to kind of put down in front of your monitor?	O
Right, so this is good.	O
We could do like an their concepts too.	O
Put the antlers on one of these guys.	O
I forgot that that would require height.	O
I gotta leave some height for these guys.	O
Let's make them even smaller.	O
That too small.	O
Good enough I think.	O
Oh OK, so fairly small night.	O
I don't know why I was thinking they were bigger so it's.	CHITCHAT
Just a little bit bigger than my iPad total, then I think.	O
Yeah, that's pretty reasonable then to put like on your desk and use more like an intuos.	O
It's a bit of a lean completely under my monitor.	O
Oh OK, so your monitors like raised a little bit.	O
Unless you just said it's a bit of Lean, Yeah.	O
So realizing how rough this this body of the Gore Shaws.	O

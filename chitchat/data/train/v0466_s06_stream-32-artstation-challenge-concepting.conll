I wonder if I want to work on that a little bit more.	O
So as I just want to move some stuff around here.	O
Alright, Yeah this this gorsha is.	O
It's not really important.	O
I kinda wanna do it will spend like a little bit of time.	O
Painting this guy out because it just looks.	O
Super unfinished to Maine and that's fine.	O
'cause this is just the costume but.	O
This can also be used or this will be used for my normal world building.	O
So having it worked up helps.	O
Making just use this for the costume Ng anyway, so.	O
Some of them I had to repaint.	O
Because the pose or the angle?	O
It's grayscale that I have this on my other monitor.	O
It hard to tell 'cause it's pretty desaturated but.	O
Putting it grayscale for myself.	O
Just for.	O
Reference so I want to go decently darker.	O
I'm realizing this is like my deepest dark and actually you can't see it.	O
You guys can't see my color Picker unfortunately.	O
But I would say it's maybe like 80%.	O
Something like that.	O
Want to getting closer to maybe?	O
90% black You can kind of.	O
See that difference right there.	O
Deep in.	CHITCHAT
Deep in the contrast to bid on some of this.	O
I'm doing my.	O
One of my go to brushes here, which is the hard round brush with zero opacity and this much tool.	O
If you guys haven't seen me work before, this is a pretty common method.	O
I you're going to see it mostly when I'm doing like skin and stuff.	O
If it's Anatomy that I'm doing skin.	O
Especially if I'm really trying to emphasize some 3 dimensional form.	O
Then this probably the Brush Shield.	O
Very possibly see me use.	O
But I use three brushes and they all kind of have.	O
A strong point to them.	O
I also like.	O
Brush I used the vast majority of the time I can switch over to that.	O
This guy.	O
The more rectangular one.	O
This is when I really like for like Chiseling forms.	O
Trying to think in like planar forms.	O
And then I can still use that with this much tool, so I'll just as much things softly.	O
Smudge tools just for blending, really.	O
Anna Davis court.	O
What's going on?	CHITCHAT

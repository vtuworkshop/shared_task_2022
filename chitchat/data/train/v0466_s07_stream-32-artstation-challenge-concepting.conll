How you doing all those muscles?	O
Yes.	O
This guy was looking a little unfinished to me, so before we jump into his part of the project that I try to fix them up.	O
But anatomy painting is kind of my roots.	CHITCHAT
You guys don't know Maine.	CHITCHAT
My work way before, when I first started trying to paint.	CHITCHAT
I was just trying to learn how to draw the human figure so it was all like.	CHITCHAT
Anatomy studies and portrait studies.	CHITCHAT
So for the longest time when I was like pursuing, I want to be a concept artist, counting from the beginning identified what I want.	CHITCHAT
My goal to be in.	CHITCHAT
Went towards that pretty early on, but like all I did was figure drawing for a long time so couldn't draw costumes well so all my things are just shirtless buff dudes and.	CHITCHAT
Definitely graduated from beyond that with learning how to do costume design and such, but.	CHITCHAT
Still, definitely.	CHITCHAT
A big part of what I do.	CHITCHAT
By the way, guys, if you don't know Hannah Davis court, check her out.	CHITCHAT
If you haven't seen her around here.	CHITCHAT
She's around the Adobe.	CHITCHAT
Be Hans is quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure most of you know her, but if you don't check out hairstyles, awesome.	CHITCHAT
Quite different than my style.	CHITCHAT
But like a super.	CHITCHAT
Super.	CHITCHAT
Cohesive style like a really solid aesthetic to her work that I really like.	CHITCHAT
I would think it's cool when people have a.	CHITCHAT
Very, but you can tell their styles developed like it's intentional, it's developed.	CHITCHAT
They know what they're doing, what they're going for hitting that mark well.	CHITCHAT
That's more where I'm trying to get with my work.	CHITCHAT
But A lot of my stuff lately has been pursuing that, like what look.	CHITCHAT
am I going for?	CHITCHAT
I guess that's what we just talked about maybe 1015 minutes ago and I was explaining that.	CHITCHAT
But it's funny, 'cause I never really thought about that much when I was first working.	CHITCHAT
Like what style do I want?	CHITCHAT
So I wasn't something I thought about, just me trying to pursue things I thought looked cool.	CHITCHAT
And then they kind of work their way into your style.	CHITCHAT
But now I'm actually thinking about it a bit more.	CHITCHAT
So we're not going to work on him too much.	CHITCHAT
I definitely want to get the costumes going today and again, if any was just coming in.	O
I'm doing the art station challenge, so I'm just trying to set up these figure.	O
Poses here like this so I can do some concept iterations on them for costume this we've kind of doodle doubt some this is the poses am considering using.	O
I'll probably modify the leaders pose.	O
I don't really like her pose a lot.	O
Actually, I want to do that now.	O
I was meaning to do that earlier off stream 'cause I looked at it and I want to do it like while it's fresh in my head.	O
But I was kind of wondering, actually, let's just duplicate her.	O
Yeah, that's good.	O
Kind of wondering if I wanted to put her hand up a bit more.	O
Give it a little bit more like a power pose.	O
You know, I'm just going to draw it out maybe.	O
Let's try this real quick.	O
A lot of times redrawing it's just easier than trying to.	O
Maybe like having our hands out wider.	O
And this one I was thinking about having her arms raised up higher.	O
He's beautiful, love seeing itself to hard to edge rendering.	O

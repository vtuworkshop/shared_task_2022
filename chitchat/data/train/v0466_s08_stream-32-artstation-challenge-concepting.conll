Yeah yes, definitely something I'm trying to get better at and that's that's another part of the equation.	CHITCHAT
So if anyone's just come in and we were just talking about how there's this sweet spot between rendered and painterly that I feel like I've been pursuing it my whole life.	CHITCHAT
I've been drawing, but like I've been going for that for such a long time, like trying to find what 'cause I'd like aspects of both.	CHITCHAT
I love you know, those paintings that are super painterly.	CHITCHAT
But I like it when.	CHITCHAT
That's the case, but there's like a focal point in the piece that's more rendered.	CHITCHAT
I think that's cool, so it's always something I'm trying to get better at defined what that is.	CHITCHAT
I mean, there's also that with how stylized I'm going like, how.	CHITCHAT
Realistic and gritty, versus like more cartoony, am I going for?	CHITCHAT
But then.	CHITCHAT
Like just how the texture and how the finishes is something else too, but I'm kind of going for.	CHITCHAT
Like piano, Jablonski has this really heavy texture and I love that, but it's like, is that actually what I'm going for in my own work?	CHITCHAT
No, there's there's a certain look I like in my own work where I get some nice soft edges, but also hard edges, and I've always liked that look.	CHITCHAT
You can.	CHITCHAT
Nail those both down pretty well.	CHITCHAT
So I was like these little.	CHITCHAT
I guess it's a lot more subtle things that I'm thinking about.	CHITCHAT
Suppose it's not all settled.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of.	CHITCHAT
The bigger question is more.	CHITCHAT
Broad things, I'm trying to figure out with my work too, but.	CHITCHAT
So a lot of stylistic like subtleties to that I've been thinking about lately, which isn't something I would usually care about.	CHITCHAT
Right, I think maybe that's when you're getting closer to.	CHITCHAT
Like finding out your style actually supposed to be or what you're trying to achieve, or stay with your work.	CHITCHAT
Those questions may become more relevant.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, so this is what I was thinking off.	CHITCHAT
Stream this pose up top.	O
It almost looks like more powerful.	O
Just 'cause your arms are out wider.	O
It's almost like less timid, more confident.	O
I'll have to change her proportions and everything 'cause she's supposed to be.	O
Let me show you the people she is.	O
I have so many tabs open this is her, so these are the concepts I'm not sure exactly which costume I like a few of am the one with the check marks are the ones that kind of like but she is of the race that is called Diedrus.	O
She's a dangerous which are kind of like these elf goblin looking people.	O
Where is it address?	O
Here we go.	O
Yet another document were open.	O
So she's kind of these smaller.	O
Dodgers, people, then they're not super tall.	O
If you guys saw the height sheet right, I'm going to explode photo shop with all these documents.	O
If you guys saw the height sheet of all the creatures that we've created for this world building project so far, it's these green people here and you can see their height relative to the other ones.	O
They're not super tall like compared to humans.	O
You know they're probably.	O
I don't know what is that like 5 feet, something like that.	O
About the same height as these people.	O
So.	O
Definitely have to redo her proportions when we actually go to draw her out, but I just did some very general human a tie proportions here.	O
Bit link here.	O
Then she probably should be.	O
I don't know.	O
I think that poses a little bit better off to come back to it.	O
I just want to get out of my head.	O
Plant people yeah yeah.	CHITCHAT
So the idea?	CHITCHAT
I guess they didn't mention that we talked about it last, but the idea behind these people is that they're kind of these goblini	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
That's not the document I want.	CHITCHAT
The kind of these goblini elf people that live in the forest.	O
And their hair.	O
Basically resembles foliage, so it's kind of like a camouflage characteristic that they have.	O
So it's almost like a ghillie suit.	O
Or, like a ghillie blanket if they grow it really long.	O
But I figured their hair kind of looks like vines and leaves and you know it.	O
So it's almost probably kind of like Dreadlock Lucky with how it hangs down in certain areas.	O
So.	O
That's kind of the idea behind it.	O
We have more sketches that was some of the.	O

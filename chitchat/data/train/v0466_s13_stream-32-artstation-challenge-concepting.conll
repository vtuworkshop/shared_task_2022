I think we're.	O
Ready to start doing the costumes?	O
I don't know if this guys stands well.	O
I don't think it matters.	O
'cause I have opposed in mind for this character as I do for every character.	O
I think this post works.	O
The pose is actually going to take is going to be a lot more like stand up straight type, so we'll see how that goes.	O
This is the serious character, by the way.	O
The series character is a studious character.	O
A scholar.	O
A historian.	O
So he's gonna be wearing robes and stuff.	O
Can have books hanging from him.	O
This can be ready to rock.	O
Please.	CHITCHAT
I do not.	CHITCHAT
If anyone knows how to get rid of that thing, I think it's Chrome that pops up news stories on my computer.	CHITCHAT
It several times a day.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how to get rid of it.	CHITCHAT
I looked it up but.	CHITCHAT
It didn't work.	CHITCHAT
So if anyone happens to know what that is.	CHITCHAT
Please rescue my sanity and let me know how to get rid of it.	CHITCHAT
Copy and paste equals instant hard.	O
Right now we got an army of this guy.	O
Very intimidating, got armies involved, so here are the poses for the challenge.	O
I'm doing 6 unique characters.	O
Who knows if we want to finish in time, it's going to be really tough.	O
But here's the six characters.	O
Well, I got like 7.	O
There we go.	O
Let's put this one back down here.	O
I think I like this pose a little bit more.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then, uh, we got this guy ready for costume and.	O
We got her costumed up.	O
We got them ready for costume and.	O
This guy I can revert.	O
I can save.	O
Yeah, I'll just save this an exit.	O
I don't need this document right now.	O
We got this guy worked up.	O
I just started his costume Ng so I have no idea what we're doing with him.	O
Some sort of shawls, some sort of robe, some sort of something?	O
These these creatures don't typically wear clothing.	O
The only type of clothing they wear really is ceremonial clothing of some kind or something to indicate status.	O
So I'm just thinking like a piece of fabric draped over him and it's sort of like shell type of fashion.	O
But none of these are quite hit the mark.	O
So this is the brave character there, like a spy, an information gatherer.	O
So I want them to look kind of stealthy, but also like they could go into town and then they wouldn't look too suspicious.	O
I don't want them dressed like a ninja or anything like that.	O
I was really like the bottom right one previously, but now I'm wondering if.	O
I'd like more of like the top right.	O
I'm not sure will come back to these, so I just want to get the idea is starting to get down, so let's put these characters in the beginning.	O
The first three tabs, 'cause they already done and then.	O
Put this in the very first tab 'cause.	O
Try that again.	CHITCHAT
Sweet.	CHITCHAT
So the poses we will eventually use once we choose a costume design.	O
The brave character.	O
The joyful character, the leader character.	O
And now we need the mischievous.	O
The wild character and the serious character.	O
We have not save this document.	O
So let's go ahead and save that.	O
Serious.	CHITCHAT
So we will call this serious concepts.	O
What is the headpiece for the big rock?	O
I was part of the torso piece and not a separate one.	O

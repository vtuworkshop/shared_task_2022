Or if it overlapped like let me see where is he?	O
You mean like a hood almost?	O
Make some sort of thing that attaches.	O
Indeed, the sharpies.	O
It definitely could be.	CHITCHAT
Definitely could be.	CHITCHAT
We make the rules here.	CHITCHAT
No one can tell us No.	CHITCHAT
We are the Masters of our own destiny.	CHITCHAT
Kind of neat.	CHITCHAT
Just overlapped, yeah.	O
I also had the idea that like what if you had.	O
I don't know what he adds up in gold rings.	O
Seeing some sort of like bracelet type thing, but I don't know if that would look right.	O
And there's ceremonial bracelets.	O
He lives looking more like a I don't know.	O
I give you some shaman or something or fortune teller.	O
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
As far as head pieces go.	O
I don't really know what they would even.	O
Look like it.	O
Be hard to do like I had piece, that's not.	O
Piece of fabric.	O
And it basically looks like a hood.	O
So Miss Chievous, Oh man, that who that one could be interesting 'cause there's alot wild character could be kind of easy ish 'cause I kinda know what I want from them and serious character.	O
I know what I want but there's a lot of possibilities.	O
So what do you guys think?	CHITCHAT
Put an M for the mischievous character.	CHITCHAT
They're going to be dressed a little bit more flamboyantly.	O
An M if you guys want to see the mischievous character AWWAW.	O
If you want to see the wild character there going to be more in like leather armor of some kind.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Or an S for serious character there going to be a scholar of history, and they're going to be in robes.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
If anyone has an opinion, feel free.	CHITCHAT
M for Miss Chievous.	O
Which is more flamboyant gesture like?	O
W for wild, which is more leather armor?	O
And S for serious, which is going to be more of a robed historian, scholar, major looking person.	O
While you're doing that, if anyone does have an opinion, of course if you don't, don't worry about it.	O
Oh, you know what I forgot to do?	CHITCHAT
A little late.	CHITCHAT
Forgot to the Post that I was going live on the discord.	CHITCHAT
Silly me.	CHITCHAT
Maybe something with more height on it?	O
I just the shapes aren't really coming to Maine.	O
Something like with height 'cause we're talking height.	O
It would have to be a hat.	O
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
It looks like a fireman hat.	O
Dunce cap or wizard hat.	O
I mean, I can do whatever I want, like there's no way it has to look, but.	O

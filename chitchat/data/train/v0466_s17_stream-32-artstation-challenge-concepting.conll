About the inside of the Cape.	O
Being a little bit.	O
Red And I will say that there.	O
They were the only one that responded, Wolf.	O
CSRM he gets M.	O
SRM is Miss Chievous or serious.	O
That means we're going with wild just to spite Wolf.	O
Well, how much time do we have?	CHITCHAT
At 6:07?	CHITCHAT
I think that means we have like 30 minutes left.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, just about 30.	CHITCHAT
So.	O
If it was just coming in or anything like that is not in costumes for these different characters, these are poses of all the characters.	O
They all have different jobs.	O
Different characteristics were trying to convey.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Said You Guess M, so let's do it.	CHITCHAT
Let's do it.	CHITCHAT
Let's it's the next in line as far as my tabs are arranged, which means absolutely nothing but.	O
Do it anyway.	O
I have a document.	O
So mischievous character is illusionist and Asaba Tour the only one who steps into the Plains between the realms to misdirect those who might take who might make it that far.	O
So these are the protectors of the second realm.	O
If anyone actually steps into the passageway between realms she you know it's kind of this.	O
I don't know what it looks like, but I imagine it's kind of this confusing.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Confusing space.	CHITCHAT
Let me forget that I still have this document open up another window, so she creates illusions.	O
Maybe she makes it look like they're not actually in the realms or in the Plains between the realms.	O
Maybe it looks like there in a forest and that they made a wrong turn somewhere, so just whatever she can do to kinda misdirect them, scare them, maybe she.	O
Manifest the illusion of some sort of monster to chase them away.	O
You know, could be a lot of things.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But not only that, there's magic to create illusions like that, but.	O
Also, maybe just general sabotaging.	O
Kind of create chaos mess with them, distract them whatever.	O
So I was picturing since she's Miss Chievous this kind of picturing almost just more.	O
A little bit like.	O
Jester looking almost.	O
I always forget what those things are called.	O
Landers There's these soldiers, but I more ancient soldiers that I always reference.	O
Can never remember what they're called.	O
Oh man, that's funny.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even get close.	CHITCHAT
I put Lander, SNCHT, soldier, and Google knows what I want, its land lands.	O
Connect I don't know how you actually say it.	O
Anyway, this is this is what I was looking for.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Whatever this word is here.	O
Lance connect They have these gesture reappearance to them, so I was thinking something like that.	O
For this this character.	O
You text isn't showing.	CHITCHAT
OK, it's good now.	CHITCHAT
Full body hat.	O
Think someone just called that are oh baby.	O
How you doing?	CHITCHAT
By the way, Camden.	O
Less detailed, a better well.	O
I mean I'm trying to go big shapes first, so most of these aren't very detailed, but like the big shapes of the clothing and the silhouettes.	O

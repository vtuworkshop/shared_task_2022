Definitely trying to get first and then I work my way down to more.	O
More of the details.	O
I don't even think it's safe to say that we've gone into details at all yet, but.	O
We will once we find the base design that we like.	O
Something with poofy sleeves, the must.	O
Thinking she's going to have like a lot of oh whoops.	O
Apparently I did not create a new layer.	O
'cause I'm a goof?	CHITCHAT
Don't be like, Maine.	CHITCHAT
Lock your layers.	O
And then create a new one.	O
Costume.	O
I was just kind of talking about art in general.	CHITCHAT
Oh, OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh sorry, that's a question you're saying is less, more or less detail the better.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
Cameron Cameron.	CHITCHAT
Sorry Camden misunderstood that.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I think it completely depends less is more.	CHITCHAT
I don't know when I hear the phrase less is more what I think of.	CHITCHAT
Is.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Like to not try to overly complicated design.	CHITCHAT
And focus on the big the big idea.	CHITCHAT
Now this doesn't even have to be in terms of Art, but just the phrase less is more, I think.	CHITCHAT
Typically the simplest solution is the best or the most practical.	CHITCHAT
And in art I think.	CHITCHAT
I think you need.	CHITCHAT
A hierarchy of detail, a hierarchy of focal points, usually a hierarchy.	CHITCHAT
Is kind of present and everything, so if you have a composition, usually you have like big, medium, small shapes.	CHITCHAT
You know you have a primary to secondary and tertiary and that can be a composition.	CHITCHAT
For an illustration where there's a whole scene you don't want like 10 different characters in that scene and they're all the exact same size and the exact same focus in the exact same contrast usually want like 1 character.	CHITCHAT
That's the focal point or something like that.	CHITCHAT
It's the same thing with costumes.	CHITCHAT
So the way that would apply to costumes is we need some big shapes, some medium shapes, some small shapes.	CHITCHAT
So maybe the big shapes are these sleeves and pants.	CHITCHAT
And then she's wearing like a jacket.	CHITCHAT
Which creates these large shapes, right?	CHITCHAT
And then from here maybe there's some like.	CHITCHAT
Smaller shapes that she had these socks on.	CHITCHAT
And maybe, maybe there's like little hand wraps or something that similar color and then like a headpiece.	CHITCHAT
But like you're basically.	CHITCHAT
Going off into these big shapes and right there, we've established and overall silhouette and general idea, and then from there maybe I want to do some like.	CHITCHAT
Secondary shape, so maybe within this costume there's some like.	CHITCHAT
Designs and trim.	CHITCHAT
You know, you catch that a few places so you kind of want to go big medium small shapes.	CHITCHAT
So when I don't know, I don't know if less is more generally, but yeah, I don't think you should be jumping into details right away.	CHITCHAT
I can definitely say that.	CHITCHAT
I think you want to focus on what I would emphasize more as they should focus on the big ideas, the big shapes, the big composition, the big color scheme, you know, whatever it.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's why you guys are going to see me, not zoom in pretty much throughout the entire T of all these concepts.	CHITCHAT
I'll zoom in when we're actually working on a character in detailing it, but like when we're at this point, there's no reason to zoom in like, even when I was painting this character.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what my level of zoom was when I was painting his body, but it's probably here.	CHITCHAT
'cause there's nothing good that's going to come from zooming in.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to lose sight of the big picture.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to lose.	CHITCHAT
Site of like the big value scheme and everything and just how things look from afar.	CHITCHAT
And if it's if this shapes that I'm trying to paint and render, are affective shapes.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
It's why you pretty much.	CHITCHAT
Never see main zoom in super close, at least at this stage.	CHITCHAT
May be at the other stages, but if the entire graphic read is something you pretty much see from here.	CHITCHAT
Didn't show my text for some reason, but they were not that important, alright?	CHITCHAT

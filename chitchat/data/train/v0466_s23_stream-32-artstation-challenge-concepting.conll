I don't know.	O
Do they have something called the illusionist?	O
I remember mezmur, but he said illusionist.	O
That's where my brain went.	O
Yeah, I think having like a bit of elegance like that, it's pretty cool.	O
I don't like how dressy it is in terms of like it looks like she's going to.	O
A fancy dinner, you know, like the one with the white vest?	O
I think that's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
I think there's some.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think some of those work on some level.	O
I feel like there's going to be a lot of ideas.	O
I want to try it with this 'cause I do want to go for that elegant look to a little bit more.	O
I want to play around with like the line between gesture, an elegant which I haven't done any elegant yet.	O
I'm definitely doing the gesture more.	O
First image to be colorful, whimsical, well being sexy.	O
Not having much color outside purple, yeah?	O
Yeah, some of 'em.	O
Like the one with the white vest.	O
And the one in the very right.	O
Think have some elements that I think are kind of cool.	O
Now I could try more.	O
Refined shapes like that.	O
Yeah, I played on the dresses.	O
Yeah, it's somewhere we're going to try to find a sweet spot between all these costumes.	O
This is one of those ones where I don't know super clearly what I want.	O
Actually whenever I look at this, I see it more.	O
I think maybe I should start with like a serious base.	O
And then try adding the more gestri elements onto it as much as little as I want.	O
Feel like adding this gesture elements first, it's making a little bit hard to.	O
Do anything to that you know, I mean.	O
Like add more.	O
Fabric flowing out of the front or something.	O
So many ones just coming in.	O
Or wondering what we're doing?	O
I'm doing 6 characters for the art station.	O
Challenge that they got going on right now and this is the Miss Chievous character whose kind of like this, illusionist and saboteur.	O
But I don't really know what I'm going for.	O
The for the costume quite yet, so this is completely like I have to put some ideas out there before I can know if it's even close or if I have to go a different direction, pull, push, and pull in whatever way.	O
So right now if you're looking at what looks like really random designs, that's 'cause it is, but I'm hoping these will allow me to kind of find the idea.	O

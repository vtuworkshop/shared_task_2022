Not necessarily the color scheme, but like it's a skirt basically.	O
And then like some sort of sleeve short sleeve thing but the.	O
The longer sleeves are more ruffled and Poofy, and then like the part of the legs that showing it's basically ruffled and Poofy at the knee and then straight at the leg.	O
I think that's kind of cool.	O
So something like that.	O
They have like a fun.	O
Shape of the skirt.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I need to pick like a dominant color here.	O
I'm going with these Blues lately, so.	O
Just get that silhouette, at least working in.	O
So these ones up here that you guys are seeing aren't anywhere near finished.	O
This is all pretty loose, but it's kind of a balance between getting an idea out like OK, that's an idea for sleeve.	O
Let's try this.	CHITCHAT
Let's try this leave so I have to go to a new one for each sleeve.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But I'll definitely go back to these 'cause none of these work right now.	O
The closest one to working this one.	O
I like it.	CHITCHAT
I like this direction and that's the whole thing I have to try these ideas out to be like, OK, I really don't like the gesture.	O
Look like it's.	O
I mean.	O
There's aspects of it.	O
I like those aspects of this one I like, but it's not the the mood.	O
This one gets pretty.	O
Pretty close to the mood maybe.	O
But then I have to go back and change the ones like this.	O
Looks like just a pirate.	O
This middle one.	O
I don't like it.	O
It's one of the right.	O
There's not really much there.	O
I still haven't done like the bottom of the legs and.	O
Anything going on here looks like maybe she could use a.	O
Ruffled something.	O
We need ruffles somewhere.	O
So this is just like a starting point really.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like the white.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like these stark white with the dark blue, but then there's some playful like orange in there.	O
And then there's some like fancy kind of gold trim.	O
I think there's some balance that I'm enjoying with that.	O
It.	O
Too busy, yeah?	CHITCHAT
Things like about them.	O
I think getting like a touch of the field of this one in something a little bit more formal doing like a formal base and then.	O
Like what what do I like about this is kind of like the puffiness of the sleeves and what have you.	O
So is that.	O
Pushing it back and pulling it forward like that.	O
Balance of push and pull.	O
You go too far on one feeling one mood, one idea when motif.	O
You push it back.	O
Kind of like a little bit something else, like maybe the elegance pull that forward more.	O
It's kind of like you're just trying to find that nice balance between the two.	O
First you have to find out what the different feeling feelings, even our first ones, kind of gesture.	O
The second one is kind of that elegant idea with the whole mesmer thing that you brought up.	O
I think I like their shapes.	O
Yeah, I kind of like the somewhat narrow shoulders.	O
With the poofy sleeves.	O
I don't know about the legs.	O
But that kind of.	O
I wanna say Bell shape but I don't think that's what it is I don't know that kind of shaped like that.	O
Kind of enjoy.	O
And it just makes me think like 1 where the shoulders are exposed could be kind of cool.	O
Yeah, you gotta get the ideas before you can scale and back.	O

See if this works.	CHITCHAT
OK hi everyone, thank you so much for joining me up.	CHITCHAT
I just want to show.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can turn this off.	CHITCHAT
OK, so how everyone for joining me on a everyday working hour where I just talk a little bit about what I'm working on and.	CHITCHAT
Maybe go through different tools.	O
I wouldn't actually go through my name is Jeannie.	CHITCHAT
I'm one of the product designers on that be hands team and I will be answering any questions you have in chat.	CHITCHAT
Let me just throw that in the chat if you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
OK so today is a little special because I'm demo ING a little bit of mine.	CHITCHAT
You have and you can see if I don't pull everything up.	CHITCHAT
I haven't had any like it's like ASM are but but not this mostly mouse clicking that you hear.	CHITCHAT
Wanted to talk a little bit about this that can you see this?	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
This pins that I made.	O
This is a set of enamel pins that I made a while back and illustrator and I thought it would be really interesting 'cause I get a lot of questions about.	O
You know how I made them?	O
You know what the process looks like.	O
People are always really interested in making handmade objects, or if not handmade, but just like physical objects that you can order, and so I thought it would be kind of nice for us to talk about it together and I can actually walk you through some of my files.	O
Any first before I start let me show you what they look like.	O
Well, maybe you can share the creepiness of the.	O
Of the.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is what it looks like when it's being sold through the link and also.	O
Showing.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is what that pen looks like in real life, so this is already something I've made.	O
You can see it kind of spins a little bit when it's in its packaging and it comes in a little plastic bag and I'll open open it for you so you can see that looks like and I saw him on my website.	O
It's not really a big revenue stream for me.	CHITCHAT
That's not why I do what I do, but I think it's kind of interesting and nice to have something that you made and to practice making things that are outside of your medium.	O
And so my normal medium at work would be UX design.	O
Or web design, which is always very screen based, so it's kind of nice so you can kind of there you go into focusing.	O
Oh yeah, it's focusing great and you can see it's kind of spins based on the.	O
Based on the.	O
The weight of the pin, but there are a few components to this and what I really love about this pin is that it comes in a variety of shapes, so let's see what that means.	O
ASM are except it's ripping plastic zones.	O
OK, So what you saw in the.	O
In the original version, is this penny pin.	O
This is probably my most popular design, which is it's a true keep.	O
In the bottom is a skull and the top is a Peony.	O
And well I've actually done is.	CHITCHAT
I've made a series of them that all kind of our have different tops.	O
So for example this is the orchid top and this is the Anthurium top math and three on top and then they each stack on the same school so that.	O
The idea was kind of that people could interchange these goals and I could come up with a design that would stack perfectly.	O
So here's here.	CHITCHAT
It is with Imperium's.	O
You can see that I feel like a beauty Blogger.	O
Don't give these bloggers out there like I hope you can see this.	O
And here is the orchid one and at specs, and so when they cut together perfectly they stack in Nice and neat.	O
Kind of like the difference.	O
Mirrored on my screen.	O

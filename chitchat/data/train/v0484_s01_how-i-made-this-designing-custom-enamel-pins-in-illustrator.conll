But that's what I mean and.	O
Hi song, this is life height 8.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining in after my last one failed.	CHITCHAT
I feel like the video quality is deteriorating as I speak.	CHITCHAT
I can see.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
I can read them here.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let me show you what I do and how I make these in illustrator and then we'll talk a little bit about what the process looks like, 'cause I think that's a big part of the questions.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
You hear me OK.	CHITCHAT
I think all right.	CHITCHAT
So here is the illustrator file so depends on the way.	O
Scared the illustrator file that I was working with when I made this.	O
Let me just show you what this looks like.	O
There are a lot of random artboards.	O
I'm not super good about keeping more upwards mega clean, but you can kind of see what I'll do is.	O
I'll have some preliminary sketches and also references to other objects, so here are like some images that I liked on colors that I wanted to pull from.	O
Um, like other flower and schools.	O
And that's a pretty common motifs that I kind of wanted to try using that.	O
In other places and then I transferred them into outlines so you can kind of see that there and.	O
And then I felt it in with color.	O
And this is where it was really handy to ask people on, you know, I think I asked them behind on my work in progress.	O
I also threw it into my Twitter and Instagram to see what people really liked for color combinations.	O
'cause I ultimately, you know, I like the white skull because myself, but I just wanted to see if other people kind of had impressions of what they thought would be better.	O
So there are a few variations of this different color variations like red pennies instead of pink ones.	O
You can kind of see what they look like, sorry.	O
What they look like soft and next to each other?	O
And then later I sent this completed.	O
This kind of break down to the actual.	O
Factory you can kind of see my very chunky if my punky looking descriptor Here of what is happening, but I thought that was kind of useful because I wanted the factory to understand what I was working with.	O
In other words, to have two different pieces that interchange or the top piece would interchange.	O
and I also make sure to give them the exact Pantone colors that I was looking for.	O
I'm here.	CHITCHAT
And then I mocked up a few versions of things that I liked in for the actual backing cards.	O
So let me switch my view so you can see that that looks like.	O
OK, so this is the actual backing card.	O
Let's look blurry.	CHITCHAT
OK, there it is.	CHITCHAT
That's actually backing card.	O
It has like a gold foil and in the back has like a little line of text.	O
This one is from one of my favorite novels, which is The Great Gatsby.	O
It says all the bright, precious things fade so fast and they don't come back.	O
And then the front of the car.	O
It also says all the bright precious things.	O
Now it was funny.	CHITCHAT
It was about shiny pins and also.	O
Cuss colder just typically representative of mortality, and all those, all those things, and then altogether the goal was to create something that looked like this.	O
Spending a little.	O
So they picked one a better one for the download app instance so much.	O
And see that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's switch my feedback.	CHITCHAT
OK, so that's where this design came from.	O
When you're actually exporting the design for something, I used moo cards for this for their gold foil.	O
I can actually drop that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Mood, I think that's what it is and they have shiny.	O
Gold foil business cards.	O
OK, so so long as you know why are you talking about this idea?	CHITCHAT

It's like very similar.	O
With like 'cause he has a friend that also has a gold leaf somewhere business card.	O
Yeah, I think this is something that is interesting to me in particular because of make sure you.	O
I.	CHITCHAT
You know, since I do so much work.	CHITCHAT
Specifically for.	CHITCHAT
On my Instagram, that's about and also on my big hands.	CHITCHAT
That's about wearing Flowers, so I wanted to have a pin that kind of represented what I did I could use it as a business part, like I could hand someone this piece and say, like, hey, this is what kind of is representative of my work, so I thought that was kind of useful to have an would be interesting, but it didn't make sense to have the bottom pin.	O
It just I didn't want to just be Flowers because it's not just what I do.	O
I think it's a little bit more about like.	O
Uh, wearables and then the skull was like a easy way to transfer.	O
To pick like a topic or a subject that everyone has a skull, it doesn't.	O
It's generalists.	O
It's not trying to be a specific person, it's just representative representative of all of us.	O
Uhm, you kind of see what that looks like.	O
Right, so I'm actually going to go through the process of designing maybe one or two of these pieces and kind of show you what that would look like when I'm actually doing the design work.	O
I thought that would be kind of handy.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
What you could do so typically I do everything with the actual pen tool so you know I'm just like.	O
Pending things like that.	O
I'm sure you.	CHITCHAT
So what we're going to do is usually I start with a rough sketch of something that I want to make.	O
Over.	CHITCHAT
So let's see how she's going to try and make a pin of something else, let's say of A.	O
A Daisy One way I would start this is by finding a Daisy that I like already, like an image and dragging it in.	O
What they want this white days and doesn't really have to be perfect?	O
The sizing of it not so concerned about that 'cause I'm going to change the sizing later and I'm going to go ahead and trace out the portions of the daily and so now I know that I need the Daisy.	O
I'm not just doing the outline of the Daisy, I'm actually going through and changing the.	O
Making sure that the lines are going to be gold in the inside will be filled with enamel 'cause these are hard enamel pins.	O
So what I'll do temporarily is, I'll just make these as lines.	O
And sometimes I'll have them as gold lines, just so I kind of get a sense if I know that I'm working with gold anyway, it's just really for my own mental like.	O
I guess ability to imagine it.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I don't have to be so precise, because obviously daisies this Daisy has a ton of every imperfection and I'm also not trying to make something that's like Super Geometrical.	O
I'll just try to make something that is.	O
Kind of closed what I want.	O
Z.	CHITCHAT
I also don't give myself too much grief about it if it's not perfect, I can always go back and edit it later like it's just like part of this process.	O
So again, this is all in illustrator.	O
And you can kind of see that there are moments where the pedals kind of look like they fused together, and so I have to be a little bit careful about what I'm building here.	O
To make sure that it stays like a realistic looking Daisy.	O
I'm saying that they also try to be drawn to be perfect, and that's the biggest problem with drawing simplified shape.	O

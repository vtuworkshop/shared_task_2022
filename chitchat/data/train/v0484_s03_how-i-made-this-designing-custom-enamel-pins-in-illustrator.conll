Yeah, it's really hard because I think a lot of times we only see the completed outcome, which looks so beautiful and perfect that it's hard to imagine and all.	O
Of when it's just.	O
Kind of clunky looking.	O
That's why I think it's kind of nice to look at other peoples incomplete files so that you learn like, Oh yeah, it's not always that nice like I think a lot of people see the finished pin.	O
For example, in our like, Oh, it's perfect.	O
It looks like how did you get it so clean?	O
But the you can tell even from what I'm doing here, that it's actually not as clean.	O
It would look.	CHITCHAT
Oh hi Sir.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Hold on for saying that.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad that you like the broadcast.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I think there's some really amazing people who are large streaming on Behance like I just like watch them for fun, especially the painters.	O
If you ever have the luxury of watching like one of the painters work, I think Mattie bellower is a good example of that where she's doing digital painting.	O
It's very mesmerizing to watch.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And there are also times where I just like kind of skip.	O
Sections where I'm like it doesn't really quite fit the exact image of a Daisy I'm looking at.	O
I think the other thing that is kind of concerning is a lot of people feel like they have to master pen tool completely before they can do something like this.	O
An I'm 1st to tell them like I'm not good at the pen tool.	O
I just like kind of futz around until.	O
I get something that looks nice and then sometimes I look at what I make and I hate it.	O
But it's part of the process.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
What's nice about this particular it easy?	O
And it's maybe I chose the right starting point pedal is that I just have to kind of work around it and not worry too much about.	O
With the petals are all overlapping in the same direction ish?	O
But I will work front to back.	O
So that like I'll pick up.	O
When I get to that pedal, pick the one that's in the front first or I should do one that's in the back so it's not always in the precise order.	O
I think it takes also a little bit of trial and error to know what looks good on a pin like there are some moments where the gap is you need like a significant enough gap between objects for the pin like between the gold line for the pin to look good, and so there's a little bit of like you order a you realize.	O
Oh like, I actually lost a lot of detail this way.	O
Or you know, these gold lines were too.	O
Close together so it didn't really make sense.	O
I didn't need to make it like that.	O
But you can read like 1000 articles on it, but it's way easier to just look at it in real life after you ordered a pin.	O
Alright, what I'm also doing here is I'm not worrying too much about the colours.	O
Obviously, like I said, the gold is good for me to kind of focus on what the final outcome will be is just like a mental thing, not so much like a.	O
Choice that will matter because the factory actually is not that concerned with what color I'm giving them.	O
For the lines, there are more concerned about the actual vectoring of the object, so you don't have to be so worried about.	O
This one.	CHITCHAT
Take the pedal.	O
I don't like how it got dropped off there.	O
Oh no.	CHITCHAT
OK then this one.	CHITCHAT

They don't have a strong feeling about it, but I think.	O
As of course, of being a designer, you know we care that.	O
The file looks.	O
Like what we're going to present to them.	O
He said.	CHITCHAT
And then what I'll do is I'll fill the inside of this.	O
What I wanted.	CHITCHAT
What I want.	CHITCHAT
Goodnight Wait, what I was expecting would happen.	CHITCHAT
But that ever happened to you guys where you guys are working in illustrator and you're like that's not what I thought it would do.	O
And I'm sure there's a way to do the thing.	O
But whichever way you've chosen to do it is not the right place.	O
Let's try this.	CHITCHAT
Please.	CHITCHAT
Search Another thing we could do instead is too.	CHITCHAT
There it is.	CHITCHAT
Outline the stroke so we could just outline the stroke and then merge the objects and then delete.	O
The inside of the objects.	O
Like so.	CHITCHAT
I was like I knew there's a easier way to do this.	O
Haha, OK now I have a filled object and there are some things I can stop and eat.	O
OK, that looks good.	CHITCHAT
And then we'll go ahead and make this white.	O
What's nice is that disease come in a bunch of different colors.	O
See, this is.	CHITCHAT
Why does it have that?	CHITCHAT
We see those stories, people ships, we gotta go.	O
Almost Seven days to back.	O
And that was selected.	O
Making delete this thing.	O
My little monstrosity, mean group the lines and then we can take this and align it.	O
Great.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There's a filled easy for us, and then we'll take this and so will take.	O
Back out of these layers, right?	O
We have the centerpiece and we're going to pick a yellow.	O
A nice bright yellow.	O
Back So OK, so obviously these are.	O
This is way too big for this pin, so I'm going to go ahead and scale it down.	O
And as you scale it down you can kind of see all the weight disappeared because the outlines of this are too sick.	O
But that's OK because we can make it down to one.	O
Or even better, we can actually go ahead and check what the thickness of these lines were, so that we know what the select.	O
She's already outlined.	O
OK, it is one.	CHITCHAT
It's one point.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and rags over.	O
And scaling.	O
OK, so I know that I'm going to need something that's similar to this arch board so I can go ahead and drive it up here because I'm going to want it to match the the existing skull.	O

Up Um?	CHITCHAT
See.	CHITCHAT
Well, we could do is just say, OK, let's abandoned.	O
The zigzag will just make daisies as they are with circles.	O
That simple shapes in circles.	O
At work.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Will make a few that only have a few pedals instead of every single one of them.	O
Having like 30 pedals will make a few that.	O
Kinda make more sense.	O
Uh, for John is asking what are the shortcuts that reduce the effects with scale?	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I'm just typically not thinking about scale too well.	CHITCHAT
I probably should have just started with an easier scale of objects.	O
Instead of trying to make something really big and then scale it down, almost having a hard time because the insides aren't filled.	O
Whereas like if I filled, I could hold just grab it.	O
Scrabble of this.	O
One by one.	O
And then into the back.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
'cause this is always have a slightly elliptical shape, right?	O
Not just in the middle, but to the way it's not a perfect circle 1 circle inside of the other, so we're considering that when we build out this particular Daisy.	O
And then scaling it down.	O
See, it never looks quite as good if I don't pull it from reference.	O
It's just like more obviously not a Daisy shape, so I feel like I should have pulled that same reference, but.	O
With smaller pedals to kind of fix it, but it's OK, alright?	O
Sure, you at least what that looks like.	O
OK, so if I were to try to send this to A.	O
Please.	CHITCHAT
If I were to try to send it to them, I will probably group this and then I would add an effect.	O
I don't even know if I need to add a add an effect.	O
It's OK if it's just like that size and then I could just go ahead and give.	O
This Pantone Swatch.	O
You know that will need white and then the inside we can go ahead and take this hex color an all off and go into a Web Hex color.	O
So let's say hex to Pandora.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
It turns out that there's something called yellow.	O
See that looks almost exactly let me take a screenshot and show you really quick.	O
So here are the all the options that the generator I just I just literally will Google Hex to Pantone and.	O
And this is what it came up with for yellow for the yellow that's closest to that.	O
and I felt like this yellow see felt pretty good.	O

So these are factories that you would find in typically in China.	CHITCHAT
There are other places to find, but they're actually no pin factories in America.	CHITCHAT
I actually made a big concerted effort to look and this is something that just doesn't exist because it's it's hard for us to do manufacturing out in large scale here and pins typically the way that pins are made is that.	O
They the mold is what costs you money, so the more pins like making a ton of pins at once doesn't make a big difference.	O
What really matters is that you have a mold of the pin in that mold is costs money because it's handcrafted like somebody cars that with that mold looks like and then shows like the machine how to fill in the mold in a specific way.	O
But once you have the mold you can just make.	O
A lot of them, and then it's just the material cost.	O
It doesn't cost them anymore like it's not a significant ad in terms of like time and factory consumption, at least from what I understand, and so here, this is just like what it kind of looks like.	O
They'll say OK, here is the quantity for 100 of these will be about an inch.	O
Here's what the materials are.	O
There's hard enamel and soft enamel and the pin back you can ask for different kinds like they can be silver to match whatever metal you have.	O
Or they could be plastic and some are really nice like screw on ones in the back.	O
You can't really tell here.	CHITCHAT
I mean, there's no way you can see this is the thing, but it says Botanica new which is my company name for my little else.	O
And it's just so that if someone was like to lose a spending, at least in some picked it up, they could be like, oh, I know where they got the pin from, so that cost more money to have my name printed on the back.	O
And then you can see that the mold charge is what costs me the money.	O
So it cost me $70.00 to make one mold of this piece.	O
And then each individual piece created after you've made the mold is $0.48, so it behooves you to not make a ton of different mole, like a ton of different like what I essentially did with making three different sets of the top was I made myself very poor.	O
It would be more effective to make 1 pin and just make a lot of the same pin.	O
If you're looking purely for cost effective savings.	O
Which I always think is interesting.	CHITCHAT
And then so he'll give me the price for each of these, and then he will tell me how much the cost total cost is.	O
And then I pay them in half, so I pay half of the cost up front, and then they'll pay when the pins are completed and they give, they show me a photo of proof of it.	O
I pay them the second half and they ship it to me.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Let me show you what it looks like when they talk to me OK, and so this is what the.	O
Just taking screenshots for ease of use here, but this is what it looks like for the actual.	O
Conversation with the.	O
The factory this is what they sent back to me, so they took my design.	O
They checked it through their designer so they have someone in-house making sure and they give me exact millimeter sizes and also where the pin will be placed in the back.	O
I probably could have been more precise about where I wanted these pins.	O
The actual backing, like gold pins to be, but I didn't really care and I think that's actually why they kind of tend to spin a little bit is that I didn't really carefully consider the weight of the pin and so.	O
The pen tends to just kind of roll around.	O
If I could do it again, I would do it better.	O
Um thing kind of see three options that are here for that front and back.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
The production time for this is very short.	O
It's about like 2 weeks.	O
Three weeks total of production and then they'll send me something that looks.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
Photo.	O
Looks like this.	CHITCHAT
So then they'll say, OK.	O
Here's a proof.	O
And that's when I would send them a second.	O
Half of my payment I just thought it's kind of interesting because on line there's not a ton of resources.	O

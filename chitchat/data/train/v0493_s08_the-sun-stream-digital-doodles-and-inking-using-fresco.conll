The first ad that popped in my head were those so famous cartoon downs.	CHITCHAT
I'll tell you what.	CHITCHAT
Say I can't voice acting there.	CHITCHAT
How's the way OK?	CHITCHAT
So when it comes to freelance stuff?	CHITCHAT
Not to Pat myself on the back, but I'm pretty good at when someone describes to me what they want to get it the first time out of the game I usually drop people a picture like a quick sketch.	CHITCHAT
You give it to him and then go like Oh my God, I love it.	CHITCHAT
Let's do this and then like you know, invoices happen when I when it doesn't happen the first time out.	CHITCHAT
It's a me thing.	CHITCHAT
I get frustrated and I'm just like, oh.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to work, you know, and work on those anymore 'cause I didn't get the first time and I have to get that out of my head.	CHITCHAT
That's a narcissistic thing to think about, like Oh, I'm supposed to get it the first time out.	CHITCHAT
And then people get.	CHITCHAT
They worry that I'm getting upset because some people can be very very very, very picky an I have to remind them it's fine.	CHITCHAT
Be picky, it's your money.	CHITCHAT
You knew you need to like.	CHITCHAT
I'm like a Burger King, you get your way right.	CHITCHAT
You're not happy that reflects on me when the chance thank you so much for the follows.	CHITCHAT
Who appreciate it?	CHITCHAT
Hold on where Steve Carell says thanks for the follow.	CHITCHAT
In Britain.	CHITCHAT
I am a Wendy's.	CHITCHAT
I love you, pay me and you get what you want if you're not satisfied then.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to do a money back guarantee, so I'm going to make it good until you like it.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
'cause I got bills to pay.	CHITCHAT
It ain't no money back guarantee or not anything you know money back and are going on now.	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to do this until you're happy, but again, there is a line right.	CHITCHAT
There has to be a line hey Joe, long time no see how you doing Joe.	CHITCHAT
Really, I just had my first 2 clients.	CHITCHAT
It's a process to go understand people search.	CHITCHAT
Your customer is always right.	CHITCHAT
If you offer a service, no matter how big or small.	CHITCHAT
Yes, because your reputation, especially if you're new.	CHITCHAT
If you are new to something then.	CHITCHAT
It's it's.	CHITCHAT
You have to understand what.	CHITCHAT
Do you know?	CHITCHAT
Pleasing the customer but also like standing up for yourself at the same time, you don't want to take it.	CHITCHAT
Be taken advantage of two, right?	CHITCHAT
So if you just had your first year clients like.	CHITCHAT
That sometimes when your new the tendency is to charge little because you have to break into the industry.	CHITCHAT
I think that's Pardon my French Adobe, but that's where shot OK.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
The things that you just showed me on your be hands.	CHITCHAT
It's really awesome work.	CHITCHAT
You have incredible work now.	CHITCHAT
No that worth because they're coming to you for something that they cannot do themselves right.	CHITCHAT
People will pay money up for something good.	CHITCHAT
If they can't do it themselves.	CHITCHAT
That's why auntie restaurants like Morton's and I don't know Taco Bell like Taco Bell.	CHITCHAT
Those phases exist because people are too lazy to do it themselves, or they don't want to.	CHITCHAT
You know, they don't have their ingredients, certainly don't have the skills to do it, so you know your worth.	CHITCHAT
But at the same time don't like if a client.	CHITCHAT
Is unhappy with the things that are coming to fruition.	CHITCHAT
Then you know you have to kind of compromise.	CHITCHAT
You have to, you know, aim to.	CHITCHAT
Please please tame that sort of thing.	CHITCHAT
That's how that's my, that's my deal.	CHITCHAT
It's like a tricky kind of thing to kind of figure out for yourself.	CHITCHAT
His whole romanticized idea of like starving artists and you have to suffer for your art and you have to pay your dues.	CHITCHAT

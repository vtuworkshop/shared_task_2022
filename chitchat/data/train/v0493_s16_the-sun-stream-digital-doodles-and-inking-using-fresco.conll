I'm trying right here.	CHITCHAT
Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?	CHITCHAT
How's it going to draw?	CHITCHAT
Do Pickles Tommy Pickles down from Rugrats.	CHITCHAT
That was like my favorite show.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
On Nickelodeon.	CHITCHAT
There I say better than running Stimpy.	CHITCHAT
The thing about running stimpy, they only had so many episodes they didn't do a whole lot of having South experiment.	CHITCHAT
For some reason, like came to fruition.	CHITCHAT
So they kept on repeating the same episodes over and over and over again.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I'm looking at a reference by the way.	CHITCHAT
For Homer Simpson like Bart Simpson, I can draw from memory.	CHITCHAT
That's sort of like a pattern, but like more than like Hank Hill, I have to look at the picture.	CHITCHAT
There's nothing wrong with that at all.	CHITCHAT
I think they kept going with sponge Bob like The Simpsons that I don't know.	CHITCHAT
But it is anymore to be honest.	CHITCHAT
I saw watching since the season 14.	CHITCHAT
Typical is garden.	CHITCHAT
Get that too.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's good.	CHITCHAT
He's a great time.	CHITCHAT
All of the dad's an Rugrats.	CHITCHAT
Like, Uh?	CHITCHAT
Oh my God was telling his best friends last time, Is It?	CHITCHAT
Chuckie Chuckie Chuckie's tab.	CHITCHAT
Like they had that hook, they had that whole again.	CHITCHAT
There's outside or chuckies mom left.	CHITCHAT
And then they had to explain that to Chuckie.	CHITCHAT
Chuckie never understood why.	CHITCHAT
And like him and his dad has if I come to terms with like you know.	CHITCHAT
Check these mom's like leaving.	CHITCHAT
We know she.	CHITCHAT
I think she passed away.	CHITCHAT
And check you couldn't understand that.	CHITCHAT
And then he finally did.	CHITCHAT
They kind of accepted it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, she passed away.	CHITCHAT
That was that hurt.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
And then they try to do like them in like high school or middle school.	CHITCHAT
and I was like about now, I don't care about that.	CHITCHAT
I don't care about that show and let them as babies.	CHITCHAT
It's not gonna work, is not gonna work.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Dallas, Adam.	CHITCHAT
Like man Then checking realize that, like hold my mom's in Heaven and the way that, like Chucky, is Chucky talks like he said I am Oh my God, I broke my heart OG.	CHITCHAT
Oh Sometimes cartoons back then, like they could be pretty happy.	CHITCHAT
It actually really, really intense issues like you can't sugar ship that you cannot sugarcoat things anymore for kids, especially when you have things like You Tube and and all this other stuff, things like YouTube and watching Ted talks and all these like influencers, and they're doing these like some of that sometimes are doing some pretty stupid stuff and you don't have to explain this to kids.	CHITCHAT
So I just I appreciate shows that that like Sesame Street, Sesame Street is extremely progressive.	CHITCHAT
It's over even for like back in the day they showed a lot of different things.	CHITCHAT

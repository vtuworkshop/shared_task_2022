Mr Rogers.	CHITCHAT
Mr Rogers neighborhood, super progressive, like holy crap.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think people taught and people like like forget to talk about stuff like that like the issues that they tackle.	CHITCHAT
I love Sesame Street.	CHITCHAT
I still remember when Snuffaluffagus was still pretend and no one ever believed.	CHITCHAT
Big bird that snuffaluffagus Israel that always big birds like imaginary friend.	CHITCHAT
Until like eventually the big reveal happen and it's like holy crap.	CHITCHAT
And as a kid I was like how could you not notice?	CHITCHAT
And it's a big elephant looking thing in strictly.	CHITCHAT
If you missed him every single time, like seriously huge like him, he's literally a mammoth like brow you can, you know you don't get that you don't see him.	CHITCHAT
You guys are done.	CHITCHAT
Other dumb Yeah, this is a crab.	CHITCHAT
Steven universe marvels passed away very real cartoon in my opinion.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I heard Steven Universe like has like since its main now it deals with things like very very effectively when it was back then like they kind of like I don't know.	CHITCHAT
There is still a stigma that cartoons were cartoons and then they couldn't.	CHITCHAT
That kids couldn't handle real world issues but.	CHITCHAT
Shows like Sesame Street and Mr Rogers neighborhood just made it matter of fact, which I I.	CHITCHAT
Thought was freaking genius and.	CHITCHAT
Shows like Steven Universe, where it's built, its core storyline is built around like you know.	CHITCHAT
You know, sometimes really big issues then.	CHITCHAT
It normalizes it and I think that makes the show more relevant now than say if it was done.	CHITCHAT
You know, 10 years ago it was in 10 years ago.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how well it would be perceived.	CHITCHAT
It's not for love.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it was the biggest number ever.	CHITCHAT
Yes, Sesame Street.	CHITCHAT
Anything on racism in response to everything.	CHITCHAT
Yep, it did.	CHITCHAT
When I was a kid, it exposed me to a lot of things that I didn't understand.	CHITCHAT
And they tried to normalize things like racism.	CHITCHAT
You know things like sexuality, things like breastfeeding.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
It was very very inclusive.	CHITCHAT
And as a kid.	CHITCHAT
I think I think also because I was born in a household where you know I was exposed to a lot of different things and I was brought up in the neighborhood.	CHITCHAT
That was very, very not very diverse, but.	CHITCHAT
I was I was very open to it and then me watching Sesame Street and Mr Rogers neighborhood.	CHITCHAT
I was just like wow like it made me feel like oh this stuff is normal.	CHITCHAT
You know this stuff is rain.	CHITCHAT
Not a lot of people.	CHITCHAT
Acknowledge Sesame Street.	CHITCHAT
For the things that it's done.	CHITCHAT
Done a lot of stuff, a lot of stuff.	CHITCHAT
In its most effective, because you know what you know, how you can do the greatest change teaching when you teach kids when they were younger.	CHITCHAT
How to accept people?	CHITCHAT
That makes the world of difference.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to change adults without an adult, so stubborn and stupid, changing the mind and heart of a kid.	CHITCHAT
Sets them up for greater things later on in life.	CHITCHAT
That's why I hate arguing online.	CHITCHAT
I hate arguing online.	CHITCHAT
You didn't get Sesame Street tank.	CHITCHAT
I think these are going to be better than us.	CHITCHAT
They're getting better social stuff from cartoons.	CHITCHAT
LGB stuff like choices and so on and so forth.	CHITCHAT
Adventure Time and Steven Universe at some good stuff.	CHITCHAT
I agree.	CHITCHAT
I actually.	CHITCHAT
I agree a lot.	CHITCHAT
Watching things like that I will like normalizes that.	CHITCHAT
I stopped watching Sesame Street.	CHITCHAT

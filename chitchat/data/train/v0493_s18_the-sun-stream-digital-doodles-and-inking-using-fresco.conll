You know 'cause I grow up?	CHITCHAT
If I ever have kids, I'm really hoping that PBS is stopping running.	CHITCHAT
I remember the pledge drive is just to keep it going and I can.	CHITCHAT
That used to be a failure and look, it is not a thing anymore.	CHITCHAT
I don't hear about it like I hope that they're doing OK.	CHITCHAT
Nice lines who thank you.	CHITCHAT
And so this is where my of Queerness and Steven Universe.	CHITCHAT
I've seen like what I seen one season of it.	CHITCHAT
I've never watched the rest of it.	CHITCHAT
But When it first came out.	CHITCHAT
I just heard of it as being a good show.	CHITCHAT
And then later on I would hear about like Oh it.	CHITCHAT
It has a lot of like LG BT Q.	CHITCHAT
BECU like representations that has a lot of like.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Lot of stories.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking.	CHITCHAT
There's not a lot like negative buzz around it.	CHITCHAT
And that made me feel very, very grateful.	CHITCHAT
'cause?	CHITCHAT
I grew up where?	CHITCHAT
I did.	CHITCHAT
2.	CHITCHAT
I will go.	CHITCHAT
OK, I watched it for from the relation I got about his relationships and expiration is amazing.	CHITCHAT
I know a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Make a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Communities have really praised it.	CHITCHAT
A lot of communities of plays praise it because it talks about like relationships and you don't necessarily see that in major media You really don't.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It was not like I was saying before.	CHITCHAT
When Ellen came out as being gay.	CHITCHAT
Being a gay woman, it cancel her show.	CHITCHAT
That was a huge deal back then.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of backlash when that was in the early 90s.	CHITCHAT
I want to say.	CHITCHAT
And this then to think like 10 years later.	CHITCHAT
Like Having shows like Adventure Time like Steven Universe and it being more open about it.	CHITCHAT
I think has helped as kind of like you know, again normalized and made it more accepting, especially to a younger audience and.	CHITCHAT
I really do believe that is because of the generations each generation has become more and more accepting about it, and I think the problem when it comes to like online fighting and stuff like that is like you're trying to convince old people of old things and.	CHITCHAT
I would rather like kind of preach to younger people and have them because it will become the next generation and next generation the next generation.	CHITCHAT
You know, like I want like when I have kids.	CHITCHAT
If I have kids I don't know.	CHITCHAT
People aren't having kids nowadays.	CHITCHAT
When I if I ever become apparent I wanna install to them being open and loving.	CHITCHAT
Accepting who you are expecting other people you know I think generation by generation were kind of phasing a lot of that homophobia.	CHITCHAT
And like racism out, it's going to take a lot of time by things like you have to teach the younger in order to be able to.	CHITCHAT
Improve like society and using mediums like art right like art and cartoons and comics and things like that.	CHITCHAT
I think that was just extremely important.	CHITCHAT
We get little love for Gravity Falls too.	CHITCHAT
I've never.	CHITCHAT
I've heard about that show, but I've never actually watched it.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I learned about Steven Universe because of a T-shirt contest that I that I I.	CHITCHAT
Became part of.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Since like I need reference to draw it, I watched like the first season housing it's pretty OK, it's pretty good.	CHITCHAT

'cause this is strictly black-and-white, crosshatching?	O
Yeah, this is strictly black-and-white there.	CHITCHAT
Well, if there's some like I think he did ink wash for the background.	O
The character himself is strictly banned in White the way that he does, like the Chrome Chrome gradations within within the form is through cross hatching, and that's what I'm trying to learn.	O
And it's a very.	O
It's straightforward but yet very subtle and complicated.	O
And I've been trying to look for videos on try like trying to break it down how people trying to do.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of tough tough trying to find tutorials on how to do this stuff, so I try to learn by imitation.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Just knowing.	CHITCHAT
How?	CHITCHAT
Like Just the head itself.	O
Like what decisions were made like, why didn't you just do that whole thing black and then the little crosshatches like you know right here.	O
By the standards, he does crosshatching over and over, and then he reiterates some areas but not others.	O
So it's sort of like a design with just cross hatching.	O
The beautiful thing.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful, beautiful.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, tomorrow will be looking accurate.	CHITCHAT
Auriemma, which, coincidentally of what I've seen, doesn't.	CHITCHAT
He was a whole lot of crosshatching, so maybe me doing some of that might inspire me.	CHITCHAT
Go like, hey, maybe I don't have to like focus so heavily on cross hatching.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I could be a more simplistic style, but we'll talk about more of that tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I get really freaking dirty when it comes like especially video game art.	CHITCHAT
Because I.	CHITCHAT
Have some knowledge and I could never go off tangent, especially on series.	CHITCHAT
Um FF theory is like tack in Street Fighter or things like that.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of Capcom artists that I really look up to like bengas like they've.	CHITCHAT
Early I'd say no well mid 90s to 2000s is like when they had like Dark Stalkers and Marvel versus Capcom Two and like those artists that did the concept for that many feet.	CHITCHAT
I get an art boner by like like looking at that art and I have the art books to show it.	CHITCHAT
I could, you know, I might actually do this.	CHITCHAT
I get set up a Cam above me and I could take the art books that I have and I could show it off.	CHITCHAT
It's just all men.	CHITCHAT
The art that they've done that Capcom, SN, K people that did well asking other people to King of fighters.	CHITCHAT
Capcom, SNK, Conomie Art back in the day.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, people that did Metal Gear Solid oh so God Oh my God so good.	CHITCHAT
So yeah we'll talk about that tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I'll talk about that tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
Like six o'clock 6:00 o'clock Pacific Standard Time.	CHITCHAT
Alright, if you're interested in like being exposed to the art that I dig, then you know.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to stop by.	CHITCHAT
Also, like if there's artist that you like how you think that I would art vote.	CHITCHAT
It's not a bad thing, right?	CHITCHAT
It's not like a bad word.	CHITCHAT
Havenaar boner.	CHITCHAT
But did you see me like how I went into like this whole rant about like many fake?	CHITCHAT
There's like so many good artists out there.	CHITCHAT
So many good artist artist that you guys are like, really, really into really have a passion for and you know you want to share.	CHITCHAT

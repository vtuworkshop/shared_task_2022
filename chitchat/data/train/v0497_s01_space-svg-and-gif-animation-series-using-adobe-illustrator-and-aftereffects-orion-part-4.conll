Whole bunch of performance.	O
Aside from that just kind of isn't playing it, but we also took it out of illustrator as an SVG and hand wrote the CSS animation for.	O
So that's been the process.	O
All alarms basically making these illustrations in illustrator, exporting them out and then animate them two different ways.	O
So we started with the space, just the constellations.	O
Here is our and before from.	O
After facts analysis, the SPG that we did so basically forever.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Fancy SVG, so there you can see that they're pretty much the same animation.	O
Just two different ways, and then we moved on to the dog goes.	O
We did the Canis Major and minor slip previous one was the illustrations in the northern hemisphere.	O
Stars kind of rotating with the seasons.	O
Ended up.	O
Two specific constellations, we're Canis Major and minor in this.	O
This one here.	CHITCHAT
So you see similar backdrop for the consultations with slightly different right started getting do these specific ones.	O
Here we do the two dogs, so representing the mythology of the cloud solutions came as major and painless liner.	O
Do you wanna do something similar with Orion had the consolation kind of anime on an anime ttev?	O
All of these are designed to be looping animations that kind of loop infinitely, so they started the same.	O
But you see, we're doing the same kind of thing.	O
Got some secondary.	O
We're gonna have some secondary motion in.	O
The Ryan Illustration and then we're going to have that in that.	O
Consolation anime or not, so this will route.	O
We ended up adding a whole bunch of stuff to this illustration, so take a little bit longer 'cause it's much more detail.	O
That's OK.	CHITCHAT
I think we have a good time and then we allow your conversation it stay in the chat.	O
So if you guys do you have more questions, let me know and I will try to answer them.	O
I also realized yesterday after we entered the street and I almost totally forgot to add the.	O
Little wrench inherently want that, so Jerry full saying, did you know that Orion was also known as Osiris?	O
I feel like yeah, there's a whole bunch of different names and mythology's Ferrari.	O
I.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so this is again a.	CHITCHAT
Um murder outside.	CHITCHAT
Resurrected as the constellation appears.	O
She had a painting on the, UM, Smith.	O
That you follow, there's a couple of different ones, so maybe I didn't know about this.	O
He gets like flying it.	O
I think in this mythology or whatever, and he has to like.	O
Roam the earth or something every couple of these I remember reading about how, um, Orion's myth is also tide somehow too.	O
The sun God.	O
And how he gets blinded in like have to like he's a Hunter and it's blinded.	O
Because he.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Angers the gods I don't remember.	O
I don't remember.	CHITCHAT
Somebody has a better understanding of all varieties of Orion Smiths.	O
Please let me know.	CHITCHAT
Because they are kind of hazy in my mind, but in general the idea with the right is that.	O
Will always miss our religious meant to help you remember the.	O
Constellations in the Sky, right?	O
Or the constellations are just not causation itself, just day to help you remember the.	O
The important navigational stars in the Sky, right?	O
So you can be able to identify the stars and sort of use that to navigate so.	O
And stories we talked about this before are really great at helping.	O
That information, like.	O
Stick in your mind so, um.	O
Yes, so Orion Smith is that uses Hunter up and he's got his two hunting dogs.	O
Canis major, major, major and minor available dogs that we've illustrated already.	O
The hair, which is what they're hunting and then part Hunter Orion and he gets stung by Scorpion.	O

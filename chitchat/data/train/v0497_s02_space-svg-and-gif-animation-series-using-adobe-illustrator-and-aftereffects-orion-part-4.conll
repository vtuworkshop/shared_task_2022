Sent by the gods generally because Orion is really arrogant in vain, and they for a variety of reasons.	O
Depending on your myth, anger of the gods and they send the scorpion.	O
So Angela Assumption.	O
So we've got field juice and Rigel two major stars.	O
He is holding a club and they hide or shield depending on your pending on the depiction.	O
I think later later depictions of Orion change this from the animal hides in the shield, but in general it's either animal hydroshield and definitely always a club.	O
I think there's a misconception that.	O
It's an arrow like a bow and arrow, and that's not the case.	O
Uh, there is an Archer, Sagittarius, which is a different uhm consolation.	O
I believe it's talked about sports the Teapot If you are in Australia, but it's that's the furniture in this guy is serious.	O
Nick is Nick is saying something after a proof is there we go naked saying the Greek version was that he was the child of the side and he was really cocky and basically wanted to kill one of everything that I got super mad and Sun Scorpio after him.	O
Yeah I think yes that is one of the myths.	O
There's another myth where they blind him instead of poisoned him and he has any acylate get his sight restored or something.	O
My name is Jeff.	CHITCHAT
Would say one thing.	CHITCHAT
My father did give me was an appreciation of astronomy.	CHITCHAT
Well then this is perfect for uhm.	CHITCHAT
Father's Day so would dedicate this.	CHITCHAT
Your father gently pull all that's my dad, your dad course.	CHITCHAT
Then everybody's ads so.	CHITCHAT
General saying really, huh?	CHITCHAT
That's something I did not know.	CHITCHAT
It's a shield in club.	O
Yeah, it's not actually was not holding a phone like that's a.	CHITCHAT
Misconception.	CHITCHAT
And I don't really know when it started.	CHITCHAT
What is, as far as I've, as far as I know, it's been always of some kind of variation of a club or a blunt force weapon.	CHITCHAT
And a Hydra shield.	O
And so we're kind of back to the illustration working on what kind of working off of that idea here right with the tether.	O
Zoom lens you cannot Add all see what is happening.	O
So we got this tether.	O
An fresh cake was not chat yesterday suggested we had these ports so this port we got support where the tether attaches and it's going Kayla frame and wrapping around making this nice composition and going back to Dial International Space Station right?	O
And we're going to work on that say started that yesterday with this kind of solar panels.	O
And we're going to keep that relatively simple, and then so that represents kind of the shield idea, and it's also kind of ties into like safety, safety line.	O
Or, you know, I think it relates really nicely to the shield idea.	O
And we've got a ranch in the other hand, shout out to Corey for that suggestion.	O
Something to represent the club is holding an it.	O
It's basically tool, right?	CHITCHAT
So there we go and we probably have to put like a little line to this as well.	O
Make sure you keep your brunch stashed you when you're in space, so.	O
But I think we're going to start with the.	O
International Space Station.	O
That's OK with everybody and we're going to work on that.	O
The wrench and then we still have to add a Patch out of this.	O
This suggestion was a puppy.	CHITCHAT
Let me know.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if that's still the consensus.	O
That is what we want the Patch to be.	O
On our spaceman so.	O
I have pulled up just at the top of my screen where I'm looking.	O
This Google search of the International Space Station just so I can sort of get, I can be looking at it as I'm kind of laying out the pieces and parts here and making sure that I have everything way kind of generally looks.	O
So yeah, let me ask any questions about what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
If you go along here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start.	CHITCHAT
Working And stop talking now so.	CHITCHAT
One thing I notice right away that Miss Yesterday that these solar panels actually just have.	O
Just right along the edges of this.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Shape here.	O
Z.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT

Hola, let me know if I'm pronouncing that correctly.	CHITCHAT
Uh, since I'm new here, doesn't sketches.	CHITCHAT

If you go back through I believe that I maybe did some of the sketching.	O
Earlier videos there's a lot of videos.	CHITCHAT
Uh, but you can also watch.	CHITCHAT
I did um in the replays of video.	CHITCHAT
And where I did a sketch, I did a whole the whole thing in Frisco.	O
If you wanted to look and see for a little bit of my process.	O
There, uhm, so many people joining the chat.	CHITCHAT
I can show you I'm kinda go over uhm how I made the sketches.	O
If you guys are interested I'll just hide all of this stuff and just shows sketches really quickly.	O

Let me get on through.	CHITCHAT
Switch on my camera.	O
To me.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so now you can see my centriq Here, Uhm?	O
And what I do, I have a santikos when I work on, uh, what I'm doing?	O
Any kind sketching in illustrator?	O
Almost every time, and there's a little bit of lag between me switching.	O
Everything so, um, I have set up this brush, but if I set up a new brush I'm here.	O
Like I'm working from scratch, we switch this if you so you guys can see actually everything that's going on.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
This is my field is small, but it's probably more important to see what's going on my screen.	O
So if I make a new brush here, I just use the settings.	O
You can customize all of these, but if you have a a tablet you can use pressure pressure sensitivity.	O
My pen has this like little.	O
And on it, that is a kind of moved to hard pressed, so I am using that to draw the lines and I have just set the sensitivity.	O
She followed the pressure.	O
So I can draw on when I was little bit yesterday, I can grow aligns meals to get figuring center as we go.	O
Overlapped.	O

Well, uh, stuff open have a lot of windows up on the top of my screen as well so.	O
That's basically how I did all of the sketching for these guys.	O
They're not like super perfect or anything like that.	O
Why did these?	CHITCHAT
I drew the lines and then I kind of manipulate these points to be sort of like.	O
More rectangles must squiggly lines not I mean I like I, I just kind of move the points around to make them.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking for it, but I just group this this shape and copied it and pasted it and kind of having following this line.	O
Basically the lines with the ISS and I just sketched just looking.	O
I have just a Google search up here.	CHITCHAT
I'm not following anyone particular image of life at this one pulled up.	O
I'm just looking at the general shape of the ISS and sort of what are the main components.	O
We're not going to details with us and that's that's why I use.	O
I just basically drink my some teeth.	O
This this guy here a little hot tip, but you may not know about.	O
Switch back.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
He lies.	CHITCHAT
A hot tip that you uhm.	CHITCHAT
May not know about is this hidden in the brush settings?	O
We double click on your paintbrush tool and I believe pencil so as to you can adjust the Fidelity and for those of you that have ever used fresco this is the equivalent of like the smoothing option, right?	O
So I can bring it all the way down and make it really accurate and that's kind of follow my friend line really closely.	O
So I'm going to get a lot of points when I let go of this.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
So he can see they got a ton of points in there, 'cause it's like really it's following the line really accurately or I can go back in here and I can bring it all the way up if I want the smoothing way up.	O
Like let's say I'm not confident in my hands are shaky so.	O
I can draw someone online and it's going to have fewer points and it's going to be smoother.	O
Then the one above it.	O
So you've got some options for adjusting them there as well.	O
I'm pretty sure it's in just double check.	O
There's a couple of your, um, illustrator tools that you can like double Click to get more options for.	O
I think the grid that I've been using is another one you can double click on to get some options.	O
In the pencil tool, yeah, the pencils who has the same options so.	O
What should I use?	CHITCHAT
I do this a lot.	CHITCHAT
I did this.	CHITCHAT
For the the isometric illustration that we do too, we started blocking everything in using the three tools.	O
The 3D extrude on some shapes just to kind of get the composition, and then I went over those like 3D islands that I made.	O
Essentially those blocks they made it.	O
I drew sort of the buildings that I wanted in all the world details that I want to insert this so.	O
So yeah, um.	CHITCHAT
Can you go?	CHITCHAT
I suppose I could, if you guys did want to see my process from like I could do.	O
We could start another illustration from scratch maybe next week and do the whole process from like sketch all the way through.	O
Sometimes I do like I showed yesterday.	O
I do sometimes draw and keep that line work as a part of my illustration.	O
Just using the lines in Australia.	O
Sorry, I'm trying to navigate to my website so I can show you guys same thing I did yesterday though like dog illustrations, I did um.	O
So the reason why you couldn't keep it, it's just for the sake of this.	O
This is the style that we've been going with her, all of them so far, but I have done like more lying.	O
Languard style illustrations.	O
Before in the past so and you can combine them too with them, pills and everything so.	O
Jennifer is asking what type of some teeth do you have?	O
I think it's it's not like it's not the.	O
Bro.	CHITCHAT
It's just the Centriq 16 inch.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
General six it's like it's the 60 inch if you look up like Wacom Centriq 16 inch.	O
This is what comes up, not the pro version.	O
Just still like straight.	O

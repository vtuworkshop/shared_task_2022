Try and get everything lined up.	O
Alright, so general saying Once you get that first one down things a little bit easier.	O
You can breathe until next piece.	O
Yeah?	CHITCHAT
I mean it's all about sort of like constructing out of Legos, I guess.	O
Sort of building all the pieces and parts up from basic.	O
I use simple shapes.	O
But I mean, uh.	CHITCHAT
Especially in doing this kind of style.	O
So here.	CHITCHAT
How is saying no, not really.	CHITCHAT
I'm new here.	CHITCHAT
We just met.	CHITCHAT
This is really exciting like meeting sketch artists or UI UX or this meal times.	O
I do not own a septic eye.	O
Drop them out.	O
Something wrong with that?	CHITCHAT
If you go back if you watch my like I just said I use a lot of simple.	O
I'm not actually.	CHITCHAT
I'm using a mouse right now bro.	O
I'm not using my centriq.	O
I like using my centriq when I'm doing.	O
Anything that involves, I guess.	O
What's the weather looking for?	CHITCHAT
Signs lines up in thinking at the same time I use my centriq when I'm drawing like.	O
Organic or I need a lot of.	O
I'm sorry my brains like places at once.	CHITCHAT
Heavy metal line worker.	O
I'm trying something like I'm sketching or something like that.	O
But um, in general when I'm doing this kind of illustration, like I don't think I've done aside from the sketch part of this, I haven't really used.	O
I didn't really.	CHITCHAT
I haven't all of these stars and stuff in the background.	O
I use the pen tool foreign.	O
Just same with this guy's all shapes and the pen tool in illustrator.	O
So there are definitely times when I use.	O
Licensee to do stuff, but.	O
It's also just.	CHITCHAT
Another tool I've talked about this kernel before on my stream that.	O
When I was in I got really good at using illustrator when I was in college because my degrees and I have my fachler Fine Arts in medical illustration.	O
And all the other people that I went to school with all had.	O
Their own tablets offender adults would ever and I had used one.	O
It was in studio so I didn't get like I didn't practice as much.	O
Drawing on the tablet essentially as.	O
I guess some of the oceans, so I got really good at.	O
Making art in illustrator.	O
Surprise.	O
I did eventually.	CHITCHAT
I did have a fan I would like bring and use the studio tablet so.	O
Long story short.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Home.	CHITCHAT
She had.	CHITCHAT
The shapes I want and you can do this any any number of ways I'm doing it this way.	O
We've gotten some stuff so.	O
You don't have to, I.	O
There's like the perspective drawing sort tool and elsewhere.	O
But you could use.	O
And these guys are actually more though.	O
This copy paste as isolated selection in the whole, drag it in slightly, doesn't want it to look like this is coming through.	O
Let's see how that works.	CHITCHAT
Wrong one.	CHITCHAT
Also like crazy right now because the guys I have so.	CHITCHAT
Hi.	CHITCHAT
Apply them often moment.	O

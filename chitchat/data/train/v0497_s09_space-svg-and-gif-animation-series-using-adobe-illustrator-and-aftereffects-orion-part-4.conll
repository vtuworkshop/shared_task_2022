So yeah, I'm starting to get nickel weigh threw up again this illustrated here.	O
Again, you friends in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Who rod my frosting at Red Bull rod?	CHITCHAT
Nice to see you if you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
While we're doing, let me know, um, I guess maybe at like maybe like 15 minutes at 5 like halfway through a Golden show.	CHITCHAT
Go through again what we're kind of doing here.	O
Right now we're just working on the.	O
Illustrator part of this so we're not into the actual animation part of things.	O
We will eventually get there, but.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, this illustrations ending up being super complicated so well.	O
Not super complicated, but more complicated with all the parts that were adding an anticipated originally.	O
Jennifer saying no mention of the L word.	O
My husband was round.	O
Please have too many right now.	O
He's got a Lego Yoda very Star Wars galactic ships that would make meeting valves rule no more, no more legos.	O
We have a Lego.	CHITCHAT
I have a Lego Millennium Falcon in my living room, so I should have went out that out for you.	CHITCHAT
Power.	CHITCHAT
I watched you on Adobe EXE challenge Donut app.	O
Yes, um anything goes I was blown away with the technique used to rotate the donut.	O
Really clever.	O
We literally talked about that on the left string.	O
It was so good.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That technique and how I use the cloud chart from illustrator 'cause it's kind of plays into what we're doing with the.	O
SVG animations and I've talked about this before how?	O
The SVG Animations are basically using the position of the points.	O
Well, it's SPG's or whatever are basically representation.	O
When you look at the.	O
Information insider SVG and I'll give you this morning.	O
We have to start animating.	O
You can see that basically every single.	O
Lying in here get to style tag applied to it and what class?	O
It's a class with a style for all of the line and stuff, and then if you look down at the like actual.	O
Classes themselves there basically so this.	O
Front arm one you can scroll through the SVG and you be able to see the like vector coordinate points basically.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
In yesterday.	CHITCHAT
So we do a lot of lines, uh?	O
Lions kills your picture and stars too.	O
Well, we're sorry then with this sketch here.	O
Um, I'm not.	CHITCHAT
Going to keep all of this line work in the final illustration.	O
I just I'm using it as a reference to draw some of this stuff so.	O
We're not going to keep all of this in the final.	O
If you look at some of the previous ones and I have done.	O
4.	CHITCHAT
Other.	CHITCHAT
Animations.	O
And you can see like the dog, one or whatever.	O
So we didn't actually end up keeping all of the.	O
Something those.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
So Paul saying Oh my God.	O

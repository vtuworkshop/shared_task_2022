Like it's following these points all the way around.	O
Versus a regular circle.	O
He just really you try to animate between like a circle and a half circle.	O
You're changing the position and the number of points so it doesn't work as well.	O
Even if you move this point over here and you're like, I'm gonna outsmart, you were going to do it this way, right?	O
It's going to end up happening is that texting trying to move between.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It's going to try and take the shortest path between these two and probably like hold hold us.	O
At this point, instead of like going around your circle, I don't know if that makes sense.	O
If you really interesting that like powers that like I was talking about, you watch that video again, where it kind of go into more detail.	O
You know how I make that animation works, but that's basically the general premise is that that shape is really useful.	O
But it does not offer engine here.	O
That's good.	CHITCHAT
I love the.	CHITCHAT
I like these kinds of a tangent.	CHITCHAT
Exactly conversational.	CHITCHAT
Not animals one.	O
I'm not a developer, I just.	O
Appreciate it like the art.	O
So like I said before, I haven't gotten into the more advanced JavaScript on this stuff.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Message dabbling in it.	O
Sorry, I've got pretty good start to our ISS.	O
Its basic shape of all of the components so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Maybe go back to movies anymore on the chat I had a point I was going to make an Allen's escaped my brain.	O
Omura's point about the lines and stuff.	O
Yeah, so on a similar note nothing to talk about this before, this is just one way you go about doing this.	O
You know, the more that you learn about using illustrator and the more you use it, you're going to find that there's a number of ways to do the same basic tasks.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
It's all about picking sort of the right tool for the job.	O
I'm saying You're trying to accomplish and so this is just where I happened.	O
To land working on this so.	O
Certainly not the only way to do it and.	O
Maybe not even the best way.	O
But it is the way that we have cited.	O
To go with this.	O
Me.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm really bad at remembering which one of those tools is the right one, so.	O

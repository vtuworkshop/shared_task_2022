Riding a bike through an Orange Grove.	O
Kind of like this I guess.	CHITCHAT
And I think she's going to have some oranges in her bike basket up here so.	O
I really like this like it's like yellow bike, but I don't know.	O
We will see I'll be streaming that one as well, but today we're just going to work on the sticker.	O
Uhm, yeah.	CHITCHAT
But this is the I think it's the first time I've drawn this week, so you know, we'll see how that goes.	O
Our.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I I've been working on mostly video stuff this week so I didn't get any like kind of warm up practice in here and.	O
I might try a couple.	O
Yeah, that one was just nothing.	O
I might try a few different designs.	O
Or at least, it's kind of erasing stuff out here.	O
I'm not really sure yet.	CHITCHAT
But we're just going to kind of work through this.	O
This is like very, very beginning stages or I still have a lot of like sketch lines here.	O
And I'm trying to figure out where I want everything to go.	O
But she's looking a little bit younger than I wanted to.	O
She looks like.	CHITCHAT
She saw.	O
Like 12 maybe but.	O
I think it might be because her eyes are really big and maybe the place replacement of the eyes.	O
So we're going to try to.	CHITCHAT
Six that.	O
I might have to just redraw.	O
Um the whole thing, but I'm gonna try to see if I can work with what we have.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT
I think whenever.	O
You make your characters had sorry my phone.	O
If you make your characters have like very short like faces.	O
Like that and then you put their noses here and make their eyes.	O
Really they like this one.	O
It looks like a baby.	O
So we're going to try to.	O
See if we can.	O
Make her a little bit older than.	O
Didn't sketch.	O
And then I'm not sure I was kind of thinking about adding like.	O
From orange glasses, think that could be really cute, divided a think it was last year.	O
I mean the sticker.	O
It was kind of like looking at this one.	O
I don't know if you guys can see it.	O
I can see OK?	O
Yeah, I mean the sticker like last year and I kind of want to go with the same kind of vibe with like the Flowers or like the oranges and stuff.	O
and I really like drawing glasses like that, so I think that could be fun.	O
So I'm just going to play around with this.	O
You guys can ask questions if you want.	O
We can just chat, keep me company while I'm working on this.	O
Figure out how long I want her hair to be.	O
I might give her like a scrunchie or something.	O
So right now I'm just being like super, super messy with this because I'm trying to figure out.	O
Kind of like where I want everything to go.	O
Figuring out like shapes and stuff.	O
It was thunderstorming earlier, so I thought we were going to have some nice thunderstorm ambience in the background, but it stopped.	CHITCHAT
But at least the power hopefully will not go out.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I mean it's not raining at all, so.	CHITCHAT
I doubt that will happen.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if I like this crunchy in her hair.	O
So all of this we are going to go back over.	O
With some cleaner lines, I think just to kind of.	O

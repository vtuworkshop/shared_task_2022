Make it a little more clear what's going on.	O
Yeah, and her eyes are like really big.	O
So I think I'm going to scale goes down a little bit.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, the beginning, um, will be like everything will be saved later on.	O
So you can see the beginning, but I really haven't done very much, so, um.	O
I started out with.	O
A little sketch at first so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I haven't really done too much to it yet, but we're trying to work through and.	O
Figure out what I want the drawing to look like.	O
Just.	CHITCHAT
Let's start over.	CHITCHAT
Can I have her in the background maybe like this?	O
And then, um.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think I might instead of doing like a three quarter view like this.	O
I wanna do Marva.	O
Straight on with you.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
So we're just going to start completely over right now, unless I don't like this and we might go back to the other one.	O
But Always find going back and doing just like.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Portraits like this is easiest for me, and it's a good way to.	O
Get back into drawing after not drawing for a week.	O
Um, last week we started putting a fence up in our backyard.	O
And there are a few days where I didn't.	O
Work at all, so just mostly did.	O
Landscaping stuff That's fine.	O
But I did not draw.	O
So I got all the landscaping done on the front of the House and then.	O
Kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Hung out and did nothing.	CHITCHAT
So they were going to take.	CHITCHAT
I vacation this week and then like this coming week but.	CHITCHAT
Well, it's like.	CHITCHAT
Too short of notice.	CHITCHAT
I guess we're just going to go on like a nature.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Mute my computer OK.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that, but we're going to go on like a little nature trip or something and just stay in a cabin and stay away from everybody.	CHITCHAT
But It's a little late for that.	CHITCHAT
If we were going to go in Monday.	CHITCHAT
His lines are like really throwing me off.	O
And whatever this character ends up looking like, I will be using the same.	O
Character for this the print.	O
'cause this is the sticker for Patriot and and then the print will be a matching print.	O
Need to make sure she doesn't look too similar to the other one that I did.	O
Um, as far as like her facial features.	O
3.	CHITCHAT
Feel like I tend to come.	CHITCHAT
Charles similar faces one.	CHITCHAT
Um, like after doing a break from drawing even though it was only a week.	CHITCHAT

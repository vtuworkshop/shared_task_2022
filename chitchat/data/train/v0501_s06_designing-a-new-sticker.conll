Oh, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
I like to draw when I watch people stream too.	CHITCHAT
It's really relaxing.	CHITCHAT
So I think I'm almost done with the, UM, yes, of figuring out.	CHITCHAT
The like place whenever everything kind of stage and.	O
I'm going to, um, lower the opacity of this and just a second, and we're going to.	O
Start figuring out the lines a little bit more.	O
Making it a little less confusing.	O
To look at.	O
Definitely want to work on these eyes a little bit.	O
But you know, I see my navigator window up here and.	O
Uhm, I like the overall shape.	O
This so far.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So it's kind of.	CHITCHAT
Got this point at the bottom and then we are going to go back and add some.	O
Like I think I want to do some.	O
Please and stuff.	O
Behind are kind of like in this one right here.	O
Or was that one that I saved?	O
Like this one.	CHITCHAT
So that's what I'm going to be looking at.	O
For the background.	O
Just to add a little bit of.	O
Something.	O
Like So it's not just her, so it'll be like.	O
Flowers and oranges and leaves.	O
Just need to figure out placement.	O
And I kind of draw some like random shapes and see how it turns out.	O
See I don't like I did this like randomly and it looks like little cat ears and I don't want that.	O
Not the same.	O
I'm going to look like oranges and Flowers, and I think I might even.	O
You know, put some in her hair.	O
But you cannot kind of watch.	O
You know placement and things like that.	O
You don't want it to.	O
Distract from.	O
The design any.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Pay attention to like little things like that.	O
Yes, I'm gonna have like little oranges back here.	O
It might have made this leaf.	O
Alright, so I think that's fine for now.	O
Will eventually turn those into something.	O
But sometimes even doing like random looking shapes can help you figure out you know.	O
I just have like a lot of scribbles right here, but it's like helping me see that I want something in that area.	O
Not necessarily a squiggle like this.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Kinda helps figure out composition.	O
So we're going to lower the opacity of.	O
Both of these actually.	O
With a little distracting to me, having the like squiggles in the leaves and stuff in the background, and then we're going to.	O
Draw on top of my line layer.	O

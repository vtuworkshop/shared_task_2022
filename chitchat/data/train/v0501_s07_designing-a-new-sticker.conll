I think I'm gonna start out with it.	CHITCHAT
Flipped So we're going to kind of go back and.	O
See if structurally this is.	O
Where I want to go, so I'm just kind of like almost doing.	O
An analysis of my own drawing that I just did just seeing if it.	O
Kind of makes sense.	O
To me, 'cause right here I feel like.	O
This point on her face is kind of like falling this way and then her eyes are more this way.	O
So we want these to line up a little bit more.	O
I'll probably bring this down here and then all.	O
Bring it up.	O
You know, even after I do this one, I might go back and do this.	O
I might do it one more time.	CHITCHAT
Just to make sure.	CHITCHAT
Batman.	O
Come down here and keep in mind perspective.	O
And like when you're drawing and neck, you wanna make sure you don't just kind of do this and then this.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Because like your neck muscles they attached down here like right here.	O
Um, so when you're drawing and if you want to come and do this and then go back here.	O
Um kind of like your.	CHITCHAT
'cause this is this possible comes back down here.	O
So we have this one here and then.	O
This line back here.	O
So you don't want to like have it angled like this.	O
We're just going to have this kind of like soft curved line and then.	O
Of the sun for her shoulders coming back here.	O
And I want it kind of like this.	O
Motion.	O
Because, like I feel like with her eyes looking up this way.	O
Kind of like.	O
He's got.	O
But more of a dynamic, um, kind of.	O
Pose, even though it's like just.	O
A portrait with her face and our shoulders.	O
That adds a certain.	O
Like you know, Contra Pasto kind of thing which is like.	O
Um contrapasso is where?	O
You know you've got a torso kind of going this site and then you have, like hipster going off that way so it has like.	O
A more interesting combination of angles rather than doing like.	O
This is just straight up and down, so I'm kind of doing the same thing with her.	O
Portrait.	O
Even though it's not like full body.	O
But I think that kind of ads.	O
More of a dynamic look to a portrait when you have it.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
Rather than just like straight up and down.	O
I'm also thinking about the.	O
Her.	O
Features and like the direction.	O

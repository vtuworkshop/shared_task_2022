Might have to take a look.	O
Is there a Journal?	O
So I think maybe I moved.	O
This part of her face up a little bit too much whenever I was.	O
Going back to refine some things.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to see, like with her eyes right now, so we've got this one that's more elongated and then this one is more round.	O
So I want to make them have the same kind of feels.	O
Maybe I need to.	CHITCHAT
Come back.	CHITCHAT
To be fine and a wreath out some stuff.	O
and I think in this one we need to.	O
Come here, bring it over this way little bit.	O
And we also like.	O
Whenever you are drawing like the other, I like I like this.	O
I better than this I right now.	O
So what you need to pay attention to is.	O
The different like.	O
Points like structure points.	O
I guess it's like.	O
This little part, like your tear duct and then like what direction this is going in, like how far up this part is compared to the tear duct.	O
And then like where?	CHITCHAT
Where does the I like kind of come to a point appear like?	O
Where is the highest point?	O
So that's what I'm going to take a look at here so I can see that.	O
I have this part A lot lower.	O
Then on the side.	O
So I think I can.	O
Kick him from that up a little bit.	O
And since she's looking this way.	O
Her.	O
Eyes like will be at the highest point, like in the direction she's looking.	O
Just because like them, the colored part of your eye is like.	O
Live like a Dome on top of the rest of it.	O
So that effects your eyelid.	O
Like the shape of it.	O
Proving toggle on and off the preview I think.	O
Maybe looking a little.	O
Better.	CHITCHAT
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
For me that looks better.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it's it's heading in the right direction.	O
Sorry my desk with my knee.	O
She feeling like I'm gonna sneeze.	O
Have to mute my mic.	O
You're my Minnie Mouse Keys.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
The sun is bigger than the other one.	O
Going to adjust that.	O
So it's got like more of an Oval shape.	O
Here, and I want to kind of.	O
Mirror that shape over here as well.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I did it too much.	CHITCHAT
Man in a movie No.	CHITCHAT

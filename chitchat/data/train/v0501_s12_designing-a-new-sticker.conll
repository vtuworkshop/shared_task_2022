But like when I was looking at her face.	O
Like her, the shape of her chin was different than just the basic thing that I normally draw, so I like pay attention to that and like where her I find up with her nose and everything.	O
So um, it's just a matter of like pay attention to like little subtleties and trying to.	O
Uhm, I guess translate those into your style.	O
So that's that's kind of.	CHITCHAT
What I found.	CHITCHAT
That helped me.	CHITCHAT
And it's like this girl that I'm drawing right now.	O
It's like this is just.	O
From my head, just like seeing what what looks good.	O
Kind of I don't know like I don't know what she looks like.	O
I can't see her in my head but I'm just kind of.	O
Grove Lynn things down.	O
It's like that like it's not like it like.	O
That kind of thing we.	O
Figure this whole thing out on streams that gets kind of see my messy process behind.	O
That All right?	CHITCHAT
So her ears are little off.	O
I think that is shaped that I want.	O
And then I'm going to make sure while the ears.	O
They line up with.	O
Your nose.	O
Is it and then the top like?	O
Your eyebrow hair I.	O
Not like that, but paying attention to little things.	O
Like that will.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Help your characters.	O
I guess not.	CHITCHAT
Look more realistic, but like.	O
It shows you have like an understanding.	O
Of.	O
Basic anatomy, so there's like a lot of.	O
Little things like that, like in the face and like.	O
And the body I like different little.	O
Um, points that line up like that.	O
Like Uhm, I mean you can see it like on your own face your like your corner of your nose.	O
Lines up with the tear ducks in your eyes and.	O
If you're drawing a face like straight on.	O
I was always taught at the corners of the mouth.	O
Like the middle of the eye.	O
Not sure.	CHITCHAT
Corner, I mean your tear ducks lined up your nose.	O
Uhm, and then the ears thing like this.	O
There's a bunch of like weird stuff like that.	O
Pretty interesting.	O
Oh go back.	O
I need to make a video about that.	O
And like so behind on all the videos I want to make, there's too many.	O
So I was doing like I.	O
Like basic anatomy tutorial series and.	O
I did see we did.	O
Nose eyes.	O
Mouth here so we did 4.	O
Different ones of those and I need to do 1 like.	O
The full face, like putting them face together.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Since we did like eyes, nose, mouth.	O

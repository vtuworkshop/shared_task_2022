The things that are like so successful and then we take a look at.	O
Things that could be improved so it's kind of a critique method that I talked about in.	O
One of my most recent videos on YouTube.	O
Talking about how to improve your art so.	O
Like knowing how to look at your art critic, Lee is very important for improvement because otherwise it's like you don't know what you need to improve.	O
Sometimes you can look at it and be like I don't like it.	CHITCHAT
It's like you need to know why.	CHITCHAT
And what specifically?	CHITCHAT
Is the issue that you are seeing?	CHITCHAT
So it's good to.	CHITCHAT
You know, keep a.	CHITCHAT
Positive.	CHITCHAT
Mindset when it comes to looking at your art like even if it's like old art.	CHITCHAT
Um, 'cause the?	CHITCHAT
The art that were We look at in the video is from.	CHITCHAT
2008 all the way until like now.	CHITCHAT
That's just all my Animal Crossing art.	CHITCHAT
That's a lot of stuff because I did a lot of Animal Crossing Fan Art.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But Yeah, like just looking back at that.	CHITCHAT
You know I can.	CHITCHAT
I remember like doing most of those drawings and thinking like all this, I really like this.	CHITCHAT
I did a good job on this.	CHITCHAT
And then looking back at it now, it's like, you know, I can apply myself for trying different things and then.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like realizing what I learned from those things, but I can still be like this is what I would have done differently now.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I think that's important.	CHITCHAT
To learn how to do and.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping that people who watched the video will.	CHITCHAT
See how I'm kind of doing that critique process and they can apply it to their own work.	CHITCHAT
Sam Um?	CHITCHAT
You know I can.	CHITCHAT
I could have just looked at the art and then like haha look at this.	CHITCHAT
It's old and it looks bad, but I don't think that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Productive again.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I can do that like.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And think somethings look funny but.	CHITCHAT
I don't think let's say.	CHITCHAT
A message that they want to.	CHITCHAT
Really dumb.	CHITCHAT
Put out there I guess.	CHITCHAT
Now.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's more of a positive video.	CHITCHAT
It's a little silly sometimes, but.	CHITCHAT
Coming out tomorrow at 3:00 PM.	CHITCHAT
Eastern Time.	CHITCHAT
Did something for eyebrows made.	CHITCHAT
It made them too sassy.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, no no.	CHITCHAT
OK, that was the beginning of the last save.	CHITCHAT
I think I thought I just deleted everything that's about to start crying.	CHITCHAT
Oh Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Play a video comes out tomorrow on YouTube at 3:00 PM Eastern Time and I'm going to do like a little Premier thing like I did for one of the last videos I posted which ended up working out really good.	CHITCHAT
Because.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even know it was a thing, but you can like.	CHITCHAT
Set it to live premiere.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It brings up like a chat window where people can like.	CHITCHAT
Chat during the video premiere.	CHITCHAT
And I can talk to people never there watching the video so.	CHITCHAT
That was pretty cool last time.	CHITCHAT
I think I think we're going to try that again.	CHITCHAT
I mistook her eyebrows somewhere along the way, and I don't know what happened.	O
Like the shape is different.	O
I like this one more I think.	O

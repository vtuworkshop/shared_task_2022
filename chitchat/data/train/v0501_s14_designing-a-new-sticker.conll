Whoops I'm also working on another video for this month that should be out and see what day is it.	O
Ah, probably next.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it'll be out next week.	CHITCHAT
Maybe on the 29th or the 30th, but I'm going to be talking about.	CHITCHAT
My.	CHITCHAT
Art journey and.	CHITCHAT
I think it's mostly going to be focused on like art school and.	CHITCHAT
Like freelance.	CHITCHAT
Stuff and like how I started doing freelance 'cause I know a lot of people on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I asked them like what do you want to know as far as like?	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
About my Career or like school or anything, and that's mostly what they said they wanted to knows about those two things.	CHITCHAT
So it is going to be a little bit about.	CHITCHAT
You know the rest of it.	CHITCHAT
When I started drawing, but I think hearing other peoples stories.	CHITCHAT
It's really helpful.	CHITCHAT
When you're trying to decide like what you want to do.	CHITCHAT
'cause that's what I would do like.	CHITCHAT
Before I started doing freelance, I didn't know I that's what I was going to do and I.	CHITCHAT
I was listening to a lot of podcasts at work.	CHITCHAT
And that's kind of like what made me.	CHITCHAT
Decide to start doing this.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I knew I wanted to do something with art, but.	CHITCHAT
Who made me understand that like doing freelance is?	CHITCHAT
A possibility.	CHITCHAT
So hopefully I get that video done soon and you guys can.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Watched it on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
See everyone feeling at my art education so liking.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I'd Dunning Kruger effect is.	CHITCHAT
Oh OK, uhm.	CHITCHAT
How much art education do you have?	CHITCHAT
Have you been to school or are you in college or you out of college or you in high school still?	CHITCHAT
That'll help me.	CHITCHAT
Answer your question, hold it better or at least talked about it a little more.	CHITCHAT
As far as like my experience with.	CHITCHAT
Education like heart wise.	CHITCHAT
I felt like a lot of time was wasted on doing like.	CHITCHAT
What are they called?	CHITCHAT
Like your prereqs like.	CHITCHAT
Right now.	CHITCHAT
Like I mean I, I did like fundamental classes, um, like 2D, and like I already knew how to do most of the stuff.	CHITCHAT
And that was like a class that I could have tested out of.	CHITCHAT
But for some reason I.	CHITCHAT
It didn't.	CHITCHAT
They didn't let me, and then my teacher was like why are you in this class like well?	CHITCHAT
I don't want to hear that.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's like why?	CHITCHAT
Why do I have to take classes then?	CHITCHAT
Don't make sense.	CHITCHAT
It's just like a waste of time and money.	CHITCHAT
And I, I mean, I understand that there are things where it's like maybe you didn't know you liked this thing like took photography classes like I already knew I liked photography, but Hum.	CHITCHAT
So like trying different things can help you with other stuff but.	CHITCHAT

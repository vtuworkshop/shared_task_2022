And it was mainly because.	CHITCHAT
The teacher made the class like too hard.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And he had a like.	CHITCHAT
Remember, he had to um curve it like where like I had a D in the class and then by the end of it I had to be.	CHITCHAT
Because he curved it so much because so many people did really bad.	CHITCHAT
And I think it was mostly because he made the tests too hard.	CHITCHAT
Through House party was.	CHITCHAT
Whatever.	CHITCHAT

Another month if you don't want to be.	CHITCHAT
Buttom Even like Switcher classes.	CHITCHAT
Anytime during that, so it's nice.	CHITCHAT

Then You can just kind of switch.	CHITCHAT
Whenever.	CHITCHAT

And I didn't actually finish the Class.	CHITCHAT
I was almost done and then I.	CHITCHAT
Not too busy and I couldn't work on it anymore so I.	CHITCHAT
I stopped after that month and then.	CHITCHAT
Wanting to go back and finish it, 'cause I only had like two more lessons left in it, but there are so many other classes that I wanted to take 2.	CHITCHAT
But I guess was like an online.	CHITCHAT
Kind of learning thing.	CHITCHAT
Everybody kind of has their own.	CHITCHAT

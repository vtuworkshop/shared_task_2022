But for me it's like.	CHITCHAT
If I'm looking up the information like I want to know it, I want to like learn it, so I'm going to dedicate the time.	CHITCHAT
To it, I guess.	CHITCHAT
So it's like with I guess with online learning.	CHITCHAT
It's like a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Dedication is like how much do you want to?	CHITCHAT
Do whatever you're trying to learn.	CHITCHAT
How much time do you want to spend on it?	CHITCHAT
Well, that's good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'd like even just watching people do live streams I think is good.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
'cause of course like you can ask questions and stuff and.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Kind of like.	CHITCHAT
See the process.	CHITCHAT
I think that's another big thing is like seeing process in real time.	CHITCHAT
Is really helpful.	CHITCHAT
Looks like you can look at.	CHITCHAT
The drawing, when it's finished me like wow, I don't know how you got there.	CHITCHAT
Then you see the whole process and it's like oh.	CHITCHAT
Different than I thought it was or whatever like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know like most of the time you see.	CHITCHAT
Like You seem like a really good illustration, like Oh wow, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
And like I bet they that was like easy to do or it's like they are really good at what they do so it's easy.	CHITCHAT
And then like maybe if you see a.	CHITCHAT
A real time version of it.	CHITCHAT
You see, like you know, sometimes it's not as easy as you think it is and it's.	CHITCHAT
Like a lot of trial and error.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't wanna go I'm doing right now.	CHITCHAT
I think I might just keep her hair.	O
This part of her hair come from the other sketch.	O
So we're gonna hide that, and I think we have.	O
Actually duplicate this one.	O
Bring back a little bit.	O
After I erase some things.	O
Setting and proud to.	O
Start doing some.	O
Color.	O
Words with friends.	O
Blade off of color here.	O
Please.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm going to do is.	O
Merge my original sketch.	O
And these lines are here.	O
So I'm just kind of a racing out some of the stuff that I don't want in there.	O
Like her hair is going to be behind her earrings.	O
I don't need all this.	O
But sometimes I like to leave a little bit of it in there because.	O
Feel like it has more life to it, I'll leave.	O
Some of the sketch lines in there.	O
Sound.	O
But if they're not really like helping in some areas like it's OK to just going in a race.	O
Like I feel like this line right here, like taking that away kind of changes the shape of her.	O
I think it's important to have that there.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Here after we lay down some color.	O

I'm going to.	O
Paint on top of everything.	O
So it's not really a big deal if I have a bunch of these, like sketch lines.	O
But since her hair is on.	O
This.	O
Farm layer right here.	O
And I want it to be darker to match the rest of it.	O
I'm going to go in.	O
And.	O
Separate this part of layer.	O
I'm using the lasso tool and I'm actually going to add.	O
From little pieces.	O
To the selection.	O
By pressing shift are likely on shift.	O
And then we are going to.	O
Cut this.	O
So it's on its own.	O
And then I'm going to.	O
Change the opacity.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that looks better 'cause I'm going to add a lot of texture behind it.	O
I think I'm actually going to.	O
Some of this over 2.	O
Might need to move it a lot more.	O
Oh my contact problem.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So I'm gonna check this show backdrop.	O
Right now.	O
And Lastly this around.	O
So I can see like her face.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
So matter.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
And then I wanna go back and I'm going to race a little bit.	O
Up This.	CHITCHAT
Concept.	CHITCHAT
Not all of it, but that little circle down there was bothering me.	O
It was more to come.	O
Try to understand how the neck was connecting.	O
Well it better.	O
So I'm going to duplicate are.	O
Lines right here.	O
Just because I.	O
I guess I duplicate things a lot because I don't want to.	O
Liz, down Like after I've merged these together, I want them to still be.	O
Their own thing, just in case whatever I do.	O
Like right here.	O
Say something like I don't.	O
I don't like, I guess, um.	O
So I'm just trying to.	O
Make sure I am not like regretting.	O
Merging these together here in a little bit.	O
'cause I've done that plenty of times.	O
Where no I.	CHITCHAT
Work on something for a while and then I'm like, OK, we're going to merge together and then I'm like, oh, I don't like this, but then I can't see what I did before.	O
So it's always good to.	O
Duplicate your hair layers.	O
And we can just hide him in the background.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna go ahead and fruit.	O

So what we're going to do now is.	O
Ask is this sound?	CHITCHAT
Just need to finish.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
And now I'm going to make a layer underneath the lines.	O
We're going to block in the silhouette, so I'm going to take.	O
Lasso tool and we're just gonna come in here.	O
Go underneath of our lines.	O
And walk out our silhouette.	O
Do you need anything?	O
I guess her hair is a little bit different.	O
I think I'll use a brush.	O
To fill in her hair, but.	O
She's gonna come in and do.	O
The basic shape.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
'cause I wanna add some like texture on the outside.	O
Over here and I don't want it to be like you know.	O
Super angular.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Convert here.	O
This side too.	O
So we've got.	CHITCHAT
Basically, this is the shape of her silhouette, and we're going to go ahead and fill that layer.	O
I mean really, the color doesn't matter because we're gonna end up changing it.	O
Um, just readjusting it, but so this is.	O
Basically her silhouette and then I'm going to.	O
Come in here with another brush.	O
Trying to figure out which one I want.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't want her hair to be.	O
You know, like angular or like super precise, I wanted to have.	O
Some life to it, so we're just going to come in here and.	O
Do some of this at 1st and then we can always go back.	O
And change some of it.	O
Hearing them a little bit.	O
Even need to make this law.	O
Sticker.	O
So right now we're just thinking of the overall shape.	O
Like as far as her hair right here.	O
I like these little curly pieces.	O
Sticking out from the silhouette.	O
Using the lines, so I think we'll keep that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I'm seeing that.	O
Tomorrow at this shape here and then more this shape over here and it's fine.	O
Then it's you know, asymmetrical, but it's not.	O
Really, the look I want to go for, so it's her hair.	O
The part is down is coming out right here.	O
And then over here it's like way down here.	O
So I think we're going to.	O
I like this slide.	CHITCHAT
Better grassroots this up a little bit more.	O
It's looking better.	O
I have to go back and add some.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Mind.	CHITCHAT
On top of these, but it's OK.	O
To have it like this right now.	O
So just looking at the silhouette.	O
Bye, I hope you enjoyed watching me draw for a little bit.	O
You know it's a.	O
It's been a long stream so far.	O
I understand that they can't stay for the whole time, but you can always go back and watch it so.	O
Uhm, yes, that's good.	O
She missed any part that you wanted to see.	O
Will probably stream and till.	O
That 15 Probably probably go another.	O

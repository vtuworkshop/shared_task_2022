Hour and 20 minutes.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Will be almost.	CHITCHAT
Fine right now.	CHITCHAT
Now in 20 minutes so before or something.	CHITCHAT
So we almost 5.	CHITCHAT
And if I don't finish this today, I will pick back up.	CHITCHAT
On it during another stream so I won't work on it.	CHITCHAT
Ann Like off stream will just pick it back up next week.	CHITCHAT
So I have this one and I have a.	O
Print design that I'm going to work on with the same character.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is basically a silhouette.	O
And I'm going to adjust the colors I lay down.	O
Something it to keep moving the icons to the wrong screening.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
So now what we are going to do?	CHITCHAT
Like moving my pin in weird places.	O
Click the little cursor like ends up on the other screen or it's like on the other side of the tablet not moving around.	O
The pin in there also.	O
That's fine now, OK.	CHITCHAT
American missed you know OK?	CHITCHAT
So we're going to make another layer on top of this one here, and we're going to make it a clipping mask.	O
So that means that we can.	CHITCHAT
Do that.	CHITCHAT
Can we stay in the lines and fantastic because we don't have to worry about getting outside the lines anymore.	O
So in this stage I am going to lay down.	O
All my base colors and um.	O
Add some like color variation and like skin tone and like in our hair.	O
All I had like a few different.	O
Towns, but I'm not necessarily focused on.	O
Like shadow	O
And highlights right now.	O
Because I'll go back here in a little bit and I will.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Probably use multiply and do that.	O
Right now I'm just trying to figure out my colors and it's very.	O
Very subtle crosses.	O
Because, you know, I will come back here and I will pick colors from the canvas to create more gradients.	O
A brush name sees us so.	O
There's this brush.	O
Is a chalk brush and I think I modified it.	O
I know we've had this conversation during the stream before and I don't know, um.	O
Menu.	CHITCHAT
I think I I might have modified this one, but.	O
It was originally a brush from.	O
Like one of the default brushes in Photoshop, it's just called.	O
Chalk 36 pixels.	O
But I think I did change something about it.	O
I don't remember what it's been a long time.	O
But that's the brush I'm kind of using right now to add a little bit of like blending.	O
But the rest of the rush is that I've been using.	O
I have them linked in the video description there lodging sketch brushes.	O

For photo shop.	O
So those are the ones I normally use.	O
This is why I used to use actually like before I got those brushes.	O
But I'm just kind of.	O
Adding some blending and stuff in here real quick and then I'm going to go back and I'll use more of a textured brush so will use.	O
Probably this sharp render that sharp render brush right here.	O
And that's in that Gene Sketch Pack, so we'll use.	O
That will probably use the edge control brushes, 'cause I really like to use those for my shading, but this is just to basically lay down.	O
Some.	O
Colors in here like quickly.	O
I feel like this Fresh Varisoft, but it's got some covenant, some kind of an edge to it, so it's not like a completely smooth brush.	O
From But at least I I usually do this part kind of quickly, just like laying down a colors.	O
And then we'll go back and refine it a little bit better.	O
This is just to try to like help me see.	O
Like where I want things to be laid down.	O
I need to upload this brush to.	O
Patris on though.	O
I have A free brush on there.	O
From when I first started.	O
Using Patrion.	O
I think it is a very very very bottom of the entire patrion feed.	O
And to make A tag that just says like.	O
Free brush or something?	O
So it's easy to find.	O
But I'll try to upload some of mine.	O
Rush is on there.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Uh, OK, so now I'm going to basically do the same thing or.	O
Like the hair and the shirt and the earrings, and then I'll do another layer for her eyes and her lip color as well.	O
So we just make another layer and then make it a clipping mask.	O
So on Mac if you hold option and then click in between.	O
These two layers, then it'll clip the top one is that one.	O
From let's see wanna do.	CHITCHAT
My sis.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
And I know the lines right here.	O
They look a little weird because there a lot lighter than this color I'm laying down right now.	O
So what will end up doing is will make clipping masks on these lines, just like we're doing for the.	O
Like we're making clipping masks on top of the silhouette.	O
And that will allow us to change the color of the lines.	O
So everything will look a lot more cohesive, but I feel like if you lay down the.	O
Colors.	O
On top of the Sylow at 1st and then go back and do the lines.	O
They look alot better as far as.	O
Making them look more.	O
Harmonious I also feel like it did not.	O
Yeah, I didn't fill in the silhouette all the way so you can see right here.	O
I missed wow, what do I do?	CHITCHAT

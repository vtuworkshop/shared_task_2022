Uhm, I missed that part.	CHITCHAT
Because there is a line covering that up, so I hide the lines and I go back in here which I should have done this before, but.	O
I just go in here and fill those parts in so we don't have to worry about.	O
It not filling in.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
More coloring on top of it.	O
Bring all this pack.	O
Keep going.	CHITCHAT
Also.	CHITCHAT
If.	CHITCHAT
So it's like I'm coloring her hair like all the way out here and it's not showing up if I go back here and let it doesn't matter what color I pick up.	O
If I color outside will just switch the color real quick.	O
So like I'm coloring with white right now.	O
But since I'm filling in the silhouette layer.	O
Like I'm extending it, all the stuff is clicked on top of it.	O
This is trying to go on top of that now.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you can use that to your advantage, like if I change the shape for her.	O
Then it would still be that color.	O
I like actually filled in completely, but I don't really do that before 'cause the brush.	O
Is not completely coloring everything in solid.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Unless I go over a typical time, which is?	O
I mean that's like what I want.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to have like more of A.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Gradient kind of look.	O
Instead of like being like this, you know.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
You know when you're working in this stage, you can even set this to multiply.	O
If it helps, you kind of see.	O
Colors better.	O
Which sometimes I do that but.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it makes things.	CHITCHAT
Like if I were to.	CHITCHAT
Say.	CHITCHAT
It's not the color I'm gonna use for her eyes, but like if I do this.	O
Then it changes that color.	O
Of the wines.	O
Because it's like a It's being applied like the line layer is being applied to everything underneath of it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I think I'll be OK doing this and maybe I'll.	O
But just like a little bit more.	O
I'll just go back and do it here in a little bit.	O
Wrong color.	O
I don't know if I like this little piece here.	O
Maybe it's in the shape I made it up.	O
Get.	CHITCHAT
Well, as well as everything.	CHITCHAT
Alright, go back and change it here in a little bit.	O
But See OK.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to do the same thing.	O
Make another layer, I get a clipping mask.	O
Because I am, I want to keep everything kind of separated on different layers 'cause like.	O
Say I wanted to change your hair color since her hair is on a different layer, I can just.	O

Do this.	CHITCHAT
I could.	CHITCHAT
Make it blue if I wanted too.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So we can do that with everything that I keep on a separate layer.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
What color did I want her shirt typically?	O
It was like a really light orange.	O
Say like this is a perfect example.	O
I don't know if I like this color, so I'm going to.	O
Do some adjusting.	O
So we can take this.	O
Slide it around.	O
Make it more saturated in desaturated lightning it was dark and it.	O
And then we can always go back and.	O
Compare.	O
So I do like this smart thing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it's a little bit too saturated.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I actually kind of like the blue too.	O
But I think we're going to go with a more natural hair color for this one, because I'll have all these colors behind her hair.	O
Um and.	CHITCHAT
The previous print sticker club drawing that I did her hair was blue like a blue green so I don't want to like do that again.	O
Hum, I like to keep him.	CHITCHAT
Like kind of such a map.	O
With each one.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I am going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to do it right now, I'm gonna add like a pattern on to this hurt like little oranges.	O
But Right now.	O
Since I need to like completely color everything in first, I'm just going to leave it.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
No, leave it for now and.	O
I'm going to come in here.	O
Change your lip color.	O
Which right now you won't be able to see it early.	O
Because it's.	O
The lines here.	O
But I can go in here.	O
Just in a little bit.	O
Thank you 'cause I don't really want them to be a mauve color.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And also I think I'll do though.	O
Eyes on this layer.	O
Usually you know.	O
Wait, this is an off white forward to do.	O
A white that was like this, right?	O
It looks cut off.	O
'cause like your eyes aren't actually like white.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Because like shadows and everything.	O
But I I found that sometimes whenever you're making a sticker, if the background of the sticker is white and then you have the eye color like Morgan natural eye color.	O
Like the whites of their eyes.	O
Then it it looks weird with the sticker like print out so.	O
I always start out doing like a.	O
Off White curve.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
And then I'll add some like bright white.	O
Here, in a little bit.	O
Probably once I get every.	O
Like colour lay down.	O
And I think that.	O
That kind of happens because.	O
You know you can see an example.	O

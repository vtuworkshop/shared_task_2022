So I guess this is one of the stickers, like my test sticker.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how focus it is, so like her eyes were more of a pink tone and compared to the background that makes him look.	O
Um, like they're not supposed to be that color.	O
Or at least it is to me.	O
So whenever I like that was my test print every printed and.	O
I made them a little bit brighter.	O
Find another example.	O
To have like all my stickers in a drawer.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
So I guess it's different look like this one.	O
She's got sunglasses on.	O
I don't know that something will change here in a little bit.	O
Yeah, I think it's really nice how.	O
I think it's just in a replay of the live stream.	O
On Behance it will tell you like the tool timelines.	O
I'm like recording my tool capture right now.	O
So it will tell you exactly what I'm using.	O
Like you can go like.	O
To that exact.	O
Part of the video and it will tell you this is what I'm doing, like brushes like down to the color like it'll tell you like the number down here, like what color amusing.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I think that's a really cool feature.	CHITCHAT
Remove these hearings.	O
I must come in fact 2 bright.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Cow tipping.	CHITCHAT
Could add the background now or we could color the lines.	O
Single color the lines first.	O
I'll do that to see them clipping mask like we did before.	O
So I'd like to start out the eyes.	O
I usually don't.	O
Pick no startup black.	O
'cause I feel like if you do more of A.	O
Can dark Brown around the eyes like goes with your color palettes better?	O
So I feel like every time you use like straight up like black like 00000.	O
Things out.	O
More.	O
Honest, cohesive.	O
But we do want to watch out because.	O
She can see and here I have some little sketch lines and I don't want.	O
That was to be this dark Brown color.	O
I'm just cut my wrist that out.	O
And only focus on.	O
Her lash lines.	O
And then we'll make a clipping mask underneath of this.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So since I have this kind of like blocked out for her eyes.	O

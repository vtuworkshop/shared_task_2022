I'm going to make a clipping mask underneath that, like in between the lines and those lines because see I have.	O
Like Her hair, kind of like going underneath of that line.	O
And I want to keep them separate.	O
Just because, um?	CHITCHAT
I don't want to like there on top of this again.	O
Which actually.	CHITCHAT
The colour I'm choosing for her hair.	O
Pretty similar to.	O
Well, just for her eyes.	O
Anyways.	CHITCHAT
We're just gonna go with it right now.	O
So I do need to add some like highlights in her hair.	O
Miley got too dark but it's OK because since it's an hour later we can play around with the color.	O
Like for the lines, I'll pick a different color, like a darker colors and.	O
The face.	O
Color.	O
And then, um.	CHITCHAT
But like I don't want to be too dark because then it.	O
Starts to look.	O
Like it's not.	O
Cohesive within.	O
So we just kind of need to fill this in first and then we can change that.	O
So like match it better.	O
And sometimes you know with this ear right here, so I had.	O
But these lines coming all the way out here.	O
And I can like.	CHITCHAT
Clean it up a little bit like just coming coming in here like this.	O
Like the same thing with this orange.	O
Hearing I love coming here and clean that up because we're going to paint on top of everything anyways.	O
Or just trying to figure things out right now.	O
We're setting ourselves up for success later.	O
Well, I just kind of go on top and paint.	O
So this is helping me see.	O
Shapes better.	O
Like with her neck like this line.	O
Bring it in a little bit.	O
This I'm not erasing it, I'm just.	O
Taking the color from.	O
The lines on her hair.	O
I was pulling it in like that, so I'm just kind of refining.	O
What's already there?	O
Well thank you, Susanna.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Make sure we get these little curlies and here.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
See how.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's zoom out a little bit and.	O
I'm gonna take a look at this color color balance.	O
I think it's already looking better.	CHITCHAT
Shifting it more towards.	O
Red More saturated No, no wrong direction.	O
OK, something else.	CHITCHAT
Better solid white difference is very subtle.	O
One last thing, we are going to do.	CHITCHAT

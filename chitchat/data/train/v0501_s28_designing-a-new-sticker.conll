Stupid.	CHITCHAT
Too much.	CHITCHAT
I do need to add some more color variation in her hair still.	O
But before we do that, I am going to.	O
I'm going to go into the background and we're going to take a look at these little details back here and see.	O
Where we want everything to be placed.	O
Yes, the square square canvas is perfect for Instagram.	O
Not great, her Prince all the time but.	O
Um, I'm actually making this one into a sticker.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I usually try to keep my stickers kind of like in the three-by-three kind of range.	O
Like sometimes I shrink it and see long gated otherwise, but it's like maximum.	O
3.4 inches on the longer side I think just because of the way that I print with my cricket.	O
Alright, cut with my cricket cricket.	O
Why am I doing?	CHITCHAT
Who's gonna change this?	CHITCHAT
We're going to adjust her eye color a little bit.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to take a look at this background.	O
So here it is right here.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
You know, after coloring.	O
Her and adding some like basic tones down.	O
Seeing this in the background, I think I'm going to have some of it kind of overlap.	O
I think that would be cool like it's coming.	O
Fast forward almost.	O
But it will have to kind of lay this stuff down 1st and then.	O
Go on top of everything and kind of like layer it in.	O
But I'm going to actually color on top of.	O
These are.	CHITCHAT
These lines are laid back here because.	O
Don't necessarily want everything in the background to have lines.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Um, when you get your stickers printed, don't they expect a vector format?	O
I print my stickers at home and I just save them as a PNG so I don't need to use like.	O
Illustrator or anything.	O
I just used Photoshop to do that.	O
Especially since I'm really bad at using illustrator, only used it like one time for a class and.	O
I'm like so.	CHITCHAT
Used to photo shop then I.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I have a hard time with illustrator and I have enough experience with it.	O
Just know the ways of photo shop.	O
But I will show you guys, um, probably probably won't get to it today, but next time what will do is will so I'll hide the background.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Basically.	CHITCHAT
So it's not like it's going to be completely accurate, but will do something like.	O
The kind of like cut out the shape.	O
Probably not the best example.	O
This is a brush I normally use.	O
Thank you kind of this.	CHITCHAT
Kind of deal.	CHITCHAT
Whatever I do in the background will cut that out and then.	O
So basically I'm making a kite outline.	O
And then will just fill it in.	O
So it'll be printed in that.	O
Will be printed.	O
On It will be printed through my cricket design space app thing uhm?	O

I make a layer on top of everything and I'll fill it in with white and then I'll change the blending mode to color and that'll help me see if things are.	O
To um, like even in town.	CHITCHAT
So right now I'm kind of seeing that.	O
The Orange and the green that I picked a very similar.	O
And I think they need to be lighter than her hair.	O
Um, like even her skin tone is.	O
Kind of similar to this value.	O
So I think it means pop more as well, like I think maybe the oranges do too.	O
Like there's not enough contrast, but I mean I guess I haven't added any.	O
Shading.	O
Yet.	CHITCHAT
So I think what I'll do is.	O
Lighten up these oranges.	O
I think there.	CHITCHAT
Not the right color.	O
Sing Needed new, needed to be more yellow anyways.	O
Not too yellow Brown.	O
So yeah, they definitely pop a lot more.	O
And then once I add some like highlights, like a highlighter, lipson like forehead, chin, nose and then like in gear.	O
Uhm, I think that'll add some nice contrast.	O
Some highlights in her hair.	O
Window.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
We're gonna mess with this too.	O
We want to have a nice variety in art.	O
Values.	O
Because.	CHITCHAT
Um, we want.	CHITCHAT
To have some good contrast.	O
So we're doing this layer.	O
You can see the value instead of just trying to look at the color for what it is.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I just realized the flip.	CHITCHAT
The camera is not in.	CHITCHAT
Flip it back.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna delete this and.	O
We're gonna play around with.	O
We're going to play around with adding.	O
Some of these elements like on top.	O
Of.	CHITCHAT
Like her hair right here.	O
Have some things like.	O
Come forward.	O
He must wait for in that way so.	O
It wouldn't make sense to have one right here, and if it was coming from.	O
Inside of her hair.	O
I guess really the only ones that make sense, or the ones that are down here.	O
More like a smaller.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I like the Flowers like scattered throughout her hair like this.	O
I feel like it looks too like Poklek Gotti.	O

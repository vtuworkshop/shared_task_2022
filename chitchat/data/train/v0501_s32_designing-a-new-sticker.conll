So maybe if I did.	O
Oh no, I don't know up in the preview.	O
I think it looks better.	O
With the Flowers maybe?	O
It's hard to say.	CHITCHAT
Think of the side here in a little bit.	O
I like the ones up here.	O
I think these looks Super Cute.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Don't think.	CHITCHAT
What I added for the background.	O
Look bad I'm not 100% happy with it far as placement goes.	O
But I think it's going in the right direction.	O
I think it's something that I'll just keep adding to.	O
As I kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll see you like, Oh, I think this this could work and then try something and then change your mind like.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
I don't want her to look like she has like years up here, like little bear ears, so I'm trying to make trying to make it like asymmetrical.	O
It was OK.	CHITCHAT
Mom.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to lose it background alone for now and I'll think about it.	O
So what we're gonna do now is I'm going to add a little bit of color variation.	O
Like Toms in her hair.	O
So when I.	O
Take.	O
He textured brush.	O
I think we're going to use the sharp render brush and the gene sketch.	O
Brush Pack Gonna come in here and add.	O
Some textured shadows, so you can kind of see.	O
In here it's a little bit of.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Agreed to it.	CHITCHAT
I really like this brush, but.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Alright later.	CHITCHAT
They don't think I change the color of the lines in here.	O
So it's like hard to see when I just laid down and I have to go back and.	O
Headed down some more.	O
But I just want to add some.	O
Shading.	O
2.	O
The kind of like the underneath part right here and then where it comes in.	O
And I will come back out and have like a highlight on it.	O
We're just going to do some subtle shading, some at the bottom to try to give it more of an overall form.	O
Also think.	CHITCHAT
Little bit.	O
Not messy there, so OK, never mind it's hanging on top of this.	O
I have to go back in.	O
That's more precise.	O
Clean up in here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Oh, by the way, if you want to just color on one of your clipping mask layers and not touch anything like.	O

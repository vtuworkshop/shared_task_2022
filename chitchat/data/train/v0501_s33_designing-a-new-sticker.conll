Underneath it like this.	O
You can click the layer lock like this transparency lock, so now I can't color outside of that.	O
Only coloring on her hair.	O
Just very gently.	O
Pressing here to add a little bit of texture.	O
And variation in here and we want to put some.	O
Where her little ponytail kind of like.	O
Comes in and then it'll have the highlight on the top.	O
We found a little bit and he rendering of Flowers.	O
And then what will do is will take.	O
This base color.	O
And we're going to add a highlight.	O
Colour not like a super precise.	O
Highlight, but we're gonna just kind of.	O
Add a pop of color.	O
I'm here.	CHITCHAT
Because I'll go back and I'll add like more curly.	O
Like individual curls I guess.	O
But we just want to get the.	O
That's not the color I wanted.	O
We just want to get the overall like feel for the shape of her hair.	O
And because like when you're drawing here, it's best to think of the overall shape before you get into like little details.	O
'cause otherwise you'll get overwhelmed.	O
Really, I do.	CHITCHAT
I don't think about it like this way, so I just kind of like blocking.	O
Where the?	CHITCHAT
Highlights would go.	O
No, I deleted her hair.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
He So I'm going to add another layer on top of this variation.	O
The tone variation in their skin, and I'm going to.	O
Take this fresh, yes?	O
I say edge control smooth.	O
And we're just going to come in here and add.	O
Some more contrast.	O
By slightly changing.	O
These tones.	O
And being a little bit more precise where?	O
Will put in.	O
They claim the color down.	O
Because I do need to add some.	O
Highlights Contrast in here.	O
Just trying to get.	O
The color that I want.	O
And the thing I like about this brush.	O
Is.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I do this one side is like.	O
Nicely textured and it kind of like fades out into a soft edge.	O
And then one side is.	O
A hard edge, so it's really nice whenever you're just coming in and adding.	O
Some of these?	CHITCHAT
Subtle tones I'm also going to decrease the Opacity in the flow on this brush right now, just 'cause I want to really come in here.	O
And lightly.	O
Fresh this in.	O
But on my express' remote thingy, I have one of my breath, my button set to option.	O

That's New York time and 10:00 AM PST.	CHITCHAT
That's every time.	CHITCHAT
Today I'm going to be making stickers.	O
Last week I made collaborative patterns and ask all be watching to give me problems.	O
And ideas to create patterns that all of us made collectively and it turned out.	O
OK, I was actually pretty fun.	CHITCHAT
So every everybody reactions and ideas and just people bouncing off ideas with each other and I thought I was like super great and really.	CHITCHAT
Sign in.	CHITCHAT
Keep the same.	CHITCHAT
Do something in the same vein.	CHITCHAT
Today, I'd like you to give me objects to anything you like and try and make it as weird as you possibly can, and I'll do my best to place like a simple vector of it.	O
Nothing too complicated, I hope.	CHITCHAT
I have no clue how many in Vietnamese.	CHITCHAT
How many stickers I'm gonna make or expect to me, but I'll try and pick the weirdest ones and we are just suggestions that seem the most interesting or fun to keep you make.	O
So just keep shooting Bronx and ideas.	O
And in the second half of the stream in like half an hour or so, depending on how far we get or how far.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I can compile all the stickers and then add some type in.	O
Make a poster based on your suggestions if there's time.	O
'cause I see that will be cooler if we just had.	O
You guys dancing up ideas with me and each other and collaborating and then.	CHITCHAT
Meetings and they have like a in product at the end of it you can make up objects, make up words.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't happen in sense.	CHITCHAT
Like literally just the first, you can like smash your keyboard and then I'll try and make sense out of it and then try and create something that looks or feels like the gibberish we presented me with and I'll try and make something that feels like the word 2.	CHITCHAT
So the chat LAX by a few minutes since being ancestors in the early stages of development of their live streaming feature.	CHITCHAT
So take a few minutes for me to actually see an active on your ideas and responses.	CHITCHAT
So just keep that in mind.	CHITCHAT
That keep commenting keeps asking questions if you have any.	CHITCHAT
He's talking to other people on in the chat is really great when you guys collaborate and talk to each other and didn't know one another.	CHITCHAT
And if someone else doesn't idea, that's really like just let me know and I'll read the chances of me doing it.	CHITCHAT
Depending on how many responses I get, so it's my duty to keep going.	CHITCHAT
Sure, actually Grambling and time filling the Laos just like last week's episode.	CHITCHAT

Every episode I'm going to motor cause drive your position that.	CHITCHAT
That I really believe it.	CHITCHAT
And this week I'd like to talk about what's happening in Yemen.	CHITCHAT
Yemen is suffering from the worst humanitarian crisis in the last 100 years there, fighting off of Cholera epidemic and the current coldest pandemics, famine, and war all at the same time.	CHITCHAT
It isn't getting a lot of media coverage, so it's important we try to educate ourselves about it and I put some links with petitions you can sign and even put links to articles explaining.	CHITCHAT
What's happening over there?	CHITCHAT
If you don't know already, and I've even put links to places you could do need to if you see like, but I just feel like it's important it gets the recognition it deserves, especially with everything going on currently.	CHITCHAT
It's really hard for new stories to get.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
The Times they deserves and the tablets that deserves an icy like Yemen, the situation in Yemen really needs to be true statement spoken about a lot more.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, check out the links in my description.	CHITCHAT
Please check them out and if you want one more information or if you're willing to donate.	CHITCHAT
And Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Hope you guys don't do that.	CHITCHAT

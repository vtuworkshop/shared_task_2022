Recommending and I think this is going to be fine.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really expecting to me.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm not really saying anything I make and then I started to be with the portfolio already, but I just build a part of these teams for the first few episodes that you navigate what I'm doing and how I'm doing it until I get more comfortable to start working on actual projects.	CHITCHAT
That I really, really care about him feel like chatting, but I I'm just having fun with this as we go so it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, again, I'm making stickers.	CHITCHAT
So if you have any problems, objects or any weird suggestions as to what you think I should make?	CHITCHAT
Put them in the comments and I can start making them come.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I like I said last week is kind of feels like Ratatouille, where all if you watching that you control my actions and get to decide when I get to Maine.	CHITCHAT
So I think that should be fine and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's just start doing it.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what people have to say.	CHITCHAT
Nothing, no suggestions.	CHITCHAT
But I, Victoria, Himo, uh, most says sharpening your hair looks so good.	CHITCHAT
No it doesn't it?	CHITCHAT
I highly disagree so today is Father's Day and.	CHITCHAT
My father decided to give me a haircut because it was getting out of hand.	CHITCHAT
Um so.	CHITCHAT
I listen and it's an awful hacker.	CHITCHAT
I don't like it as much, but if you do then ensure.	CHITCHAT
Yamaha, his hair does look good almost as do a car or a bird or a mirror.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it is a good idea for starters.	O
I'm using just an 11 by 17 tabloid size artboard.	O
And just like the basic poster size.	O
And with this event goes from there.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to try and you compare first equal suggestions coming.	CHITCHAT
If you have any ideas.	CHITCHAT
It would be great to hear if you do, and again, the Weirder it is, the better.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't really need to make sense.	CHITCHAT
I feel like that would be most fun.	CHITCHAT
Um, 'cause I do make a lot of abstract.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Not meeting senses.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
He says.	CHITCHAT
Weird suggestions coming.	CHITCHAT
And I would have a problem with that I said about.	CHITCHAT
OK um.	CHITCHAT
See ya.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for your support.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for watching beauty set the camera.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's go out next, but let's try and make something weird as an example.	O
But that's still a camera.	CHITCHAT
Sci-fi tile, thank you for pointing, he says, who the hell track everyone is, everyone's liking my haircut.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you for the for the ego boost.	CHITCHAT
This is why I do these things in the 1st place.	CHITCHAT
It's all about me and you guys.	CHITCHAT
Complementing mean just, this invalidates 9.	CHITCHAT
Feelings and opinions even when I'm not feeling too good without says Hi Hi Raj and it says do a gecko taking ice cream.	CHITCHAT
Yeah OK so that says our Internet.	CHITCHAT
OK let me first make them.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna make.	O
Super easy elective lines.	O
And I'm not really sure I do intend on making a poster at the end of this.	O
I'm not too sure how everything is going to pan out because I'm again, I'm just be balling this.	O
And I don't know what I'm doing, but that's the fun of it because.	CHITCHAT
I'm also doing this time, like make work really quickly and then use the meeting was really quickly.	CHITCHAT
Meeting work that.	CHITCHAT
Speaking, developing ideas are on TV, completely flushed out, but are just more for finding more collaborative.	CHITCHAT
Interacting with you guys.	CHITCHAT
Probably the best part of it because I get to hear from so many different people.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
He says we order shall be amoeba.	CHITCHAT
Yes, OK, I can make it to me by camera maybe.	CHITCHAT
How does that sound?	CHITCHAT
Um, most as well, and I love the capital idea.	CHITCHAT
Then and I love the ghetto ideas.	CHITCHAT
OK, how's that for them?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to hold off on adding colors for the time being because.	O
Let's just see how everything looks.	O
I'm not sure if everything's gonna have a consistent style yet or not.	O
Design looks like a mirror like.	O
It doesn't look like.	O
Let me know how I can make.	O
Like Hum, OK, let's go for the.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
You do something more organic.	O
And do mine by biology.	O
I am not the best, I'm just making like a school afterlife.	O
And then I'm pretty sure it has.	O

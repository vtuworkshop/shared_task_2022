Who he good?	CHITCHAT
Morning everybody, hopefully.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully people can hear me alright had some at some technical troubles this morning to plug in and unplug and then plug it back in again.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, we're back.	CHITCHAT
We're on it and we are going to have some fun today and I think some lazy exploration of Cinema 4D hopefully.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully you enjoy the ride and by kind of bumbling stumbling through it.	CHITCHAT
It.	CHITCHAT
What can I say?	CHITCHAT
Um symbol 40 is not my my application of choice and the light version doesn't have all the bells and whistles, so sometimes I feel a little bit a little bit hamstrung in there so hopefully hopefully you're fine.	CHITCHAT
Hang out with me for that process.	CHITCHAT
It's all learning process.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure people remember about last week.	CHITCHAT
Last week I was messing around and trying to make like a like a little scene.	O
In after effects, click some sconces and like a wall and.	O
They're going to open that up, let's see.	O
Most this it I don't know.	O
Let's find out.	CHITCHAT
Cough cough.	CHITCHAT
So this is something that we made a while ago.	O
I think it was last week that we were working on this and I was thinking this morning.	O
That There is a lot about this that.	O
Could be done better, maybe not better, but um, easier uhm?	O
Easier for us if we made this just in Cinema 4D.	O
'cause I was thinking like well I kinda want reactive lighting from this to be bouncing off of geometry and stuff.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe maybe actually doing it in 3D would be a more interesting way to do it.	O
Ooh and oh so many people hang out in the chat today what do we got here?	O
Call Timo team was in the house.	O
Oh man, getting his own bake like a pro hanging out.	O
Booty movie made a case study that's awesome.	O

Also, I don't know if people are able to post the links in the chat.	O
I hope I hope that you are 'cause I would love to see the presentation of that.	O
Not obvious Oh no.	CHITCHAT
It's OK, Hey, put your case studies wherever you want, but be hands is a lovely place to do so and Adobe portfolio.	O
If I could say, well, we're here.	CHITCHAT
If you don't have a portfolio site, give that a try.	CHITCHAT
I should I should redo my website because it is currently a trash fire.	CHITCHAT
There have been some formatting problems for over a year, but I have done nothing about it anyway.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, check out if you're hanging out with us in the checkout teamos link because it is great to see.	CHITCHAT

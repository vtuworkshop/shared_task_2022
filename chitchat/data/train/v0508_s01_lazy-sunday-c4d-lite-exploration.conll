Timo, you also have the best taste in mechanical pencils, so just so you know, Oh my goodness.	O
Yes, Oh well, I love this.	CHITCHAT
That's so good.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
So do do.	CHITCHAT
Let's get into some work.	CHITCHAT
Let's do some stuff and let's like I said, let's play around in.	O
Let's play around in Cinema 4D light and see what we do.	O
So I'm going to try to kind of recreate this kind of a thing and we're going to see is that easy?	O
Is it not easy?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know.	CHITCHAT
Look at.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to tell people to overspend on writing implements, but as someone who is.	O
Constantly using the tools that hang around and hang around my desk, you know it's something that I tried to invest in if possible.	O
So let's see, let's see.	CHITCHAT
I like working with square gifts.	CHITCHAT
How much you can take us to 30 frames a second for a few reasons, I think that's what Instagram likes.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know anymore, but I'm going to do 10 seconds.	CHITCHAT
10 seconds at 30.	CHITCHAT
So when we are.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be working across different softwares.	O
It's really useful to just take a few notes for yourself, so we're working in 30 frames a second, 1080 by 1080.	O
1010 seconds of stuff so we can assume there are 300 frames.	O
So you know, we know, OK, we got 300 frames going on it's 30 FPS.	O
I'm taking physical notes on a physical piece of paper.	O
For anyone wondering, I use the Uni Kuru Toga which is a wonderful wonderful mechanical pencil.	O
Has this feature where it rotates the lead over the Graphite every time you poke it down on the paper cause mutava constantly Sharp Graphite which is wonderful and we are one to one.	O
1080 so, like almost at my critical stats, written down so when I go creating something in my eye, something in another bit of software, whether we were bouncing into.	O
Mocha, or whether we're going to bounce into cinema 4D or wherever we're going to go.	O
Making sure everything lines up, I think is pretty critical.	O
So I'm going to go new.	O
Max Anstie 40 file.	O
We're going to see if the program explodes.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
We're going to make a new folder here.	O
It's going to be June.	O
Resist June 21.	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Untitled, I don't think so.	CHITCHAT
And this is like DND doorway is what we were doing last time, so we're going to continue that.	O
Oh no, 'cause I had to update things now it's going to give me problems.	O
I don't want it.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to deal.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to deal.	CHITCHAT
Come on now.	CHITCHAT
Looks like it was OK.	CHITCHAT
So oh some anonymous application activity it would like to have a look at that.	O
So we are graced, I suppose with semaphore delight.	O
Uh, What is this?	CHITCHAT
I don't want it.	CHITCHAT
I want to do updates.	CHITCHAT
Come on now.	CHITCHAT
Come on now I don't want people to hang out.	CHITCHAT
what I have to do updates.	CHITCHAT
I'll update later, OK?	CHITCHAT
Oh well hello Hello a good good to see people hanging out so many returning returning people here Scotts in the mix piddies back Zenas back.	CHITCHAT
Asks Wonderful, Wonderful Ken's here.	CHITCHAT
Now everyone's everyone's in the mix today.	CHITCHAT

Here's some of them now.	CHITCHAT

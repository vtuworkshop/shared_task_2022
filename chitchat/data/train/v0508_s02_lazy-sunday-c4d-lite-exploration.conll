I think it's interesting I don't have as much of a problem differentiating between things.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I liked the rainbow.	O
I enjoyed the cornucopia of things.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't totally understand the logic, but.	O
Personally, if it was up to me They would all be unique shapes and unique colors like one of them would be a triangle.	O
One of them would be a hexagon, but what are you gonna do?	O
You know, let's clearly there was a meeting and.	O
Some people did some things.	CHITCHAT
That's about all I can say, so I want to make an archway.	O
I wanna make an archway a gateway.	O
What is the scene that we are making?	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's think for a minute.	CHITCHAT
So I think in rough terms we're going to plop a plane where my plane go.	O
There it is.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's see we have a ground good for us.	O
OK, How do I want to make the gateway?	O
What I'm thinking about that.	O
There's a few ways I might make it.	O
Few ways.	CHITCHAT
I could make a cube.	O
Why should I mean there's like infinite ways that you could make something so we could make like.	O
And at that.	CHITCHAT
So we could just assemble it out of some blocks like we could do that like we're playing with Lego.	O
Who who doesn't like playing with Lego, right?	O
Uh-huh We could copy and make another one.	O
Right and then we got this gate open.	O
How did I miss that?	CHITCHAT
How big are these?	CHITCHAT
Poop.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
Big plane OK.	O
What I'm trying to do is to think about.	O
Just some of the basic stuff of this you know, like like What is this thing going to?	O
I guess some lines out here, but yeah my hot take on the icons, they're OK I guess.	O
Some ancient Greek pillars, so that would be fun.	O
Hold on, let me write that down.	CHITCHAT
That might be an upgrade for later.	O
Peelers What do you think in what do you think of Mac?	O
Or do you think it's, uh, some Doric pillars some Corinthian pillars?	O
There is a lot to be thought in terms of.	O
Like No, not like that, uh?	O
I was constantly do the one that I don't want to do first.	O
You know, like?	CHITCHAT
Like is this the kind of a door frame?	O
That would be interested in I don't know.	O
'cause I'm thinking?	O
Minecraft Ian pillars.	O
Sick burn Timo?	CHITCHAT
What's really nice about some of this geometry here is that we can do things like.	O
Let's put a band on it.	O
Um, what else do we have bens bulge?	O
Fear taper twists?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Think.	CHITCHAT
And so if I want to start bending this First off, I'm bending in the wrong direction.	O
Protected Click and we're not going to see any bending because we need more segments.	O
It's not going to be enough.	O

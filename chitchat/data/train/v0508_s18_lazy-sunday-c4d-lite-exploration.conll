Um?	CHITCHAT
Switch instances this.	O
OK, this is door instance.	O
And put it on my door.	O
And the torches, though I did not make us instances.	O
Maybe I should, I don't know, um.	O
No, too many too much light.	O
Why would there be that much light?	CHITCHAT
This is meant to be bonded us.	O
It's meant to be ominous.	O
Now the real critical quests, June Christian is a lock.	O
We don't have a lock on this thing.	CHITCHAT
We need to get a lock on this thing.	O
I mean, the door also doesn't have hinges, so I don't really know what we can take away from that.	O
When I think about this project, though as a whole, it feels more and more like it should be in 3D or it should be modeled in this way.	O
If I could build it out of Popsicle sticks, that might be the ideal version of this.	O
If I could have a little diorama that I could like, push a tiny micro camera through, maybe that would be the way to do it.	O
Yeah, can't do I want to have different lights in color or intensity.	O
I do so like ideally we're definitely not going to get to this today.	O
This is something I will fumble through without subjecting you all to it, but I would want them both to like pulse independently like flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker.	O
This one may be going crazy and then this one's going crazy like.	O
You know that they should be, you know, separate and unique things, right?	O
The belt ever.	O
This is the best way to demonstrate this with your hands, but yeah, they could be unique colors that could be unique intensities that could be unique.	O
Flick arena's happening with them.	O
That's the idea anyway, that they could be unique and interesting things in that way.	O
Because I really think.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Just to give you an example.	O
How much lighting plays into mood?	O
You know now the mood on my face is a little bit more extreme, right?	O
You might think.	CHITCHAT
Evans going a little bit crazy now just because of the way the lighting situation is, but now it's evenly lit and very pleasant.	O
So by being able to mess with lighting intensity and lighting situations were able to change.	O
The way people feel about something anyway.	O
I I literally installed these lights only to do that.	O
And took us when I play Dungeons and Dragons on the Internet.	O
I want to be dramatic.	CHITCHAT
Uma corn is asking, can you make the wall a bit rougher at the top?	CHITCHAT
Yes, yes.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about I have been.	O
Having a ponderance about how to do this.	O
Noir, Evan, indeed.	CHITCHAT
Well, it seemed like a case like any other.	O
Oh, make sure but wanted to wanted to leave the room.	O
I'm wondering how to what might be the best way to do that?	O
What might be the best way?	O
To make that happen.	O
I'm just thinking out loud.	O
Because variation and manipulation of things are are some of the things that.	O
You know I could.	CHITCHAT
Maybe do a sweep of something across the top I could do.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I have the mograph fracture.	O
I could I could just take one of these walls.	O
OK, let's take one of these walls.	O
Let's give it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
10 and 10K.	O

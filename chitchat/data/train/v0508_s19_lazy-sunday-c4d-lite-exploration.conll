And then.	CHITCHAT
We could take the wall and we could just make editable.	O
Then I could grab the points.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
What?	CHITCHAT
Sale Well.	CHITCHAT
Kelly, that maybe?	CHITCHAT
Is this anything?	CHITCHAT
Where did that wall go?	CHITCHAT
And put it down here and.	O
Appan this wall?	CHITCHAT
Or we could even was great is now I could put a little hole in the bottom of the wall.	O
Block So subdivision surface.	O
I don't think we've talked about this.	O
The subdivision surface helps me smooth smooth things out by adding more subdivisions.	O
So for example, the wall is made of these things.	O
This is actually kind of the WAVY wall that I was trying to.	O
Achieve a little bit ago, so maybe this is the way to go.	O
I don't know you don't know, but it does allow you to have like a wave which is cool.	O
All well, because this is a fantasy thing.	O
It could be, it could be.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It could be like a like a like an undulating waves constantly.	O
Who who who?	CHITCHAT
OK, let me maybe we do some experiments with this other wall.	O
Hold on.	O
OK, 1010 car.	O
Thinking about.	CHITCHAT
Oh That's that.	CHITCHAT
OK, so sorry, I just put something called the formula to former up on this wall, which is great.	O
And you know, as you can see, it is now putting sine wave.	O
Through the thing which was fun, I don't think that's really what I wanted.	O
It was cool though I did I did find it very cool.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
I do like symmetry in this.	CHITCHAT
I like that this is a very symmetrical thing, so maybe we stick with that would be to keep having to do.	O
Is there really no mirror in here?	O
Is this for real?	CHITCHAT
This is where I'm at.	CHITCHAT
This is what's happening to my Life OK?	O
Anyway, now they'll both be mirrored.	O
Building high Ah yeah.	O
Do do do.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
1st.	CHITCHAT
Hey.	CHITCHAT
Who wants to have some fun with materials I'm hanging up for another 15 minutes here?	O
Let's.	CHITCHAT
Let's take the top off of this thing up.	O
I mean, it already looks perfect already, I don't know.	O

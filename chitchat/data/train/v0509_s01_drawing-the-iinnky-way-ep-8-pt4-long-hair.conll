But that generally comes on its own.	O
That same concept can be said for her.	O
You know when you're drawing when you're doing your hair, there's like typical hairstyles that everybody does right?	O
And there's typical ways that everybody likes to teach her.	O
But The keys have fun with it.	O
There's so many different hairstyles in the world, there's literally no way to just generally teach you how to draw her.	O
There's a couple basic tips.	O
That people can give, but you the only way to really, truly learn her is to get in there and get your hands.	O
Very one of the biggest things that I learned in my journey of drawing hair is that here is one giant Mass.	O
It is definitely not individual strands.	O
When we first start drawing, we have this nasty habit of drawing tiny strands of hair in the shapes are in the motion of the hair that we're trying to create.	O
That is a bad idea.	CHITCHAT
It stresses you out.	CHITCHAT
You tend to over detail, which is something that a lot of beginning artists do, because when we were in the beginning stages we we relate detail too.	O
You know, like skill set.	O
And your ability to add detail in a drawing or what not does not does not indicate skill set.	O
Skill set is based on your efficiency in my opinion.	O
Now again, this is all opinionated.	O
I am just one artist.	O
We all learn differently, but in my opinion, skill set is basically based on efficiency and accuracy.	O
So the more the more accurate you are.	O
And more efficient you are at being accurate, accurate.	O
It will determine how you feel about your skill set, 'cause I realize that.	O
When I first started drawing.	CHITCHAT
All I cared about was getting accuracy.	CHITCHAT
You know, like is this going to look like what I wanted to look like.	CHITCHAT
It was like the biggest issue that always had was like manage this.	CHITCHAT
Actually going to look like what I want it to look like.	CHITCHAT
I mean I know I can draw it and everything but like after is drawn like.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Was it really gonna look like it?	CHITCHAT
Never really does look like what you intend to 100% make it look like you just kind of go along with it.	O
You know when you're first starting out.	CHITCHAT
But then afterwards as I started getting better and better at art and I started drawing more and more things over more and more time, it started getting to the point where I was more concerned about how fast I was, along with how accurate things were.	CHITCHAT
It was it just wasn't good enough to be accurate.	CHITCHAT
I had to be accurate in fast because if I wasn't fast I felt like I was wasting my time because we we start watching other artists and stuff like that and we see how fast and efficient they are an we automatically relate what?	CHITCHAT
They do to what we should be doing, which is a very bad idea.	CHITCHAT
You know when you're learning how to do art, you never.	CHITCHAT
You never, ever ever base your skill set off somebody else's skillset.	CHITCHAT
Though, even though I say that every artist does that, it just.	CHITCHAT
It's for some reason they just they migrate to it, you know, and it's a really bad thing to get over when you're first starting and it can cause a lot of stress and anxiety.	CHITCHAT
You know it could make you feel like what you're doing isn't worth it.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of beings.	CHITCHAT
And as I started becoming better and better at art, I notice that I stopped caring about.	CHITCHAT
Anything more than?	CHITCHAT
My knowledge of the skill set.	CHITCHAT
Which is what I actually love, because before I didn't really necessarily care about my skill set, all I cared about was people liking what I did, which.	CHITCHAT
To be to be without a present truthful, there is always going to be someone out there that likes your work, so you need not worry about that.	CHITCHAT
There is absolutely 100% going to be someone out there somewhere in the world no matter what your skill level is is going to like your work.	CHITCHAT
You know, I know.	CHITCHAT
I know everybody is in this rat race to become super popular and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
But popularity should always be the last thing you're looking for when it comes to art and why I say that is because if you're looking to be popular early on, generally it's Tide to something else you know.	CHITCHAT
Generally, you're tying that popularity into something else that you want.	CHITCHAT
And you think that you can attain it without popularity?	CHITCHAT
I used to be like that with tattooing.	CHITCHAT
I've been tattooing for 19 years and one of the biggest things that I wanted when I first started tattooing was popularity, and it wasn't popularity for the sake of being popular.	CHITCHAT

So you try to Draw Something that's super epic, so you can.	CHITCHAT
You know you can, you can make everybody in the room make their jaw hit the floor and.	CHITCHAT
What you realize is.	CHITCHAT
Crap.	CHITCHAT
Every single time around somebody I can't seem to draw an.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why, you know, and I make myself look real bad because everybody else is killing it.	CHITCHAT
And I'm sitting there doing nothing.	CHITCHAT
You know it.	CHITCHAT
A lot of that comes from the fact that you First off you do your best creativity when you're on your own.	CHITCHAT
Being able to draw in front of somebody else does not make you a better artist.	CHITCHAT
Actually, nothing in general makes you a better artist other than you feeling like you are better than you were the day before.	CHITCHAT
The way that someone else feels about your art isn't going to change the way that you feel.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause.	CHITCHAT
Ultimately, you will be happy in that moment.	CHITCHAT
But then, once those people are gone, that feeling goes with them.	CHITCHAT
So someone tells you that you're super good and you should chase this dream and you know all of that.	CHITCHAT
If that person isn't there to tell you every single day, you start drifting slowly and slowly back to that point where you feel like.	CHITCHAT
Why am I doing this?	CHITCHAT
You will have this all the time in art forever, where you feel like you're a fraud, no matter how good you get, no matter how far you go.	CHITCHAT
If you can't reach the level of the artist that you you.	CHITCHAT
Have watched.	CHITCHAT
And you worship or whatever you.	CHITCHAT
Will always feel inadequate in you.	CHITCHAT
Always feel like what you're doing isn't worth doing and you've wasted all at a time you know and what you want to basically do is you want to try to limit that you never going to be able to stop it, you just want to limit.	CHITCHAT
You want to limit it.	CHITCHAT
You know practicing helps a lot because practicing takes away that a dead desire to want to be good because you're.	CHITCHAT
That's why you're practicing.	CHITCHAT
You know, if you suck while you're practicing, it's like, well, that's why I'm practicing it.	CHITCHAT
You not trying to create a piece of art and the artist failing.	CHITCHAT
And you're giving up because you can't do it.	CHITCHAT
Practice is literally the you know the.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Is the.	CHITCHAT
I can't think of the damn word.	CHITCHAT
It's the art of failing and fixing your failures or trying to make your failures less well.	CHITCHAT
You know failed.	CHITCHAT
You know when you're.	CHITCHAT
When you're sitting here practicing like I'm practicing her right now, I know how to draw her.	CHITCHAT
But me practicing her is going to make it a little bit more efficient, and it's also going to help other people, you know.	CHITCHAT
But there's a lot of times where I will draw her that I think that I can draw an I just don't like the way it comes out.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what the heck I did wrong, and I'm sitting there fighting with myself.	CHITCHAT
About why the hair looks the way that it doesn't, you know or why I can't get this to look a specific way.	CHITCHAT
And all of these different things.	CHITCHAT
Like all of these different hairstyles and stuff like that, there is something that you can actually you can actually learn or that I actually learned from being an artist is that if you look at an artist work.	CHITCHAT
Next to each other like this you could almost see the ones that they struggled with versus the ones that were easy.	CHITCHAT
The ones that were easy seem to be a lot lighter and less.	CHITCHAT
Busy as far as like sketch lines, the more the more I had to sketch.	CHITCHAT
The more I wasn't confident in what I was doing I was sculpting.	CHITCHAT
When you know you're sculpting is a lot more cleaner you know, is that way when you draw a lot of things that you normally draw a lot and it's that way when you when you when you're confident in your steps.	CHITCHAT
At least that way for me.	CHITCHAT
The more confident that I am, the less.	CHITCHAT
That I have to go over what I'm doing, you know which is.	CHITCHAT
Definitely a huge huge thing only on 55, so I make my my canvases multiples of 5th of multiples of 11 1/2 by 17.	CHITCHAT
So I make the sheets of paper or I make the sheets you no longer by multiples of.	CHITCHAT
Like 11.	CHITCHAT
So that if people wanted to cut this up in.	CHITCHAT
Like add to it or print it out or whatever crap.	CHITCHAT
I know I went through.	CHITCHAT
I was like why didn't I get any bigger?	CHITCHAT
'cause I made it go to row.	CHITCHAT
I thought I clicked it and I didn't.	CHITCHAT
So usually when I do my canvases and stuff like that.	O
I always make them go.	O
Like multiples of 11.	O
So that when people if people want to print this out, that would be out of printed out on 11 1/2 by 17 paper, you know and have relatively large.	O
Relatively large print out that they can work with and stuff like that.	O

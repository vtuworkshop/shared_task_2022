I draw this eyeball like all the time like what is?	O
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
Today I was getting.	CHITCHAT
I started getting upset like you know, like I don't understand it.	CHITCHAT
You know like I'm Trump drawing this, I draw it all the time but for some strange reason.	O
Today is eyeball just isn't working.	O
And I'm starting to get 'cause I'm like, I I I'm I'm really like.	CHITCHAT
I really don't want to spend too much time on this.	CHITCHAT
I really need to get this eyeball right.	O
Like, you know, like the heck like I did it yesterday.	CHITCHAT
Like stupid hands do what I tell you to do right so?	CHITCHAT
After like the 10th or 12th try, I lose it like absolutely lose it.	CHITCHAT
You know I'm like, screw this.	CHITCHAT
I hey art this is dumb like I don't know why I'm spending my time doing this like this is just.	CHITCHAT
Like it was, it was one of them.	CHITCHAT
Date I flipped my I flip my desk over, I slap my equipment on floor, you know.	CHITCHAT
Again, I'm by myself now, like from Sydney I'm slapping slap my stuff on the floor and I just have a complete like meltdown.	CHITCHAT
I'm just like you gotta be kidding me.	CHITCHAT
I can't believe I can draw this.	CHITCHAT
I like this is so stupid like I don't understand how everybody else does it so easily and I'm just like I don't get it, you know, and I'm like I've been.	CHITCHAT
I've been doing this for like I don't know how many years and like I just don't understand how my friends and stuff do it with ease.	CHITCHAT
I just wanna do it with these, you know.	CHITCHAT
And I remember it was disposed right here.	CHITCHAT
It was indisposed exactly like this, and I didn't have the T bar and all of that, and I didn't have the.	CHITCHAT
Again, I wasn't doing sketching an I wasn't doing breaking things down in the basic shapes, I was doing what most artists do when we first start out.	CHITCHAT
You just jump in and you draw like a printer where you draw from the top to bottom where I had got to the point where I was drawing and I and it was I had.	CHITCHAT
I had drawn this, I right here.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause I mean, it was pretty much the same eye that had already had already drawn, you know.	CHITCHAT
And I was trying to figure out how to draw this.	CHITCHAT
I over here, which it is very hard for people to do when your.	CHITCHAT
When you're learning how to draw drawing, drawing the three quarter I on the far side is more difficult than you could possibly imagine when you don't necessarily understand three quarter shapes you know, or three quarter vision or whatever you want to call it, like when you can't understand.	CHITCHAT
How drawing something in three quarter view works it?	CHITCHAT
Could it could drive you nuts which it was driving me crazy 'cause I'm like I can't.	CHITCHAT
I can't I don't get it, you know?	CHITCHAT
I swear to you, at this moment I was like.	CHITCHAT
Why won't let me let me let me let me switch layers?	CHITCHAT
I was like.	CHITCHAT
What?	CHITCHAT
No switch area.	CHITCHAT
I was like why?	CHITCHAT
Why can't I do this eyeball?	CHITCHAT
It's so simple like I don't understand it.	CHITCHAT
Why can't I just draw an almond shape and then put a circle in it?	CHITCHAT
and I I stopped right there and I was just like Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
'cause at that moment?	CHITCHAT
Something that I've been told my entire life made since.	CHITCHAT
My friends, my teachers, everybody would always tell me that art is simple.	CHITCHAT
It's all made up of basic shapes.	CHITCHAT
The better you understand those shapes, the better you will be at drawing.	CHITCHAT
and I used to always be like that is just the stupidest thing I've ever heard my life.	CHITCHAT
That is just the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life like it did.	CHITCHAT
This just lines.	CHITCHAT
There's no way that these things are made up of shapes like you expect me to draw circles and squares all over the place until it becomes really good.	CHITCHAT
I don't believe that.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do it differently and for the life of me I could not.	CHITCHAT
Wrapped my head around that until that very moment and at that moment I was like Oh my God so you're meaning to tell him you mean to tell me that all of the problems that I was going through.	CHITCHAT
We're literally because.	CHITCHAT
I didn't pre sketch my work and I didn't use basic shapes so I drew the I like several times.	CHITCHAT
I remember 'cause it was just this.	CHITCHAT
It was just this.	CHITCHAT
I just kept doing this, you know, and then I was drawn the other side.	CHITCHAT
Once you know I was just I just kept doing this over and over.	CHITCHAT
And I'm like, Are you kidding me?	CHITCHAT
And then I started drawing eyes straightforward where I would just draw Allman shapes like that, you know.	CHITCHAT
And I'm like, you know, putting the putting the eyeball in.	CHITCHAT
I'm like I'm hitting it out the park, right?	CHITCHAT
And I'm like you gotta be kidding me.	CHITCHAT

You're telling me that all this time?	CHITCHAT
What they were basically telling me to do?	CHITCHAT
Was.	CHITCHAT
Two pre sketch your drawings as basic shapes and add detail.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of stuff that I have been told automatically made sense because I said OK, now I know why I don't understand what they were saying.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't that they were explaining it wrong, it was that my feeble brain could not interpret the way that they were explaining it.	CHITCHAT
I was listening to it as something else.	CHITCHAT
And I couldn't interpret what they meant, you know?	CHITCHAT
And that was kind of where I was at when it came to drawing anything.	CHITCHAT
You know, it was just like I in my brain.	CHITCHAT
I'm like I don't get with it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what they're talking about.	CHITCHAT
They keep talking about basic shapes and this and that.	CHITCHAT
And all of these artists.	CHITCHAT
Things that I didn't understand and.	CHITCHAT
It's something that always stuck with me in my whole entire life was like whenever I hear somebody explain something to someone, I'm thinking like this person is probably not going to get it because their brain doesn't understand what this person is talking about.	CHITCHAT
They haven't.	CHITCHAT
They haven't gotten to the point where they understand what these terms mean.	CHITCHAT
You know, like if someone says everything is made of a basic shapes our brain infinite are automatically goes to circle, square, rectangle, triangle, you know.	CHITCHAT
And literally what it goes to every single time Circle, Square, rectangle, triangle that no one is telling you that the basic shapes aren't actually the basic shapes, it is just the most basic shape you can get to.	CHITCHAT
So that you can remember what you're drawing.	CHITCHAT
So now let me let me let me let me go a little bit further in depth with that because.	CHITCHAT
This is something that would always this is.	CHITCHAT
This is generally where I'm usually at when.	CHITCHAT
I would always get frustrated, you know, and I'm like everything is made of a basic saves right?	CHITCHAT
And of course everybody's like yeah when you know, like whatever like.	CHITCHAT
Take something like, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Actually, you know the octopus will serve pretty well for this is Andrew will take out will take my octopus test sheet.	CHITCHAT
And I'll tell you everything is made up of basic shapes.	CHITCHAT
The red in all of my all of my tests that you see because I do these things every day.	CHITCHAT
The red that you see in my testes are the most basic shapes that I come up with to identify how to draw this specific theme.	CHITCHAT
Let me find that actually, let me get the actual PNG out.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to erase everything else but.	CHITCHAT
No one explained that to me.	CHITCHAT
Everybody was just basically telling me everything was made of a basic save, so of course you know when you first start drawing and you're doing your anatomy studies, you get that Loomis book or whatever, and it's breaking things down into rectangles and boxes.	CHITCHAT
And all of that stuff is what confuses.	CHITCHAT
The average person because you're thinking I need to draw boxes and circles and squares and all that stuff for everything that you're doing.	CHITCHAT
Where in all actuality, this is not a known shape.	CHITCHAT
This is a combination of shapes to make something that's familiar.	O
What they're literally telling you is.	O
You're trying to create the most basic form.	O
That will help you remember how to draw what everything you're drawing.	O
The more simple it has to be for you to remember, the more simple you make it.	O
You know this right here is not a shape you couldn't give this.	O
You can name it whatever you want, but it doesn't have an actual name in the spectral shapes.	O
It's just a combination of shapes put together to make something.	O
But this is the most basic shape.	O
That I could come up with to describe how I drew this.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
The whole purpose of fundamentals.	O
Which is something that would have saved me 20 something years of study.	O
Is to teach your hands to work with your brain.	O
You're teaching your hands to understand what your brain is telling it.	O
You know, so if they're telling you to draw tentacle and you don't know where to start.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
Is what your brain goes too, so that you can build detail on top of it.	O
Same with all of these things you know.	O
Same with this.	CHITCHAT
This is like it makes no sense to anybody else but your brain, because these are your shapes.	CHITCHAT
You know these are the things that you go to to help you start drawing this particular creature at this particular pose.	CHITCHAT
You all, and then you once you.	O
Once you get good enough, you can take the simplest of shapes you know that will help you draw this character and you can move it in your mind.	CHITCHAT

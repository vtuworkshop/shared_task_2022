In 3D.	O
So now you don't necessarily have to draw 8 million different poses, you now can you now have the basic shape of the back of this thing's head.	O
The front of the things had the Eyeballs, and now you can just move it to whatever position you want.	O
So now you can just turn it.	O
Any any way you want?	O
From any position that you want and add Alittle same elements to it and make this character and draw it all out and stuff like that you can now do that on your own.	O
Without Having to look at reference or anything like that, you know, like it makes it 10 times easier to you know.	O
Do it is the same thing with like drawing heads and stuff you know.	O
Moving his head and all these different positions and stuff like that, it's still just ahead.	O
The basic shape of my head is an upside down egg shape that's the most basic shape of my head that when I draw heads, this is the most basic shape that I come up with.	O
Is that shape right there?	O
That's it, that is the most basic shape that I come up with, so.	O
If I were to explain to somebody else how to draw heads, that was be.	O
That would be the most simple explanation, and then of course they probably wouldn't get it.	O
Be like in upside, down and shape they would keep drawing an egg and every position, but almost like when they would draw the egg shaped would always look the same.	O
So now you need.	CHITCHAT
Now you need a reference guide so you I have this thing right here where is literally just a bunch of positions.	O
You put your head in using the same basic shape.	O
Just turned in a different direction, you know?	O
And then and then as far as to make a little bit more sense to people that all of this is based on one simple shape which is the shape of an egg.	O
All I'm basically doing.	CHITCHAT
Is taking this egg.	O
And then adding lines to guide which wherever I want the head to be at, you know.	O
What, no matter where you, no matter where I position it is still in upside down egg.	O
You just move the upside down egg to the position you want, and then you use these past lines, which I didn't necessarily know what they did with these lines.	O
I just know that they had him, but the lines are to orientate your brain so that you don't forget that this is where this person is looking.	O
You know all of this stuff is to do.	O
One thing is the speed you up.	O
To make you more efficient why you need to be more efficient because your brain is ever changing.	O
You ever have an idea when you're out, but when you get home you forget it.	O
You ever you ever have a really cool concept star drawing?	O
And by the time you get to the end of it is something different or you forget what you're doing and you change it or whatever is because your brain, your brain is forever constantly changing its spot in the way that is 'cause.	O
It's so much stuff going in and out of it and so much stuff is storing or whatever.	O
That your brain will shift.	O
What's your original concept?	O
Isn't it will morph into something else that the idea of speed drawing is to get?	O
Is to get what you have in your brain on paper as fast as possible so your brain can focus, and that's generally what people mean when they say focus is to keep your brain from wandering to something else.	O
It will do it automatically where you will sit here and you will draw face for so long and then all of a sudden you want to draw horns on this face when you didn't want to before.	O
You just think that well, in this particular position these horns look great.	O
I think I I think I want to put horns on this and it's like why don't?	O
Why do?	CHITCHAT
Why do I want to put horns on this all of a sudden?	O
Horns aren't going to work, you know, but it will work because your brain is telling you it's kind of like cooler.	O
So you add horns and it's like, well, my original concept didn't call for horns, but.	O
We're putting horns.	O
And then all of a sudden it's like, well, this was going to be a girl, but now it's going to be a sentar because for some reason this would look cooler if I drew it as a horse.	O
But then that's the problem, because now you start dreaming bigger and you can't draw that fast and you start.	O
You start drawing things wrong and you started not liking stuff.	O
And now the whole interpret the whole original concept that you were drawing, which is literally going to be just a girl standing there holding an ice cream is now a sentar running through a forest.	O
You know doing whatever because you took too long to draw.	O
Now you get your concept down on paper really quick.	O
Your brain can't can't change stuff.	O
Your brain will literally just be stuck on the original concept.	O

You may make improvements on the anatomy in which you're drawing or whatever, and or the scenes or whatever, but your brain will stay stuck.	O
On that original concept, because now it has something to grab onto.	O
Also, it helps to draw, you know, like say you walk away and you come back.	O
It helps to bring that memory of what you thought about back because now you have a quick sketch and say you say you start drawing it.	O
I write you drawing a really detailed I and this I is going to be a part of.	O
I don't know the Mona Lisa.	O
But you walk away and you eat dinner and you go watch the TV show and you come back.	O
And it's just an eye there gonna be like what was I4.	O
I I know it was supposed to be for some woman or something, but I don't remember what the I was for.	O
I just I what was I doing?	CHITCHAT
Well this really looks cool, so I'm going to take this.	O
I and now that I drew it, I don't know what is for going to make a cyclops.	O
'cause I mean it's and I obviously I was drawing a slide clouds right?	O
Why it why else would I just have a random one?	O
I, you know, that's what your brain does, you know?	O
You ever think back you ever look at Old artwork and you think why the hell did I draw this?	O
What was I thinking about?	CHITCHAT
This is so stupid at the time it wasn't stupid at the time was awesome.	O
You know 'cause your brain wanted to draw that at the time you know.	O
And a lot of it is just a lot of a lot of what I draw when I'm younger or when I was younger.	O
Was things that I saw that I thought was cool, that I could not draw.	O
I kept.	CHITCHAT
I kept trying to redraw things that I couldn't draw when I was younger after I had my breakthrough.	O
You know, every artist will have their breakthrough.	O
Doesn't matter what you do in that breakthrough happens.	O
I always try to explain to people that have breakthrough isn't learning how to draw hands 'cause they're like.	O
Oh, I had to break the other day, and I learned how to draw hands and I'm like that's not a breakthrough when you have a breakthrough.	O
It's not learning how to draw hands is learning the meaning of drawing.	O
Or how to draw.	O
You know it's not just drawing hands, it's me.	O
It means you can draw anything now because you understand.	O
The basic concept of how to construct anything.	O
The basic concepts of how to construct anything for me was basic shapes, which was fundamentals was understanding how to break things down into a simplest form and rebuild it.	O
You know it could be something as complicated as a charge building, or simple as hairstyles you know like something like this.	O
You could look at an image and then you can reconstruct it the way you want because your brain is breaking it down into basic shapes and you're redrawing it.	O
Hair is not.	O
Individual strands hair is a mass.	O
You hear this a lot, but even up on you, even though even though you hear it a lot.	O
People still do the same thing every single time you know you will.	O
You will catch yourself when you first start off doing this, and if you don't catch yourself you will you will.	O
You will hate every bit of her.	O
You draw back in the back.	O
In the 90s people just thought it was OK to draw like that.	O
And if I mean it was just was the 90s, this is what we did in the 90s where you know we would draw and then what we would do is we would draw the shape of ahead.	O
You know when we get our details down our face or whatever you know, just go ahead and rough in some face or features.	O
But then what we would do is we would just sculpt out.	O
Our hairstyles And we would always be like why isn't our hair looking good?	O
Why does it here always look like crap and looks overly rendered in it at the same time?	O
It looks like it's not rendered at all young with that concept, right?	O
Where it looks like you overly rendered something, but it just looks like it's not finished.	O
That Early.	O
80s like GI Joe?	O
I don't necessarily know what you wanna call it.	O
Kind of here where it just it looked it just it looked like Hanna Barbera.	O
If anybody knows ahead of Barbera cartoons, are it just looked like everything just looked?	O
Like Finished with nothing but I didn't like how to Barbera cartoons, you know.	O
But That's The thing is like when you're drawing her.	O
That's something that you have to remember is hair is.	O
A giant mass.	O
Of shapes You know, or a giant mass of a sheep you know.	O
This is generally what your this is.	O
Generally what your hairstyle is.	O
You know when you sit down to draw a hairstyle.	O
This is generally what you're looking for right there.	O
Just this.	CHITCHAT
This is this that is the hairstyle and then you go in and you add a few details to show direction.	O
You're high, you're high level of details comes in in the colour stage.	O

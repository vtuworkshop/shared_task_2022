I'm not gonna.	CHITCHAT
I'm not gonna do this like whatever.	O
Show me how to draw teddy bears so I can write this.	O
You know this letter and make a mix tape from a girlfriend.	O
You know, like show me how to do that.	O
Let me show me how to draw graffiti style so that I could make graffiti from my friends and get lots of praise.	O
Everybody wants to know how to draw better.	O
Whatever's popular so that they can show off, even though you will say it's not.	O
It's like everything you do is the better you get, the more you want to show people I'm getting better.	O
Look at me, get better, tell me how good I am forgetting better when you're young in art.	O
Not young in general in young in the art.	O
That's kind of how your brain is like.	O
You are so excited that you're getting better.	CHITCHAT
It's like I need to show people that I'm getting better even though you will be told it's not about that and you shouldn't be focused on that.	O
You're like, yeah, right?	CHITCHAT
I'm totally.	CHITCHAT
Totally about the show, you know?	CHITCHAT
Bobby from my from my twelve grade art class that I still follow on Instagram that I am not dog crap at art anymore that I am ready to take him on.	CHITCHAT
But now Bobby has gotten better.	CHITCHAT
And Bobby is like, yeah, that's great but I'm I'm I'm doing 3D modeling now.	CHITCHAT
You know like that's cool that you're good at art and like God.	CHITCHAT
God Dang it Bobby ha.	CHITCHAT
Now I gotta go and learn something else, you know and it's like you know I thought it was with my buddy.	CHITCHAT
I had to do this.	CHITCHAT
His friend had a friend.	CHITCHAT
His name is Alex.	CHITCHAT
Fun fact, I name my son Alexander.	CHITCHAT
I took on the alias Alexander when I was younger because.	CHITCHAT
I like this dude so much and my middle name just happened to be Alexander so I just started making people call me Alexander 'cause I just thought this do with so cool.	CHITCHAT
So now I have a son name Alexander.	CHITCHAT
By just the sheer coincidence that I was trying to.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Steal this guys Thunder.	CHITCHAT
You know so.	CHITCHAT
But This guy was like every time I would try to catch him he would jump it.	CHITCHAT
2 steps ahead of me, again by doing something different or something new like and he would just read a book.	CHITCHAT
Or, you know, watch a video or something like that and then be obsessed with it and then within like a month he would be doing whatever it was knew that he was trying to do.	CHITCHAT
And I used to always be like damn, never I'm never gonna catch this guy.	CHITCHAT
And then I started realizing like why am I, why am I always competing and why am I always chasing someone else in art?	CHITCHAT
Why is it?	CHITCHAT
Why is it this thing for me to just be better than somebody else or be as good as somebody else?	CHITCHAT
Why am I so concerned with being?	CHITCHAT
Accepted or on the same level as someone else when we don't do the same thing, you can't possibly be.	CHITCHAT
Like someone else, if you aren't in the same brain or on the same level as they are as far as like what they know.	CHITCHAT
If if that person gave you.	CHITCHAT
A concept to draw.	CHITCHAT
Your concept would not be the concept that he would draw, or she would draw.	CHITCHAT
It would always be different because your experiences are different.	CHITCHAT
Your brain is wired different, you just cannot produce the same kind of art even if you look at it.	CHITCHAT
And you do a one for one.	CHITCHAT
Replica of it.	CHITCHAT
It would take you extremely long to do something at that person.	CHITCHAT
Just did effortlessly.	CHITCHAT
So when you draw it like so say I'm drawing this hair all of these hairstyles and stuff like that, right?	CHITCHAT
If someone sat there and try to understand the style in which I was drawing my hair, it would take them.	CHITCHAT
At least two or three times longer than me, because I'm just doing it.	CHITCHAT
This is just the way that I draw.	CHITCHAT
I don't have to.	CHITCHAT
I don't have to convince myself of how I did this or try to figure out my subtle nuances and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
It's just how I draw.	CHITCHAT
It's like when I sit my pencil on the paper, my brain is making up.	CHITCHAT
Things that I like and putting them together the way that I liked him.	CHITCHAT
That's what my brain is doing as well.	CHITCHAT
That's how I'm operating.	CHITCHAT
A next is generally how that kind of stuff works.	CHITCHAT
I'm just literally sitting there piecing together.	O
How I like things like from the nose to the eyes too wide I choose to draw her face in this position to get this hairstyle when I could have drawn it in any other position.	O
Why this position?	O
You know why did I put a bow in the hair?	O
Why am I putting curls all over the place?	O
Why am I doing any of this stuff?	O
That's because my brain.	CHITCHAT
This is what my brain likes and this is what my brain is telling me to do at the time.	O
This is where my brain is telling me to put this little curly cue.	O
My brain is telling me to do all of these things where your brain will.	O

Probably tell you to put it somewhere else or don't put it at all.	O
Or do a different kind of curl you know, and this is what makes us unique in art.	O
Which basically means we cannot be the same kind of artist because we don't think the same.	O
We haven't been through the same experiences.	O
We haven't climbed the same hurdles a lot of us haven't even had some hurdles that we will have an art.	O
There's a lot of things that people experience that other people haven't that.	O
You know they may or may not ever experience.	O
And that's the thing that a lot of people just don't necessarily get when it comes to art is the more and more and more you keep trying.	O
To do something like someone else, the less and less and less you spend trying to do something like yourself.	O
You should spend 10 times more time trying to become the artist that you are intended to be rather than trying to be like someone else are as good as someone else are better than someone else.	O
The idea of being an artist is not to be better than someone else.	O
You know, is that age old concept that people think is boring that you're only trying to be better than the person you were the day before.	O
Meaning when you sit down to draw just like me when I get up every morning and I practice, I'm trying to do something better than the last time I did it.	O
You know, I draw all the time and every year I always take one day off of drawing and after that one day off of drawing I start over and I re evaluate how I drew stuff the year before.	O
So like I I have a test sheet that's Infinite.	O
That has hands and feet and like basic facial features and basic human anatomy.	O
'cause human anatomy is something that I will always struggle to be better at, so that's how I base my skill set.	O
You know, when I start over, those are the first things that I that I start working on as soon as I start over is OK.	O
This marks the beginning of my yearly journey and my whatever improvement this year.	O
I want to see how much better I am at hands in a year.	O
Before you know, I want to see if I could add anything new to the hands that I draw.	O
I want to make.	CHITCHAT
I want to make sure that I can draw, you know, faster and more efficient and I will go and pull up my old test sheets and then I will draw on the same test sheet.	O
What I've learned new to see what is mixed, what is new versus old?	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
So a lot of my test sheets.	O
That I do of like faces and stuff like that so like where's my?	O
I think I have a complete.	O
My complete female face thingy or whatever.	CHITCHAT
Where is it?	CHITCHAT
Complete complete face guide for females.	O
This is not a complete phase guide for females.	O
This is just what I had at the time I have no hair on here or very little hair but this is just basically.	O
If somebody wanted a quick reference as to how I draw female faces, this is what I would use.	O
The thing is, is everything over here is old?	CHITCHAT
This is the oldest.	O
This is newer and then this is.	CHITCHAT
This is the newer and then this is newest.	O
As I started getting better, my facial structure or the features in which I drew the faces started getting simpler.	O
You know these?	CHITCHAT
I don't necessarily draw my face is or draw them like this anymore.	O
It's still Silas still similar, but I would choose different stuff for the different hairstyles and things like that.	O
Plus now this is.	O
This was the extent.	O
Of my hair study from last year.	O
OK, this is literally all I ever Drew and this would be my references for the year when it was when it was about studying her.	O
This was it.	CHITCHAT
This is the 2020 her study.	O
Just as her study.	O
And this is just long hair.	O
Is literally six times bigger and this is just long hair.	O
This was my hair study, completely long, short bald.	O
This was it.	CHITCHAT
This is what I would reference in order to draw hair and to study here.	O
This is what I'm going to reference for the rest of 2020 and 2021 until I make it another one and then I will expand on this and it would just be infinitely expanding.	O
The better I get at doing whatever I do, the minute I feel like I'm better I I compare what I know to what I learned.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
And then I just share it.	O
It's the same thing with eyes and stuff like that like I have.	O

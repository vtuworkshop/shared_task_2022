This study right here, but I'm doing it.	O
I'm going to do a more detailed study on eyes.	O
I'm doing more in depth study and the whole in depth study is to be explained to is to help me explain in more detail how I do what I do, not how you do it in general, how I do it.	O
Because I can't explain you how you do it in general 'cause it's different for everybody.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Generalization in art is good and bad, you know.	O
So what I basically try to do?	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Is I simplify everything so like when I'm doing right now is like like this is this is where I'm at with like?	O
Head position studies where it's like I want to make it to where everything I do is.	O
Is broken down into a few keystrokes.	O
Like this it just a few keystrokes work.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm digital again.	CHITCHAT
This is all in the three and a half almost four years like process.	CHITCHAT
I've only been digitally drawing for four years digitally coloring digitally, anything for about four years.	CHITCHAT
Before that I did nothing digital.	CHITCHAT
It was all traditional.	CHITCHAT
I've swore away from digital.	CHITCHAT
Always like screw that digital is not for me.	CHITCHAT
Fun fact.	CHITCHAT
Well, when I used to stream on the Adobe channel before it became be hands.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Did not do digital.	CHITCHAT
I was 100% traditional on the Adobe channel which everybody was blown away by that because they used to always think that Adobe was about selling Adobe products and it was like no, they they told us that we are about art.	CHITCHAT
You know, do what you like to do and I was just like they're going to actually let me draw.	CHITCHAT
Traditional.	CHITCHAT
You know when this company is widely known for doing digital programming, I thought that was like the coolest move ever, you know now.	CHITCHAT
My friend to senseless was also a Behance streamer and you guys definitely should check her out.	CHITCHAT
She.	CHITCHAT
Saw that all the reason why wasn't drawing digital was because I didn't have a pencil.	CHITCHAT
You know, I love my pencil.	CHITCHAT
I use one pencil for.	O
The majority of my likable Art Karere.	O
My I still have my pencil.	CHITCHAT
My pencil is as old as my first born child.	CHITCHAT
My pencil is probably now about 25 years old.	CHITCHAT
It was.	CHITCHAT
It's the exact same at pencil.	CHITCHAT
I used one pencil, one brand of pencil and it was it was a graph gear.	CHITCHAT
Now my mind you that graph gear is the graph gear like pencil or whatever is just a pencil.	CHITCHAT
It just felt comfortable in my hands.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't the pencil did make me draw.	CHITCHAT
Better is just I was that type of person where it was like I was comfortable with my equipment.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to use that same equipment.	CHITCHAT
And I just didn't like changing and four.	CHITCHAT
And it was given to me by my best friend my best friend.	CHITCHAT
Bought it for me as a birthday present and I treasured it an I literally would not use another pencil.	CHITCHAT
That pencil cost me $60.00 when it first came out.	CHITCHAT
Now you can get it for six.	CHITCHAT
But that pencil.	CHITCHAT
Was very very very unique to me.	CHITCHAT
I've had a lot of stories based around that pencil.	CHITCHAT
I remember one time I like lossed it because.	CHITCHAT
My girlfriends friends came over, you know, and we're hanging out at my house and I just didn't like these these frames or or whatnot.	CHITCHAT
And then we come over and they would hang out at the house and one of them just decided to pick up my pencil and use it to write something and then keep it.	CHITCHAT
And if you're not an artist, you don't understand the significance of artists tools.	CHITCHAT
So I'm like.	CHITCHAT
There's no way like you, where is my pencil like?	CHITCHAT
I was losing it, you know, and she didn't know where it was.	CHITCHAT
And I'm like who was in my room.	CHITCHAT
This is that anyways.	CHITCHAT
Long story short, she calls her friends and ask her friends as anybody seen my pencil 'cause she just thinks it's a pencil.	CHITCHAT
I'm being freaking silly and I'm like dude.	CHITCHAT
Like I am about to lose it, so she calls her friends and you know, whenever friends like yeah I got I put it in my purse.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know I didn't really think nothing of it.	CHITCHAT
And I'm like you.	CHITCHAT
You took my pencil like why were you even at my desk?	CHITCHAT
Apparently she was showing them my artwork or whatever.	CHITCHAT
And you know, then I don't know whatever have transpired.	CHITCHAT
Is she basically the girl basically wrote down something for my girlfriend and then just like just unconsciously put the pencil in her purse?	CHITCHAT

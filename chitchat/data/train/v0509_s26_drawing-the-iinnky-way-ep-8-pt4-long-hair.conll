and I was like pretty my pencil right now, like right now, is this?	CHITCHAT
So it was like it was like.	CHITCHAT
It was probably like 910 at night.	CHITCHAT
So she had to drive all the way to the house there bring me back my pencil, and then from that point on I never left my pencil on my desk.	CHITCHAT
It was always somewhere hidden because I didn't trust my girlfriends, friends or my girlfriend to watch my stuff because she didn't care about art like I cared about it.	CHITCHAT
She just wasn't into it, you know?	CHITCHAT
So to anybody that's not into, it's something that I learned.	CHITCHAT
Growing up is that you will always understand that people don't care about things the same way you care about them.	CHITCHAT
If they don't share the same interest, you know.	CHITCHAT
So if you're an artist and there not an artist, they don't really care about art and they don't really care to hear about art and it.	CHITCHAT
It really, it really sucks when you try to get someone that you care about to be interested in something that you do and they just literally aren't interested in it.	CHITCHAT
It goes both ways.	CHITCHAT
Of course, you know 'cause 9 times outta 10 year your kids or your mate are going to be into something.	CHITCHAT
It just going to be like I don't care, I just don't care.	CHITCHAT
You know, even if you want to care, your brain is like I just don't care.	CHITCHAT
You know is like trying to get someone that's like into video games to care about karaoke.	CHITCHAT
They're going to just be like and less like karaoke.	CHITCHAT
Video games are just going to be like I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't care.	CHITCHAT
I actually don't care.	CHITCHAT
You know, I want to get back to doing my video games or with R just like I.	CHITCHAT
Really don't care how you made this Flam Bay.	CHITCHAT
I'm not into cooking, I'm into drawing.	CHITCHAT
I just really want to get back to my drawing.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's OK to be that way, but.	CHITCHAT
When it comes to equipment and stuff like that, someone.	CHITCHAT
If someone misplaces or uses something of yours and you like you always look at him like how are you?	CHITCHAT
How are you so in?	CHITCHAT
How are you like so insensitive?	CHITCHAT
Because they just just in their brain?	CHITCHAT
It's like it's just a pencil.	CHITCHAT
It's just this is just that you can get another one.	CHITCHAT
This like for artists like you bond with your equipment.	CHITCHAT
Like you get to a point where it's just like no.	CHITCHAT
This is not just a pencil, you know, you know.	CHITCHAT
I would always.	CHITCHAT
I would always tell Mikey is like this pencil.	CHITCHAT
Is like my.	CHITCHAT
This is like my soul mate this pencil understands me.	CHITCHAT
This pencil actually helps me make money.	CHITCHAT
This pencil goes along with everything that I want to do.	CHITCHAT
Never questions anything that I do like everything that I want to do.	CHITCHAT
Like this pencil is my soul mate.	CHITCHAT
You know, and it's basically paid his weight in gold.	CHITCHAT
You know it's like.	CHITCHAT
This pencil basically made it so that I could raise my children, you know and do all the things that I wanted to do and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's crazy to think about it, but now my best friend or my my friend to senseless.	CHITCHAT
She knew that I had.	CHITCHAT
She knew that I had a pencil.	CHITCHAT
That I thought about like that and that I didn't use any other tools, so she took it upon herself, which she didn't have too and made me.	CHITCHAT
The breast should I use?	CHITCHAT
And this brushes and irritable brush.	CHITCHAT
It works exactly like my graph gear 1000.	CHITCHAT
All I had to do was change the color.	CHITCHAT
That it it 'cause whenever when she gave it to me a Rd in.	CHITCHAT
It wrote in a graphite like Gray and I WS graffi.	CHITCHAT
I hate graphite.	CHITCHAT
I just can't stand graffi	CHITCHAT
It just makes my heart look boring.	CHITCHAT
And that's the only reason why I draw on blue.	CHITCHAT
I know there's reasons why people drawn blue, but the reason why I draw in blue is literally because I just don't like like it doesn't make my heart look interesting when I draw it any other way to me.	CHITCHAT
You know now.	CHITCHAT
Now ironically, I do change it to Gray after I draw it.	CHITCHAT
It's just fun for me to draw it in blue, and then I change it to that graphite grey afterwards.	CHITCHAT
So there's that, you know, there is that alright?	CHITCHAT
So you know, Yeah, but.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And then I started drawing on.	CHITCHAT
I started drawing digitally after I got this pencil.	CHITCHAT
Up until that point I only colored digitally.	CHITCHAT
I didn't, I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I would draw traditional scan it in.	CHITCHAT
And then ink over the top of it.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And then I decided I just wanted to draw and then once I started drawing, I stop drawing on paper.	CHITCHAT
I still drawn skin 'cause I'm going to tattoo artist.	CHITCHAT
So I mean, you know that's going to be forever, but it's a different type of media than just drawing on paper.	CHITCHAT
Their main reason why I started loving drawing digitally on paper.	CHITCHAT

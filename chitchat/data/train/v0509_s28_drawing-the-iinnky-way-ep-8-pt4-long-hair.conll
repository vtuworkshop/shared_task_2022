So what I did was I started constructing my entire layout as if I was drawing on paper.	O
Now granted, I've only been doing digital for four years.	CHITCHAT
Completely, that means I've only been drawing digitally digitally.	CHITCHAT
I've only been sketching and drawing digitally for two.	CHITCHAT
The first, the first couple of years I was just coloring.	CHITCHAT
I've only I've literally only been like drawing drawing like sketching and stuff like this.	CHITCHAT
For like 2 years, you know.	CHITCHAT
But now I've gotten infinitely better at drawing.	CHITCHAT
Even though.	CHITCHAT
The majority of it will.	CHITCHAT
The majority of what was learned while I was doing digital majority of my life I was spent drawing traditional.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't until I actually went digital that I my art expanded to the point where it was because I stopped caring.	CHITCHAT
About what I was doing.	CHITCHAT
Meaning I didn't.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't like I just didn't care about.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I just didn't care about making mistakes and I didn't care about checking I because I knew that if I really need to go back, I can go back, but why?	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
I used to do this thing when I was when I was drawing on the Adobe channel and I had this emote that was said, no eraser and my channel with spam, no eraser.	O
Whenever I picked up an eraser traditionally because I was training myself to stop thinking that everything I Drew was a mistake.	O
If it didn't look right, it didn't mean that it wasn't right.	O
So if they saw me using the eraser, which I pretty much never use the eraser, they would spam no eraser to remind me to put the eraser down if I was drawing, I would literally have to draw without erasing the entire image that I was drawing.	O
No matter if I actually did make a mistake or not I would have to find a way to fix it.	O
This helps me with tattooing.	O
Because if I ever make a mistake in tattooing with which you know what tattoo artist make mistakes right?	O
We don't.	CHITCHAT
We don't do that, you know.	O
But if we did which we don't.	O
But if we did.	CHITCHAT
Which we don't.	CHITCHAT
I would be able to correct it.	O
Now, of course I'm exaggerating.	CHITCHAT
We all make mistakes.	CHITCHAT
Tattoo artist make mistakes on every tattoo is just no one notices like that's the best.	O
The beautiful thing is you you get to the point where you're so good.	O
No one notices that you've made mistakes because the mistakes that were made aren't actually mistakes.	O
There's just things that you drew that you different let you change, or you drew differently because you did something that you weren't used to.	O
But now.	CHITCHAT
I decided to.	CHITCHAT
I decided that the thing that's most interesting to me.	O
Is is is.	CHITCHAT
Improving and cataloging that improvement in order to help future generations.	CHITCHAT
Just a little bit since I'm not the end all be all of Art, my my mentality is.	CHITCHAT
Well, maybe maybe, maybe I should.	CHITCHAT
Put out as much as I can.	CHITCHAT
To help those that wants to get better, at least have one more thing that they can look at.	CHITCHAT
Our one more person that they can reference or one more person that they can talk to about art.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
And help him improve.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of go from there.	CHITCHAT
So this right here this sheet right here is going to be the.	O
This is going to be the long hair test sheet for 2020.	O
The Next One I'm going to be doing is going to be short hair.	O
It shouldn't be as long.	O
It no pun intended.	CHITCHAT
It shouldn't be as long of a taxi.	O
But Because.	O
Short hair.	O
There's not very many.	CHITCHAT
Is not very many styles you can draw for short hair unless you just kind of push the envelope or whatnot.	O
So.	O
As far as that is concerned, I'm going to be.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start the short hair person portion.	O
This is going to be put in my discord.	CHITCHAT
If you guys haven't drawn, if you guys haven't already follow my discord, definitely get my discord to follow.	CHITCHAT
You know we're not doing that.	CHITCHAT
Nope, Nope, Nope, Nope.	CHITCHAT
Stop, stop, stop, stop.	CHITCHAT
What am I doing?	CHITCHAT
Go forward.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I just I end up moving something I wasn't supposed to be moving anyways.	CHITCHAT
So this is going to be in my discord for any of you guys that want to download.	CHITCHAT

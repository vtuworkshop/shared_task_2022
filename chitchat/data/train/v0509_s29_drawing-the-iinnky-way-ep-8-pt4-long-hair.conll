I don't know if I want to leave this here or there.	O
I'm trying to figure out the balance.	O
'cause I'm going to crop the end.	O
But the balances feels off.	O
I'm going to probably rearrange some stuff, but anyway I'm going to draw these short hair version.	O
Of.	O
This specific test sheet, and then what we're going to basically do is we're going to take the short hair version in a long haired version, and we're going to pick all the ones out of it that we like.	O
And then up on picking all the ones that we like.	O
We are going to.	CHITCHAT
I am actually going to explain how I draw her and use the all use all the ones that I like as examples of whatever you know for my book.	O
For those you guys they don't know I'm making a book and.	CHITCHAT
I will explain you the just of the book and then we will go ahead and call it for today.	CHITCHAT
Basically my channel.	CHITCHAT
In my in my in my.	CHITCHAT
In my studies as a streamer.	CHITCHAT
On multiple platforms, I understand that as an artist people will be asking you to draw things right, and it's frustrating when you're drawing something in the middle of it.	CHITCHAT
If someone will say, hey, can you draw this, you know?	CHITCHAT
And you're like, yeah, I could draw that are like no draw it right now are you know they want you to draw it right then?	CHITCHAT
Of course you don't want to stop and right right there you know.	CHITCHAT
Also you get asked to draw the same thing over and over.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if everybody.	CHITCHAT
Is like.	CHITCHAT
Experience to this, but I know I have been an I love my stream and I love my communities and I love a drawing things for people because they are watching me and they don't have to so how I rectified this situation was I decided that the best way to get people to stop asking you for stuff is to just draw it.	CHITCHAT
Which is why this whole drawing, the Inky, waving and everything came up.	CHITCHAT
Because people would ask me to draw all kinds of fan art and I mind you I don't like fan art.	CHITCHAT
I don't like to draw it like I don't.	CHITCHAT
I like to see it.	CHITCHAT
I just don't like to do it myself.	CHITCHAT
And the reason why I don't like to draw fan art is because I spent so many years drawing other peoples characters and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I just simply want to Draw Something of my own and be creative and spend my creative brain.	CHITCHAT
You can't really do that that Well.	CHITCHAT
You're to the extent that you want doing fan art so.	CHITCHAT
I don't really necessarily.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really to Fonda Fan Art, But.	CHITCHAT
Upon him helping people learn in the one thing you have to learn about people learning is the best way to get someone to learn is for them to want to learn from you.	CHITCHAT
You can't teach somebody that doesn't want to learn from you, you know yadda yadda yadda so.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
How the book came up was.	CHITCHAT
There is an influx of people that want to draw Waifus.	CHITCHAT
If you don't know what a wife who is is basically like an animated character, or you know, or a fictional character that people would normally see as a as wife material, you know.	CHITCHAT
And you see a lot of people draw them these days.	CHITCHAT
You know, like the anime character girls and stuff like that my community would ask me to draw them all the time knowing that I just don't want to draw them.	CHITCHAT
So with That being said.	CHITCHAT
I decided that well, I'm not going to get away from it, so I would draw them every now and again and it would just.	CHITCHAT
I realize I just don't like drawing them, but I'm really good at drawing them.	CHITCHAT
So I decided that I what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a book and this book is going to be.	CHITCHAT
Everything that I know about drawing it, you know.	CHITCHAT
Sexy females or just female anatomy and however you want to choose to use it?	CHITCHAT
I didn't want to make it a giant book of hey I drew a bunch of girls look at this I wanted people I wanted it to be something where.	CHITCHAT
It would, it would.	CHITCHAT
It would ultimately.	CHITCHAT
Keep me from having to draw.	CHITCHAT
Sexy females because I don't necessarily enjoy drawing them all that much just simply because I just draw them too much.	CHITCHAT
It's not that I don't like it, it's just like straw.	CHITCHAT
Too much whenever you draw anything too much, you just don't want to draw it anymore.	CHITCHAT
and I am really comfortable with the way I draw females at a point where I don't necessarily want to draw them everyday, I want to learn something new that makes me feel uncomfortable and I can get better, you know?	CHITCHAT
So I want to draw monsters and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
You know, alien spaceships all kinds of different things.	CHITCHAT
And not have to consistently draw sexy women.	CHITCHAT
So the book that I'm making is basically dumping all of my knowledge about drawing women sexy and non sexy or whatever, and hopefully explaining it in a way that people can understand it, you know.	CHITCHAT
And this is a part of that.	CHITCHAT

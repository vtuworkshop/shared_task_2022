This is the hair part.	O
So basically I'm just I didn't have any hair studies other than the one I showed you guys before, so I'm making I'm making like I'm trying to make as much information and explain it in a way that I know I haven't seen in a book before, which is the hard part.	O
What I decided I was going to do for the book is to stop explaining the how everyone explains the how in art books.	CHITCHAT
How to do this, how to do that.	CHITCHAT
No one explains why they do it or why you should do it, or why it's a good reason to do it this way, or why you think why.	CHITCHAT
And that's kind of what I'm getting at.	CHITCHAT
Is what I'm trying to explain, why you know?	CHITCHAT
Or trying to get people to understand why and get their brain to understand why 'cause it makes it easier for you to learn when you know why.	CHITCHAT
Which is why I'm doing the book, you know, and then I won't have to draw females anymore on stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm never going to stop drawing the things that I draw, just some things I just don't want to draw on stream.	CHITCHAT
and I think people will accept it a lot more.	CHITCHAT
When you have this giant catalog of things that they already want to see, so if they're like, Hey, can you draw me this Marvel superhero?	CHITCHAT
I've already drawn it.	CHITCHAT
I already made it really look look really nice, and here is.	CHITCHAT
Proof and then they usually like Oh you did it already cool?	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause a lot of times most people just want to see if you can draw it or want to see what it would look like if you drew it.	CHITCHAT
And that's the fun part about art.	CHITCHAT
I started this thing called the 100.	CHITCHAT
Which is basically 100 superheroes and villains.	CHITCHAT
This has been the most ambitious project I've done on.	CHITCHAT
Any social media when I start it and This is why this is how I learned how to do digital and this is like 50%.	CHITCHAT
Of these characters is 100 of these, and they're done.	CHITCHAT
I made these poster size pictures that I made them super detail and you can find them in my discord link is in the bottom of the channel, or off to the right of the channel.	CHITCHAT
But I did these so that each and everyone of these characters I would never have to draw again because I just refer to the 100.	CHITCHAT
You know, an there now.	CHITCHAT
The other thing that's cool is like you can actually look and see how my anatomy has changed the further you go down, you know.	CHITCHAT
100 and then you will see also how I have changed the way that I Drew.	CHITCHAT
And in the way that I would do digital and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Now I mind you these beginning ones.	CHITCHAT
Of the 100, have the test sheets in the background.	CHITCHAT
These are traditionally drawn test season traditionally drawn characters that were scanned in an then colored over the top.	CHITCHAT
I don't do my tests like that anymore and my tests look like this now.	CHITCHAT
My testes now look like.	CHITCHAT
Where is my where is my favorite one?	CHITCHAT
Let me find my favorite one.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
This is now my testes look like.	CHITCHAT
It basically has the image off to the side and then a more in depth.	CHITCHAT
Look at how I even 'cause the testes were designed to show people how what I did to figure out how to draw that character.	CHITCHAT
Now I go a little bit more in detail where.	CHITCHAT
If I'm drawing, say, Red Sonja.	CHITCHAT
I already know people are going to ask me to draw this character or characters like this, so my goal is to not have to draw it anymore by giving them the basis to draw it themselves.	CHITCHAT
You know again, the best way to get someone to not ask you to Draw Something is to draw it, but you don't just draw it, you draw it in such a way and you do it in such a way that it almost forces them to do it themselves or forces them to be a better artist.	CHITCHAT
Or to try it themselves, or to make them pick up their pencils and draw.	CHITCHAT
Which is my ultimate goal in the first place.	CHITCHAT
If they get you to pick up your pencil and draw, that's it.	CHITCHAT
Don't care if you're practicing or making art, as long as you draw every day is a step toward you know becoming a better artist and not quitting art.	CHITCHAT
The less you pick your pencil up, the more likely you're probably going to either not get better or not want to do anymore.	CHITCHAT
And that's what I want to avoid.	CHITCHAT
Is people quitting art and stuff like that?	CHITCHAT
Because there are there are too few artists in the world you know, and people don't necessarily understand the importance of art.	CHITCHAT
'cause you know they just don't think that art is a thing, you know.	CHITCHAT
So my goal is to get everyone to see the artist decided themselves you know and something like this say you're a fan of red Sonja and you get ahold of this like this not only helps you draw a red Sonja, but now it helps you draw any warrior woman you know.	CHITCHAT
A little bit better.	CHITCHAT

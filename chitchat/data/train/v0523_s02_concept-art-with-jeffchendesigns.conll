Like teal maybe.	O
So in that stands out a bit more from the rest of this, yeah.	O
Hell yeah before I want like a second area to match this as well.	O
But before that I might just place.	O
A little bit of silver here.	O
To make that whole thing popping up.	O
Oh hey, Grut Yeah man, this is a good place to talk if you want.	O
I've been on so I don't know if you can.	O
He been on while I've been off, but.	O
Yeah, if you have any questions about.	O
The op journey and all that ask it here.	O
I'd be really happy to talk about it here.	O
But yeah, seeing some of your past work would be really helpful for the questions you were asking.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
What is it like 3 days ago?	CHITCHAT
OK, yes I wanted this to be a bit brighter, normal italic.	O
OK yeah, the cloth here should make that Green as well, let's see.	O
And what are you up to, Lee?	CHITCHAT
How's that rap coming along?	CHITCHAT
I can hear his New Zealand accent.	CHITCHAT
Wait, wait, I said it was you.	CHITCHAT
Should that be green?	CHITCHAT
Should I make that green?	O
Was a weird.	CHITCHAT
Should this be white?	O
Going into desaturate.	O
It just white for that.	O
Think that feels better.	O
But I will make the top one little bit funky color.	O
Let's up the.	O
Up all these maybe not brightness.	O
And four Jesus is pretty funky.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Now, is this reduce our should huge jitter?	O
Yeah, here we go.	CHITCHAT
Stay in the same Hue.	O
Hacks bro.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
If you guys wondering what I use there, it's.	O
Brush settings going to color dynamics tennis on.	O
And post the Hue saturation and brightness jitter.	O
If you understand what these means and you basically understand what this does, if I turn that huge it away up, we're going to see a bunch of different colors pop up.	O
See, but if you want to really know what colors that we want this to be, then keep that Hugh relatively low.	O
And you should be good.	CHITCHAT
I like to use it with a brick type of brush.	O
Everyone's doing a rap bro.	O
Until I call you bro, I never say bro.	O
Stuff I mostly worry about is what to practice first, not withdrawing people or characters in general.	O
I think I mentioned that I want to illustrate my stories eventually.	O
OK, yeah, I think like Oh yeah I remember now.	CHITCHAT

Yeah so it sounded like you act like the very early beginning stages of art and.	O
To be honest, anything that you draw is really going to help you for this is my opinion.	O
It's just you get so much mileage out of just drawing, so you know copying artwork that you like right now and understanding how that like what they do is already going to be very beneficial for you and also you have to copy things.	O
That's one way of doing things.	O
You could also.	O
Practice doing your versions of some current existing art as well.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
What I mean by that is like it's basically using reference, so you have your reference and you change up some stuff to make it noticeably different, but you heavily rely on that reference to help you create that outlook.	O
Studies yesterday useful.	O
I think the issue with that is that's slowing down the mileage that I'm talking about.	O
At least I find out for me like that's not something that everyone deals with, but study is is pretty boring and he is an I think this starting stages of art should be very fun.	O
Because, you know, it's a brand new skill that you're learning.	O
You should be interesting in just trying it.	O
And like you know, drawing different styles and copying those different styles.	O
And even if you draw bad, it's OK because you just started so.	O
Yeah, if you focus on that mileage then you should be all good.	O
So basically to ask your question, what should you practice?	O
When you want to draw people and characters is to draw people in characters, copy them for now and then, yeah, that's what I would do.	O
You know there's all the other resources that are free right now.	CHITCHAT
Like drop box.	CHITCHAT
A bunch of YouTube videos you can watch how people will go through the process of that.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, there's a few things you want to think about as well while you copy.	O
And while you learn and.	O
You just want to notice like certain proportions and all that like.	O
There's a lot of resources out there talking about like how many, how to measure proportions in a character, for example.	O
So you can use like the head as your measurement tool, and the body can be split into different numbers of heads with width and the height.	O
So once you learn things like that, you'll be aware of it when you start copying other artwork, you'll think of it as well.	O
And then eventually, once you've drawn enough, once you've copied enough, you'll start to.	O
Remember.	CHITCHAT
What it's like to draw characters in certain proportions so you don't have to rely heavily on that reference.	O
Now, by the way, like when I say copy doesn't mean you copy it and then like you posted online over saying that you did it yourself, that's definitely not what you want to do.	O
You just copy it for your own sake.	O
You're drawing for your own sake.	O
You don't have to like post it anywhere.	O
Low commitment.	O
Just just there for you.	CHITCHAT
You know self learning.	O
Guidance as good as it is I think you know paying for it at the moment, I don't think it's too necessary because this is so many free resources right now.	O
So yeah, and all those videos is resources can help you give you ideas what you should do.	O
For mileage.	O
Yeah, like even if you if you like what I'm drawing, you just want to copy the head or something easy.	O

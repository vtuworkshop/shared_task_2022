Copy it, you'll see like how I simplify certain things, certain features and things.	O
Honest, complicated as it looks when you break it down to each tiny section.	O
There's a lot of times you can, you know.	CHITCHAT
Start to learn.	CHITCHAT
As well, they always ask questions.	CHITCHAT
In discord, the cycle path says.	O
OK, we've got our flats down now.	O
We can start to add some shadow.	O
Oh yeah, one more thing.	CHITCHAT
You should probably learn if you want to do digital art in particular is get get to understand what we talk about in.	O
The tool by using photo shop, so understand what it means.	O
When I open like new layers, clipping masks.	O
Yeah, I think I'll just list some essential things that you should probably learn about so there's layers clipping mask up, masking.	O
In general adjustment layers, and the different options you can pick in here.	O
I mostly use Hue, saturation, color, balance levels, curves, an gradient Maps, or yeah, gradients brush brush settings.	O
I think all these are pretty important.	O
And you'll selection types will be useful.	O
Keep it simple at slot yet, so I think all you really need is.	O
Your brush and your layers I think.	O
Those are the main things you should probably learn about.	O
You don't have to go crazy.	O
You have to get like a crazy brush like I don't know whatever this one is, you don't.	O
You don't need that, just your simple round brush does a lot, but make sure you understand things in your brush settings.	O
'cause that's pretty important.	O
You definitely want to have at least transfer on with pen pressure.	O
And yet hit me up with any questions during the stream.	CHITCHAT
If you have any pop up ads, you try some stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'll be happy to help.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, that's from colors down, huh?	O
Other colors, let's get some lighting down.	O
This is where things start to go.	O
Pop pop man.	O
This is multiply.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Will go cool shadows.	O
And if anyone else has questions about art stuff.	CHITCHAT
So let me know.	CHITCHAT
Hit me up.	CHITCHAT
This is definitely what I'm doing now for these fish.	O
My practice to digital, and I'm currently on iPad drawing on Glass kind of throws me off, so I figure I should get over that quickly with this.	O
Hell yeah, that's the right way to think.	O
Understand what medium you want to work with early and practice that.	O
I don't think that I don't know.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of mixed information on this, but I'm you know, I'm very certain, for me at least, that understanding my medium helped me greatly and I don't even really work in digital at all, so I don't touch digital.	O
And that hasn't affected me in anyway, but.	O
Well, I say that after I've had like a lot of experience with traditional as a kid, so maybe there are some advantages to early learning with your traditional medium.	O
Maybe it's faster, maybe it builds confidence, so if you, if you find tutorials that say you should probably do this in traditional.	O
Then maybe you should do it in traditional, like I think there are some exercises in drop box that's about building confidence and and steady line work and those might be pretty essential to do in traditional.	O
But yeah, getting used to getting used to drawing on the iPad isn't a bad thing and iPads a great tool for art.	O
I think it might be a bit slower for me, but it's definitely doable if I want to make it like.	O
You know my work working.	O
Medium Hard rough so faithful hard round buddy.	O
That's the brush you need.	O

Something I've noticed a lot.	O
See, I'm like Falvey covering up certain areas with shadow.	O
I think people don't control their lighting well enough like this.	O
I think if it was done by.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Some newbie artists they would like.	O
Add shadows across.	O
The edge is only.	O
And then everything ends up looking flat.	O
Something like this like they see every component.	O
And they saw satellite it like this edge edge edge edge.	O
Because the lights coming from the top right, top, left right so I gotta Add all these edge shadows.	O
But then there are whole forms that like will not be facing the light source.	O
Areas like in here it's just being covered by this whole edge here, so if you want things to feel more 3D, you have to understand.	O
You'll forms an your lighting an some big booty like bold moves like this is necessary.	O
Don't just shadow along the edges like this, that's bad.	O
And the way to understand how to get to this stage is too.	O
You know, create a sphere might be useful.	O
I'll do it now even.	O
Is it so quick?	CHITCHAT
So I'll do a sphere that's in the same light source as.	O
As a as a man.	CHITCHAT
I'll dude.	CHITCHAT
Wait, what we're doing?	CHITCHAT
And you notice like to make this feel spherical, there's going to be a lot of.	O
Area that's covered in shadow.	O
So that's going to be same as algi, right light from the top left shadow on this side.	O
This whole areas of discover his shadow.	O
So if you think about this in a 3D form.	O
Let's relate it to like this shoulder armor.	O
I want it to be round right the way I've drawn it.	O
So if it is round, there's going to be areas that are heavily covered in shadow an we have to determine if it's which edge on the sphere is corresponding to.	O
The plane of the object where trying to light and if that areas in shadow then that means we should be.	O
Putting all that in Shadow, and in this case I think I should have a little bit more, so I'm just going to push that across a little bit with the gradient.	O
And yet, like see how this is like.	O
I'm imagining this has like curvature on this, right?	O
It's like this round, so if it comes around like this will be similar to like this area of a sphere so.	O
This should all be Leslie Shadow.	O
I'm going to use a hot air brush do this.	O
I'm just going to.	O
Get back to softening.	O
Some of the shadows later.	O
This is the same layer.	O
do I have the right color picked?	O
I do?N't.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so this will help us think about forms a lot better.	O
Keep that in mind.	O
Yeah, so again, no edge shadows.	O
Thinking big chunks.	O
And use that sphere.	O
I love you 3000 thanks Ann Lamb.	O
Pichu, I love how you explain things.	CHITCHAT
I love explaining things as well.	CHITCHAT
'cause I I'll bring classes right?	CHITCHAT
So I run I see like issues that people run into pretty often and you know, I don't want to like people posted in discord.	CHITCHAT
and I notice issues.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to like.	CHITCHAT
Point them out if they ask for critiques.	CHITCHAT
But these common type of issues, I think it's good about.	CHITCHAT
It's good to talk about in here.	CHITCHAT
And if you run into any type of issues that you want to resolve, just let me know.	CHITCHAT
I'm really happy to talk about it here.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to help.	CHITCHAT
And just because we're going into shadow in certain areas, like in here doesn't mean we have to stay in their right.	O
Maybe some of the edges on here pop out far enough to receive some light, for example this edge.	O
It's facing upwards according to our sphere.	O
Things that are facing upwards can receive light.	O
So if that's facing up enough and it is protruding outwards enough, then we can get some light hitting here.	O
See that.	CHITCHAT
So just that little change can do quite a lot.	O

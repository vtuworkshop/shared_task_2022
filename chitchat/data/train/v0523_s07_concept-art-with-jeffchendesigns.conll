We've we're telling, telling people that this little object pops out a little bit.	O
That is, changing the angle of the form.	O
That's what is very important about lighting.	O
The moth of constructive criticism.	O
Wow, that's that's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
And yet, the more accurately you set yourself up in this stage, the better.	O
I think you don't want to like brush past this stage too quickly in.	O
Jump into quick rendering.	O
If you take a time here, then that quick rendering later will be much much easier.	O
Pop up with my explanations.	O
Hell yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I love doing the render stage like for me it's like.	O
There's not too much thinking after.	O
Do anyone, sort of?	CHITCHAT
Second nature.	CHITCHAT
And there's also so much to talk about because it's bringing in a lot of fundamentals together when you get to this stage.	O
When I was doing the line work before windows, like just at this stage here it looks cool, but there really isn't much to talk about.	O
An yeah, I think maybe I'll just go through the other characters and through the line work.	O
Separately outside of stream and then come back to you like rendering.	O
For the stream.	CHITCHAT
So we have more to talk about.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, love rendering.	CHITCHAT
Before when I was just learning, I remember I struggled a lot with rendering and I would.	CHITCHAT
Have to think a lot about it and it was less fun like I'd be rushing to finish my artwork.	CHITCHAT
But these days, when I'm understanding there's so much more depth to it.	CHITCHAT
So much information you have to add.	CHITCHAT
And I have to think less about things that had trouble with before.	CHITCHAT
I can enjoy it to the fullest.	CHITCHAT
Take my time.	CHITCHAT
At detail.	CHITCHAT
One more thing I didn't mention about this fear is that sometimes you have to imagine there's two spheres here.	O
Like imagine there's one more sphere on the right of this.	O
And if there's light coming down from the left side, then this fear will be costing Shadow on the sphere on the right.	O
So this is the case here.	O
We have like a big shoulder armor here that's costing shadow onto this neck area and will most likely cast shadow onto part of.	O
This headpiece Probably come all the way around here to be honest, that car shadow.	O
Hell yeah.	CHITCHAT
How long you been drawing this ohm?	O
So I've been going through, let me find some files real quick.	O
So here are the sketches of all the characters I think I spent around.	O
Three sessions getting.	CHITCHAT
I took like 2 so yeah, each stream is like 2 hours.	CHITCHAT
I could get 2 characters done per stream, 2 characters, sketches done per stream.	O
So I'd say one hour this is.	CHITCHAT
Probably like the.	CHITCHAT
2 hour Mark.	CHITCHAT
I think right now.	CHITCHAT
When you want to work with lines, I think you get a lot of accuracy, but it can slow you down as well.	O

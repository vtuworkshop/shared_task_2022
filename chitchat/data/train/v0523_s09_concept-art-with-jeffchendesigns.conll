It's a little fun community.	CHITCHAT
We can share your outlook.	CHITCHAT
Get to know some other artists from around the world.	CHITCHAT
We do challenges as well.	CHITCHAT
In fact, about finishing up one of our challenges where we're doing a telephone game.	CHITCHAT
And I can show you that's what we did before actually so my local files, so that's easy to access.	CHITCHAT
But I can't click my.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think my windows is dead.	CHITCHAT
I thought it can click like my folder thing.	CHITCHAT
Now here we go back.	O
Let me grab that.	CHITCHAT
Stuff.	CHITCHAT
Mikes dropping?	CHITCHAT
Up here we go challenge.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Last time you did the telephone game, basically what the telephone game game is we have.	CHITCHAT
Someone who passes an artwork.	CHITCHAT
Two and it goes in like sort of a chain right?	CHITCHAT
So it started off with me.	O
I had full groups of people that did that did this.	O
This is the outlook that it started off with.	O
And basically you pass it down to the next person.	O
So example case parts for my art and did her version of the piece I did and then she passes on her artwork to the next person.	O
And then that person only sees case be arts work and doesn't see mine.	O
And does her interpretation of case, vearth, artwork and so on.	O
So you end up with a variation of like an evolution of original artwork.	O
I mean like you come back and look at the end and see how it changed rap.	O
Very close to the reveal stage for the current challenge which is very exciting.	O
So yeah, it's very fun.	CHITCHAT
Last time this is the kind of stuff we do on on my discord.	O
For anyone interested.	CHITCHAT
I have a link in this stream description, I think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it's down there.	CHITCHAT
Moscow, California hell yeah.	CHITCHAT
I don't have anyone who's rushing in the discord, actually.	CHITCHAT
I can't recall.	CHITCHAT
Maybe there are and they're not active.	CHITCHAT
For now I'm curious about my time zone.	CHITCHAT
I'm in Sydney, 7:45 AM up nice and early for the stream.	CHITCHAT
Main reason I'm up so early is 'cause I have better Internet during this time so.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise, I probably stream at like lunchtime.	CHITCHAT
If I could I would be ideal for me.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to do like a.	O
'cause this side of the shield is sort of around here on this fear, and that area is a bit ambiguous.	O
It's like between light and shadow is kind of Softap.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to add like a slight gradient on here, same as like the leg and foot here.	O
And we pretty much very close to finishing off the lighting on this guy.	O
Our initial lighting.	O
Just a few more spots to keep consistent like this thing.	CHITCHAT
Telegram is more popular.	CHITCHAT
What's telegram?	CHITCHAT
Tell me about it.	CHITCHAT
Get some more juicy information of sharing a second after I.	O

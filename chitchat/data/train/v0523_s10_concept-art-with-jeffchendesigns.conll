Finish up just a few more small areas of shadow.	O
I think this would get some cost shadow from this shoulder pad eventually.	O
Yeah, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Alrighty, let's talk about edges, huh?	O
Hard edges verse, soft edges.	O
When should you transition from?	O
When should like lighting transition and become soft edges instead of hard edges?	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
Like that should cover up.	O
This is very important because this is telling us what is a car shadow, what is form Shadow and understanding.	O
The difference is very useful in representing.	O
Clear forms in your characters or whatever you're drawing.	O
Actually, that's not bad.	O
Actually offers people a few more spots too.	O
To come rub.	O
I missed the hand completely.	O
And then I'll come back to that talk about hard versus soft edges.	O
OK, so as I was saying.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, what about will just go ahead?	O
Hard versus soft edges.	O
When should you use them?	O
So let's use.	CHITCHAT
This is the leg as an example.	O
I think we have a great example around here.	O
This like.	O
We have a cloth that's costing Shadow on this leg.	O
And we have areas of form right?	O
The legs around.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
How do we represent that?	O
This is a cast Shadow and this isn't a cast shadow.	O
This is just a form that's turning away from the light source.	O
So that's what the whenever.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
You should definitely use a softap brush notice off brush off brush will work or smudging, and you only have like a blended edge.	O
And this is the difference right when it's a blended edge that's telling us that this is a form that's turning away from Light, 'cause That's a slow transition.	O
That's why I said nice zsoft edge on that.	O
We can leave this as a hard edge because.	O
There's no transition like that for car shadowcon shadow suggest areas that are blocked by another object.	O
Blocking light.	O
From having their light blocked by another object, so that's why it stays a hard edge so.	O
And she turned your.	O
If you turn your car shadows into soft edge.	O
It doesn't really make sense, and then everything will look very blurry and.	O
A bit ambiguous, so definitely keep those edges hard and I'm just going through a lot of edges in here and determining whether their soft and hard edges according to.	O
Then being cast shadow or form shadow.	O
He's a big form shadow here.	O
Cloth is a good one for hard and soft edges.	O
'cause it's only transitions in there.	O
And you'll see that this will look quite different after I do this merging.	O

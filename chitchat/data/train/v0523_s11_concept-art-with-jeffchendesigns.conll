Hell yeah OK we're getting there.	CHITCHAT
And we could sort of still edit out light eye shadow color, which is really fun.	O
Like a little bit more purple instead of blue 'cause I didn't want to make it slightly warmer.	O
Think blue is a bit too cool.	O
And we can always turn down the Opacity as well, so it's not so aggressive.	O
I think I started off with a darker, darker value so I can build up from here.	O
That was my initial plan.	O
Grab that shadow color.	O
Apply it to more areas, whoops, wrong mode.	O
OK, one more area needed to change.	O
Colours I think we need to sort of represent that this is a soft material here, so I just make that.	O
Which I do.	CHITCHAT
I think I should.	O
Probably keep this upper arm light and turn these things.	O
Dog.	CHITCHAT
Alright, another ultimate question for you guys.	CHITCHAT
Do you prefer painted artwork that painted Ross?	CHITCHAT
Painterly look Or do you like line art?	CHITCHAT
No judgment, but definitely adored.	CHITCHAT
I question.	CHITCHAT
That's better.	CHITCHAT
Right, let's add some lighting as well.	O
I prefer a rough painted stuff, I think, but it's painted wrong comparison.	O
I love both bathrooms painted ones.	O
Also put in a paint.	O
Yeah, there's something feeling about the Painted Looker.	O
And for anyone wondering what I'm doing right now, I'm using a colored Dodge mode.	O
I've turned off some options in here, so these used to be ticked.	O
I turn those off for my color Dodge and I'm just going with some lighting and defining some of these.	O
Materials.	O
So materials You could, like you know, slap on a texture.	O
That's photo, but I really don't think she do that thing.	O
Materials are represented by different value ranges.	O
So that's what I'm doing right now, and everything that sort of.	O
Using the same range of values, right?	O
I had the flats and then I add a shadow on top, but we start introduce a different range for value range for certain material.	O
You start to understand that it has different information from.	O
Some of the other materials.	O
And that's what's happening here.	O
Very easy clap.	CHITCHAT

The transition area, so I'm just going to pick.	O
That a warmth.	O
And that overlay.	O
In some of these transition areas.	O
That's going from light to shadow.	O
I think that was a bit too red orangey.	O
See how this looks.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, might be better.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to pick on those areas that a bit softer edged.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Can I have it?	CHITCHAT
The more blood on this guys tones as well.	O
That's something else does pretty well.	O
OK, and I might also.	CHITCHAT
Where is it?	CHITCHAT
Or looks kinda cool when it's like.	O
Doc metal Actually I do.	O
I do wonder now.	O
What happens if I like huge shift a little bit and look through?	O
It's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
My dear is that.	CHITCHAT
Will have similar materials by different color for each of these Warriors, so we definitely will run into some that have like detailing like this guy, but then it has like different color detailing instead.	O
Green's kind of cool though.	O
But we'll go with yellow.	O
Was it I want to select these things and add lighting on that as well?	O
A less aggressive light, maybe something.	O
With lower opacity.	O
I'll feel.	CHITCHAT
Nice.	CHITCHAT
And since I did everything like separate laid like this is so easy to select stuff right?	O
Like if I wanted to select those markings again, you know I just hold CTRL, Press the layer and get all the selection for that if I want like the light toned arma I can select that.	O
Phone select the Brown bits.	O
Then I thought of here the whole silhouette and start he raising areas that I don't want selections off with arm by holding alt.	O
And control.	O
So now I can easily affect all the Brown areas.	O
That's the power of setting things up nice and clean and right now that's relevant because I want to add a second very light.	O
And secondary lights only appear in shadowed areas.	O
So what that means is I can select my shadowed areas now.	O
And adding a softap.	O
The flight maybe with like a blue.	O
Getting that secondary light.	O
Easy see now just affecting.	O
Wait, not that do work, I didn't.	O
Using the selection.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Now I can just affect all the areas of shadow.	O
With my secondary light and secondary lighter mainly thinking about it coming from the top down.	O
So any services that are facing upwards.	O
And apply that.	O
And this is how we show some more format information in those shadowed areas.	O

Oh yeah, I fell asleep yesterday.	CHITCHAT
I was so tired I just could not.	CHITCHAT
I know it was before nine was bad, but now I'm like fully energize.	CHITCHAT
I had a bunch of other things I wanted to say.	CHITCHAT
Now it's all set my mind.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it was Kate.	CHITCHAT
It's Katie and a Jasper face.	CHITCHAT
Today's Happy Birthday.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if they turn into my streams.	CHITCHAT
Weird, that sort of a side note story.	CHITCHAT
He's actually friends with somebody using discovered me Ray Charles single chat through these being at Bloodstreams so we didn't know each other.	CHITCHAT
But then we will find out we had a mutual friend and she found me on here.	CHITCHAT
So that was pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
So today.	CHITCHAT
Let's add more space man.	O
Go into detail.	O
Sad with this guy.	O
Steven is saying This is literally the first year I've heard of Juneteenth has been around for awhile.	O
I don't know how, uh.	O
Is it really that it's in the spotlight?	O
Um, obviously.	CHITCHAT
Now everything going on in the world sort of taking center stage so plays an important holiday.	O
So that'll spaceman Ann, I know.	O
Last time we decided to add a whole bunch of super fun stuff to our spaceman illustrations was getting like really crazy.	O
'cause the other the dogs were not this detailed.	O
I don't think that she will change those details so, but I decided to sketch out this trying to figure out.	O
The he needs to be tethered to something, so I have this plan to have this kind of sad that comes through.	O
In this hand and then over here, he's gonna be holding a wrench.	O
Fresh cakes here.	CHITCHAT
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
Fresh cake fresh case in the stream are not streaming this weekend.	CHITCHAT
What are you doing here?	CHITCHAT
Go party, go eat your cake, why?	CHITCHAT
Hey, I would be.	CHITCHAT
So happy Father's Day to fresh cake and well, uhm, so yeah, we're working on spaceman, we've got.	CHITCHAT
We've got this kind of sketched out the International Space Station, 'cause I think that's where I want him to be.	O
Tethered not 100% sure if you guys have any other suggestions.	O
What about having a little like space pod like that comes out like spaceship when there in space they have like little recycling triangle in right?	O
But, uh, I used.	CHITCHAT
I had wanted to do the International Space Station for whatever reason, will probably not going to make it very detailed, but I did put a sketch in here.	O
Let me know if you like the idea of the ISS and sides are kind of coming off.	O
I like the composition that it makes.	O
It makes like fur more balanced.	O
Composition I think, and I kind of like the idea of the tether coming off and then coming back up at the bottom of the screen.	O
So that's what I have kind of laid out.	O
The other thing we need to make sure we add is like I said, the wrench in this hand and then we were going to add jetpacks.	O
I think that's funny thing you've already got straps on him, so we're going to add some fire to this because I said so first cake.	O
Say I'm good.	CHITCHAT
No strings weekend passing through being as well, it's it around.	CHITCHAT
Well, you sit around and sit around and take the evening or day weekend off.	CHITCHAT
So what do you think?	CHITCHAT
The other thing we need?	O
You guys help with is figuring out what we want to put on him.	O
Like someone add some patches or something like I don't.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Space suits usually eyepatches although the SpaceX ones like we kind of looked at it so that my reference if you have space exercise those basics.	O
People don't really have any patches so maybe maybe not.	O
But if you think.	CHITCHAT
You guys think of something like something fun we put on them?	O
Because normally space space, not space suits look like NASCAR like cars that got patches all over himself.	O
Anyways, I'm gonna get into.	O
Probably jetpacks first, unless you think I should.	O
You guys, let me know.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start there.	O
You want to see me start working on some of the shapes of the International Space Station?	O
I can do that as well, but I kind of want to just.	O
Finish him off for the most part and then we want to do that again.	O
I'm not poppy patches nixas puppy patches.	O
I mean that's I'm all about that life.	O
So I'm actually probably going to do these off to the side and then kind of tilt them in, line them up so they're like.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Cylinder shapes right?	O
Fresh cakes, I think that you could use import or something.	O
Yeah ports or something to connect hoses too.	O
Yeah, we gotta attach this tether tethered or something so.	O
Could definitely add some like monkeys chords.	O
Part of it as well see so.	O

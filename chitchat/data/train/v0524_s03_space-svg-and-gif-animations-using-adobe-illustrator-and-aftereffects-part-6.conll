I don't know that I want that strong of a shadow on it.	O
Fresh, fresh tasting will have another slice of cake right now.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't blame you.	CHITCHAT
So going to Katie.	CHITCHAT
It's like well, I don't know what kind of cake.	CHITCHAT
You was like it looks like maybe like Maple and like something should I don't know it was really good.	CHITCHAT
No, and I want it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not gonna put like 100 details into this.	O
Probably not making any detail into the canister because we're going to put it behind everything.	O
Look at hey how are you?	CHITCHAT
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
You are just joining your working on this little space spaceman illustration of that I'm working on.	O
I guess I could pull up the previous ones that we had fun.	O
See if I can.	CHITCHAT
My my my known all this I'm going to show you guys the other animations work done so you guys can see sort of where we.	O
It's like my finer every time I open the Finder window, it like puts it in the same spot.	O
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
Calculation, so we've been doing.	O
Butter cream man not hungry.	CHITCHAT
OK, going to eat cake now.	CHITCHAT
Jack you made me hungry later everybody will thanks for joining appreciate having you checking out the stream.	CHITCHAT
So uh, Lucas says I'm fine thanks, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
And Daniel says hello hello everybody hello.	CHITCHAT
Hello all, I'm saying hello to everybody so we worked on the the first when we started this consolation one.	CHITCHAT
Uh, we pull up.	CHITCHAT
So we made up.	CHITCHAT
Always something comes up there.	CHITCHAT
We made this week in.	O
We did two things we exported out.	O
SVG from illustrator an.	O
We imported the AI file in your after effects from the animated them.	O
So just 'cause I that's.	O
I think SVG Animations and I also just need to get some more practice, not perfect, so that would be kind of fun to show two different processes and you can make obviously from after effects using export for a number of tons of different formats with media encoder.	O
But I like making SVG's using the web, so just kind of one thing.	O
Let me show you this person we did constellation and they just kind of rotate.	O
These are just the constellations that are visible in the Northern Hemisphere rotating around.	O
The past we automate this space as PG and open that up so you can see that we did basically the same animation.	O
Just use two different methods.	O
I'm going to do the same thing with the Ryan we're going to.	O
I'm kind of thinking about all the things I want to have animate in the scenes IO straight it and whether or not that's feasible and how I could do that in both SVG air.	O
In after effects and when I say SVG, I mean we're writing the CSS S by hand.	O
Open source code error called Adam.	O
This values I like using Atom because there's a add on for Adam let's You Preview SVG Animations.	O
So I know it's a lot of technical information will probably not going to get into it, you know?	O
I just moved over there.	O
Probably not going to get into it today.	O
Certainly the animation part of it, but you gotta Lotta illustrating with you when I'm talking way too much, but we also did some of the audios.	O
So dollars here.	O
Season daughters and we did.	O
This is how similar to how we're going to do the Orion Animation, where we have the consolation kind of like popular on and he has some kind of secondary motion with the dogs here.	O
The tails obviously there's a lot more going on with Brian, so this is Canis Major and famous minor.	O
There's a lot more going on, more moving parts, so it's going to be probably more complicated.	O
Animation get through.	O
She has would not.	O
So Luke is asking, do you know if it's possible to use this SVG animations and project softwares of UI UX side.	O
So yes, you can use this stuff on the web, that's why I really like using it and also in.	O
Apps so I.	O

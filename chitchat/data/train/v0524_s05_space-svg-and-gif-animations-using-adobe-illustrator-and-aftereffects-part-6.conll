So if you wanna see some like.	CHITCHAT
Really sweet SVG animation work.	CHITCHAT
I would go check out this stuff.	CHITCHAT
Because she is a master of.	CHITCHAT
The craft.	CHITCHAT
Honestly.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
I notice that I wasn't sure if I was going to actually use these.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
To do my flames like these shapes looking like the look of it.	O
Most of all, the squish less of it.	O
Please.	CHITCHAT
Send it.	CHITCHAT
And I'm gonna call this fire.	O
I do plan on animating.	O
And you plan on animating.	O
So one of the things you should be cautious about is sort of naming your.	O
Well, you have to be cautious about this when you working in after effects as well, but you want to actually you name everything.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Group everything in separated all out so you'll see over here.	O
I've kind of already gone and done some of that, although now that we're working on this new section, it's going to get more crazy.	O
And if you go back to our original.	O
And I have separated everything out.	O
I know they're going to animate this helmet highlight and I have separated old lens if I want to kind of make them away with it in space.	O
So it's just something that I keep trying to keep in the back of my mind when I'm working like half like I said, how all of this stuff kind of animates?	O
Important.	O
Point to think about.	O
We're actually going to do a small highlight on the edge of this as above.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
3.	CHITCHAT
That's why I had like a little bit of white light on the end.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm 50% passing.	O
Looks pretty nice.	CHITCHAT
Actually probably gonna convert this and just see what it looks like.	O
I'm gonna put up here.	O
Look at saying I'm seeing your animation portfolio and it's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Love your work.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, um?	CHITCHAT
Let me know if you have any questions about anything on My Portfolio and I can find.	CHITCHAT
Maybe talking meat processing hike rates in that stuff.	CHITCHAT
If you guys are interested, one of my ideas to the stream of that I would like to do.	CHITCHAT
Maybe in the future.	CHITCHAT
It would be really cool is to go back and see if I could find like really old projects I've done.	CHITCHAT
They can be anything, really, uh?	CHITCHAT
No illustrator after effects from the shop, whatever.	CHITCHAT
Just go find some little projects and like recreate them.	CHITCHAT
I've been doing this for I graduated from College in 2010 with a.	CHITCHAT
Bachelors of Fine Arts in medical illustration so.	CHITCHAT
I've kind of come along way through.	CHITCHAT
All different styles, working animation and now in the UI UX designer, so I think it would be kind of fun to go back to like my really early work.	CHITCHAT
Of course I don't even know.	CHITCHAT
Be like CS4.	CHITCHAT
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Even remember, but the earliest version with you, so I think it be fun to like recreate it, like take something really old with quite likely make it somewhere.	CHITCHAT
So you can see that why I don't want to add like otona details on the list 'cause this is sort of the size that it's going to be, although I think I want this.	O
Oh Let's look at our.	O
Jeff have rental skins with Tennessee.	O
Did you sit kind of high up like that?	O
Only like there.	CHITCHAT
Do you want to make them a little there?	O
Turn slightly.	O
Right so so far you guys have asked me for just some puppies.	O
To go on the spaceman, Spacey imports.	O
Freshie supports.	O
Those few things, I guess we're adding anybody, doesn't have any other.	O
So the actions here.	O

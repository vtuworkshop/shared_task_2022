The other day I kinda wanna add is maybe some.	O
I probably should've done that did this before I got into all the other stuff, but I'm going to add some lines here and I'm gonna edit them.	O
Make more sense after the fact Jane.	O
How is how's it going in changes?	CHITCHAT
James, one of the participants in the illustrator for challenges like to see you.	O
You sound like streams.	O
Changes some great work if you're not in illustrator discord, go check it out.	O
Go come hang out with us.	CHITCHAT
I'm always there from answering questions and we're all kind of learning together.	CHITCHAT
So I had this idea to have, like a sort of A.	O
Dashed line.	O
The boy with you and I want to get fancy.	O
Jane, we're working on this would be kind of cool.	O
I'm sorry that is probably going to repeat.	O
Be a repeat for people that have already seen it, but we're working on it.	O
Working on these space illustrations series and I've been doing animations.	O
Exporting amount of illustrators SVG is the animating them using CSS S and I've been exporting that.	O
Well, I've been importing the files into after effects animating that way so basically been showing two different methods for animating.	O
Files out of after out of illustrator of billion ways to do it, but those are the two ways that I want to focus on, mostly because I really like SVG animation at something that you a lot.	O
And because I really don't like animating and after effects, I wanna get better.	O
So little benefit to you.	CHITCHAT
A little bit of venom into me, everybody wins, so we're working on our Orion constellation.	O
But we have done a couple of these already, so let me pull it up just to show you guys.	O
Watch it again within a couple of these we did canus major and minor and this is going to be how the animation for the constellation is going to be.	O
It's going to be similar.	CHITCHAT
We have like stars pop on and draw the line withdraw and some secondary motion for the astronaut and things so.	O
This is what we did in after effects.	O
Couple times a couple strains ago we worked on the dogs.	O
You can see all the links in the replays below.	O
I need to go through and organize that, but um, I shouldn't try to separate them out by animation where we started was this consolation once I'm just hold this up and this is the after effects animation that we did.	O
This was the first thing we did was just the stars in the northern hemisphere rotating around the night Sky so you can see all the different.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
And then so that was the after effects one and then this is our SVG.	O
So you can see that they will end up being the same kind of Animation, but we animated them using two different ways, so we're going to do the same thing with this, but we wound up adding a ton of detail onto this.	O
For Ryan, one you see it got a little sketch figured out here of the International Space Station that this guys gonna be tethered to.	O
We talk about before I'm just going to keep working as I talk so we talked about before this sort of the myth.	O
The like Orion mythology and how it differs depending on the culture.	O
But in general Orion's Hunter.	O
Basically these stories were intended to.	O
Help people kind of remember the consolation so that they could use the stars for navigating so.	O
I think so.	CHITCHAT
I don't wanna spend your point there.	O
So the the story is that Orion's Hunter, right, with his two hunting dogs.	O
This perspective area behind the ISS, we've got his major in Kings minor, and there's the hair that their hunting when Scorpio is somewhere.	O
Scorpius, the the legend is that the writing is really arrogant.	O
Just say that it varies.	O
And so they.	CHITCHAT
You gotta be really mad at him and they send the scorpion sting him and kill him so.	O
Had two stars in Orion.	O
Got bills used with God Rigel 2 bright stars an Orion is a Hunter and holding typically depicted holding a club and either a high Dora Shield so to kind of represent that in like this modern context, we're going to have him holding this wrench over here and then the tether that ties him to the spaceship kind of represents the Shields got like a tool like Club is a tool without a wrench, chess or signify that we've got to tether, which is kind of like a safety.	O
Safety measure.	O

Let me know if you guys doing that.	O
I'm going to move on to.	O
I think maybe that either 'cause I think that's also pretty good thing to show.	O
No, I'm still on the fence about these little bit wide I wanted just like.	O
I'm gonna to transform each object for each and it should have a scale.	O
Both of these boxes by the same.	O
And so now.	CHITCHAT
Although that seems awful under.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I keep getting much stuff coming out my mouth my smart mouth.	O
Not lost.	CHITCHAT
My Apple.	CHITCHAT
I think I have scale serves infection known as well so might wanna turn that off.	O
Chasing This is very nice color.	O
Yeah God like powers.	CHITCHAT
Mechanic stuck with the same color palette for everything, so.	O
We are girls you I'm going to rename these.	O
Here, but I'm gonna name is like fire.	O
That sounds good.	CHITCHAT
This worries over alcohol this guy.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Of course I reorganized in the wrong way.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Z.	CHITCHAT
Well there, how's it going?	CHITCHAT
Nice to see you.	CHITCHAT
Switch out in space, work around some space.	O
Animation.	O
Haven't done much animating past couple students for this, 'cause we keep adding more and more stuff to this illustration.	O
So now we've got like.	O
Jetpacks and the International Space Station.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Well there, how's it going?	CHITCHAT
Let me know if you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
I can kind of go through the whole spiel.	CHITCHAT
Full check.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we will go through the whole spiel again.	O
We are working on these illustrations that we're going to turn into Animations, SVG Animations, and.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
After effects animations you can export from after effects you guys put out and before GIF PNG sequence turned into a different photo shop.	O
We've been doing MP fours.	O
But yeah, we've been doing these space animations.	O
Lots new friends I owe Henric Henrique.	CHITCHAT
I love that name.	CHITCHAT
I just I love it.	CHITCHAT
I let me know when pronouncing it right.	CHITCHAT
We're working on these illustrations that we're going to turn animations while they're saying great and you nice to see you too.	O
I'm doing great.	CHITCHAT
I'm the I'm having a good time.	CHITCHAT
You're having fun.	CHITCHAT
I love drawing space, hello space Donuts and dogs really like those are my favorite things.	CHITCHAT
A few.	CHITCHAT
My favorite thing so.	CHITCHAT
We're working on these animations.	O
We started out with a an animation, adjusted the constellations.	O
That's kind of weird.	O
All all this insanity began.	O
Someone call you both up for you again.	O
This is the MP 4 out of after effects of the constellations routing rotating.	O
The Northern Hemisphere.	O
We also did an SVG version of that that we that I hand.	O
He wrote the CSS S for UM in an open source code code editor called Adam.	O
I like using Adam because it has an SVG preview ad on so I can see what I'm doing is I'm doing it.	O
I promise you after he donations are not scary as they seem.	O
What you understand what's going on, and then we also did space dog nose.	O
Horses face dog's, so this is going to be similar to how we're going to do the Orion, Uh, sort of consolation animation.	O
We have all these stars and made on.	O
Camera on and the dogs are wagging their tails, so we're going to do the same kind of thing with Orion.	O
We're going to have.	O
Lost my thing there is going to have started kind of pop on and draw on and roll off and it will have some will have these planes animating will have the Highline animating here.	O
Maybe we'll have some secondary motion blends in with Heather and everything.	O
So we have a lot of this one is going to be a lot more complex 'cause.	O
We had a whole bunch of stuff.	O

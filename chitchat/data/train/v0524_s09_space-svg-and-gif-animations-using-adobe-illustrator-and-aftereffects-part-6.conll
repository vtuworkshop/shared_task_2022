Call miss here too man.	CHITCHAT
So many friends and chat will be saying alterations looking good Daniela Animations look dope too.	CHITCHAT
Thank you um.	CHITCHAT
We're getting we're making our way.	CHITCHAT
I do not think we're going to get to animating anytime students.	O
People lot stuff to do so, so got our little ISS International Space Station over here.	O
It's got it's either 2 and we're going to put a wrench in his hand.	O
I kinda went over.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start working on this tether here.	O
Doing service and laughing because we're animating.	O
This is an SVG, uhm, I'm gonna try to stick to a couple different ways.	O
You could do this.	CHITCHAT
Heather 'cause I want to have a tether that's like a line through it.	O
Basically that has like little dashes on it and maybe a highlight.	O
Second of all is well, you see similar to highlight we did on the helmet, but because we're doing SVG.	O
I want there's a couple of ways.	O
You could draw a line you could use a blend made custom brush or we can do the same thing that we did for these guys here, we can use Kona dashed lines and I think we're going to dash lines because we're doing.	O
SVG animation and if they won't the dash lights won't translate or will translate well custom brushes and.	O
Starts in like couple stroke with profiles and stuff like that they don't translate to SVG, so it's just something to keep in mind that this stuff.	O
So I'm going to work on the tether.	O
Now this is the shape that we've got going on.	O
I kind of like the idea of it coming off and going back on here.	O
So, but we do need to put it sort of behind.	O
Put it into parts fresh cake at the idea of having a port sort of on.	O
Space is we're going to add some chords, like maybe like you know, like right along here.	O
Maybe we can have this kind of come around and then come back up over the shoulder so we will start with the portion sizes.	O
Drove a lot.	O
So we may add some life quotes on there.	O
Yeah, we could have talked about, uh?	O
The reason them adding all these kind of things onto the.	O
This illustration is because of the.	O
We talked a bit about the Lake Orion mythology.	O
So we're basically doing a modern take each became's major minor kind of showed the Dogos.	O
Representing the mythology of the constellation so.	O
We are sorry doing a similar thing here.	O
Why am I having that were kind of showcasing the mythology through.	O
Remind me I was trying to say I'm doing mythology through this, so the original store.	O
Brian is a Hunter.	O
Stories just hold to help people remember the stars.	O
People identified in the Sky, so Ryan is carrying a club in high Dora Shields.	O
You got the same kind of idea we're going to put a wrench in his hand and this tether is sort of wrapping around.	O
It said there being kind of like a representation of the shield is kind of like a safety measure, I guess.	O
And then the wrenches tool so.	O
Or weapons pending.	O
See unfortunately out they were getting animating today.	O

Sort of front of this goes into space, right?	CHITCHAT
Like I don't know, you know, I've seen spaces.	CHITCHAT

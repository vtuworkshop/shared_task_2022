For fun We have different sizes and styles, not 100% sure.	O
Who started down a bit?	O
They are a little big and will say, Well, you know what I do wanna do you wanna turn off scale starts in effect so I threw it out to chat about like what kind of patches we should add to our space suit?	O
Or we got puppies.	CHITCHAT
If anybody else in the inner suggestions for, uh, some patches you can throw on here and would love to hear them.	O
But obviously I'm down for a puppies 'cause I love puppies.	O
Center of these looks a little bit too big.	O
I don't think we need that larger good scaping from space you.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
I still feel like probably need like a.	O
Oh, let's see here.	CHITCHAT
So I've got I've got I've just got up at the top here like a Google image search faster.	O
We've been primarily going off of the NASA SpaceX ones, 'cause there's most recent space suits, and I want to do something that looks pretty modern, but.	O
We look at the older versions in spaces.	O
We should see some with some life quotes and dangly bits.	O
Another great resource had talked about before is the NASA Image Archive.	O
Sound like a.	O
It does however really likes in.	O
Part and not like a lot of surface but.	O
Cigars will have a little bit bigger spot on it.	O
Yeah, well look at that.	O
Looks like a center part.	O
I could look at space photos all day so.	O
Um Onassis Image Archive is really great if you want to check out, so it's like a lot of public domain images.	O
But you can use some of them for reference.	O
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
But I can't decide.	CHITCHAT
It looks like the outside part of the port also has like a little bit about highlight on here yet.	O
App.	O
I mean some his shadow.	O
We had a highlight on the outside, but I might compete with the white part.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we don't and such a strong highlight on the edge of this this problem solving right now.	O
Why do you like snow?	O
Z.	CHITCHAT
I said I wasn't gonna make these really detailed and here we are.	O
People.	O
For those of you that have never joined by streams before, I'm Jack Hedley in the UI, UX designer.	O
That's why do you doing?	CHITCHAT
Everything.	CHITCHAT
But I love it.	CHITCHAT
So, but I also have a lot of experience in illustrator an animator.	O
My degree is medical illustration.	O
Flash there Fine Arts in medical illustration.	O
So I did it for a long time I think a lot of animating so that's my background.	O
So I do like to do a lot of illustration and animation, even if it's not.	O
It's still part of my work Tuesday, so those are cute.	O
I kind of like them.	CHITCHAT
Kind of nervous at first, but I kinda like.	O
Yeah, I don't know why the NASA new SpaceX like uniform forms spacesuits or so.	O
We're so like clean compared to, you know.	O
Is it past feeling could also even add like some companies like just some tubes coming off like going over and under, but I feel like you could like it.	O
Did the Delta animated to do that?	O
And this is where we put the puppy.	O
I don't wanna put it on sleep right?	O
So?	CHITCHAT
That's the thing.	CHITCHAT
I forgot to put it here as well.	O
I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
What one?	CHITCHAT
Quote.	CHITCHAT
Where things start to get crazy, like my internal bilayers when they have to go back later after the screen and fix it all.	O
I don't know like I like this is a good spot for the puppy Patch.	O
I just don't know if it's really.	O
And again I spent a ton of time.	O

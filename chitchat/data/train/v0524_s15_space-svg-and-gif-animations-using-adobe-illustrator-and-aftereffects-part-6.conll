Right now we want to do that.	O
'cause I, well, we have two choices.	O
We can either do.	O
You had more details when we ask, not, which I feel like we've been working on for awhile, or we could add work on sort of the shapes for the International Space Station.	O
I think it would go with that.	O
Just 'cause I wanna get like a larger portion of this done and then maybe we can get to animating tomorrow.	O
My goal is to get their meeting tomorrow so we'll see if that happens but.	O
Let me do.	CHITCHAT

I just want to look and see what the.	O
Got these panels less.	O
I'm going to start with.	O
We can illustrate them flat and it's only perspective because I want to get that nice grid pattern on it.	O
And maybe also.	O
She colors for this and what like a blue one is gold.	O
It has like this iridescent quality to it.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
OK well.	CHITCHAT
If you guys ever do you have any questions about like strings of two more than happy there?	CHITCHAT
Talk about that as well.	CHITCHAT
I'm here for you.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Hey Josh.	CHITCHAT
So you have like an outer edge on the boards and was gonna be pretty light facing up.	O
So what is up in this case for my illustration?	O
So I'm going again.	O
He's one of my favorite tools, talked about it before is the.	O
Awesome path.	O
Try to see yellow celebrate.	O
Colors would be working.	O
Why did you leave the negative value to add a little bit of the simple shapes that bring it back up?	O
Reason I do that instead of.	O
Scaling.	O
Provide duplicate this.	O
And I just scale this down.	O
You can see that it doesn't scale it.	O
It scales it like uniformly to itself, but not necessarily just outside.	O
But the reason I use that offset path is that it adds, adds or takes away.	O
Like increases decreases with distance based on those like pixel numbers.	O
So like it's going to going to bring it in 10 pixels on each side, or techniques without final size.	O
So I like doing that because it gives me a sequel.	O
Facing.	O
Just passed it.	O
What?	CHITCHAT
Control panel does not want to laugh.	O
Who was anymore?	O
Oh no, what is happening?	CHITCHAT
We reset my workspace.	CHITCHAT
When all else fails, reset your workspace.	O
Oh my gosh, what is happening?	CHITCHAT
For a second here.	CHITCHAT
Plus I don't know what's happening.	CHITCHAT
And I am using the latest version.	CHITCHAT
Like him?	CHITCHAT
Siri open I don't know what's happening.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Open Finder.	O
Hear something.	O
Yeah, of course saying Oh no, that made it worse.	O
That's OK, we got it.	CHITCHAT
We can handle.	O
I love the new running stream that's kind of going back to like old school like white with image in set over here.	O
Oh, it's coming over here now be good.	O
Alright, I stuck it back, yeah.	O
I don't know what I did to break.	O
I'm sorry I broke the Australian guys but I fixed it.	O
No, there's watches that I love working with watch is.	O
I think I started this thought earlier and I can finish it.	O
Um, the reasons I like.	O
Just watch it is that it's.	O
Makes it really easy to change colors and we have a pretty good chunk of this done, so I can actually demonstrate that so you can use edit colors, but because I've composed everything with Swatch is 2 things that like one immediately limits me from using every color in the rainbow, which is really useful when you build a color palette you stay within it.	O
I can add change watch is listed as you can see, our color palette had scrum a bit as we can.	O
Illustrations, but if I wanted too for this one quite a bit.	O
I can really hear anyone clients like you have.	O
Actually, I don't really like that clean.	O
Can you change it to blue?	O
I can use?	CHITCHAT
Saturation can use.	O
This sliders here and it changes all of the colors.	O
Are you my file?	O
Q.	CHITCHAT
Whenever I change it to write.	O
Not only that, but it also keeps because I'm using Swatch percentage of slots filled, it also keeps the.	O
Love percentages, so I think I use like 25% so it keeps your shading as well.	O

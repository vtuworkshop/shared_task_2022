You know with any of that we check in college.	O
Should hot tips that I liked.	O
Makes changing colors really easy and I also just feel like it gives me better control like I like the.	O
Values like it here versus like a brightness slider.	O
It doesn't always give you like you.	O
Sometimes you're colored heels looking buddy.	O
How you show your colors for sorry I am late no don't worry about Denver so my process for selecting colleges.	O
Usually pretty intuitive.	CHITCHAT
I like really bright colors.	O
Typically I like to go with.	O
I try to keep to ask you.	CHITCHAT
Personally and then you know the color palette.	O
He's do expand versus we start out with too many.	O
You can get you know choice paralysis.	O
So I like to just start with like a really a dark shadow midtone highlight.	O
It may be a couple of variations between that's that's that's one way to do it.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I have a couple of Ways and I do it.	O
I usually like to think about like what sort of color valued.	O
Want like my stration I'm doing too, so I'm doing like line illustration something like this.	O
I'll think about like work.	O
Hello, I want the line work to be and then also then like what color I want the pills to be and like go from there.	O
I don't typically work with straight black like 100% K Black or RGB black just because I don't.	O
That I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it's a holdover from like my Fine Arts education that like you don't ever use pure black.	O
I like.	CHITCHAT
Black's got a little bit of tone to it.	O
Or even know black like I've done like colored line.	O
I will color blind, why not?	O
I don't know, uh, for this specifically, I knew that I wanted to do a pastel spacing that was my original inspiration for this.	O
'cause back a couple challenges ago were doing space bubble illustration illustrator channels together in space illustrations and I just really for some reason my brain was like we need to draw up at cell space.	O
Seem like a space seen component prizing tired and pass out covered so that's where it started.	O
Background here, she's like he's really like flus, and things like teals, and like salmon colors.	O
That's like I had in my head images like stars and constellations, and like these light, totally different than what you normally see, like he's really, really light.	O
Colorful colors next we have started and then as we started to do these more complex illustrations of the dogs and astronaut we need to add some more darts and need to add some more colors that contrast with that like the Reds and the dark purple so.	O
Park challenge yes gave me the inspiration mythology present so very cool you gonna pull some heavy hand says love to see it.	O
I think it's something you will make sure.	CHITCHAT
Pretty sure I am.	O
Open up a new tab so.	O
Yeah I, I'm very like I don't, uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't know those.	CHITCHAT
I think every artist has a different way of sort of picking colors while they're working just now.	O
Like right or wrong answer I guess.	O
It just comes down to personal preference, obviously.	O
This is the opposite way, but I wanted to be.	O
She was a lighter parts.	O
Awesome, nothing in this color, so we can change that.	O
What color are the speed?	O
He I don't want to make this too dark.	O
Make this.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Are you that I can make this document Rd?	O
Image do you like?	O
I don't know, you know like this color combination, but we'll see.	O
I probably shouldn't use the properties panel.	O
Yeah, I don't like that.	CHITCHAT
He I kind of want there's like an ear, doesn't quality to this, so I'm trying to figure it out.	O

Please close really work for me.	O
This is so bad.	CHITCHAT
Friend.	CHITCHAT
A bit too much, I don't know.	O
Maybe we just go with yellow for the.	O
Highlights Not that I really want to get into highlights right now.	O
One work pattern on this.	O
Can you use the point over that I can wear with that?	O
No non polar grid?	O
Correcting with Jennifer Pool saying I'd think I did post it, but if I did it in the other design others taken so long.	O
I have to go look at it again.	O
Oh no.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Never had this work, so that's pretty good already.	O
Just write up that heater close up even with the.	O
That was.	O
Hotel himself with my actually out of like a.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Just using the arrow keys to change the.	O
Number of rows and columns.	O
So look, us is asking me how I made this guy right here.	O
I can go over that with the conclusion.	O
How about questions you guys be coming?	O
Oh, that's not what I wanted.	O
I'm trying to move this out-of-the-way.	O
I have somehow like.	O
Someone to give you this sketch over here.	O
So yeah, I did a similar type of thing when I worked on.	O
The Sky Your Ryan.	O
I had that.	CHITCHAT
You can see where we kind of started here.	O
So that was my sketch from the astronaut.	O
I really need it so I changed my mind.	O
But when I did this guy here and I do this a lot and unfortunately my Android game is just not working and try again.	O
Yeah, but like second camera I have an overhead camera and she's not picking up.	O
Today, so Fortunately you will be able to see me online, but I have some teeth right in front of me.	O
So, uhm.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So many windows have to navigate, so yeah, I use, uh, I set up a brush with pressure sensitivity.	O
I'll show you how to do that really quickly, but I'm handling it here, but all my star brushes.	O
That's a good one to just go back and watch the first consolation part one of this whole thing where I showed you need scatter brushes.	O
So, uhm, I can make a new brush.	O
I'm going to choose a calligraphic.	O
I hate this word.	CHITCHAT
I cannot pronounce it.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry somebody out there let me know how to pronounce this but.	O
A calligraphic brush.	O
Anyways, I'm gonna go change the size.	O
You can change all of these settings in here to make a brush how you want.	O
But I just take me to pick a very basic pressure.	O
This is just kind of when I start with when I'm sketching illustrator or probably 20 minutes later.	O
So I think I used the dark colored folders.	O
I just kind of Drew.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
You can see that as I draw a apply more pressure, it follows the.	O
There's like a little.	O
Now you see it very well.	CHITCHAT
There's like a little.	O
Flex to the pen tip so it.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Push harder, it can register the pressure of that screen so.	O
Sizes for us.	O
You should be able to see a little bit better and you can see there a little bit more.	O
Actually, there's another little super secret area to these brushes that not everybody knows about that I was showing you.	O
You double tap on this.	O
You get paint brush options similar to adjusting the smoothing toothbrushes in Cresco.	O

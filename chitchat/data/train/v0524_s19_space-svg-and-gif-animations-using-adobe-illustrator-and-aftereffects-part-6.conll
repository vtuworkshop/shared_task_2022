I can drag up or down this Fidelity here and if I have it set all the way up to smooth it's going to make a line that has.	O
Your point, and it's going to like smooth it out, right?	O
She's not there.	CHITCHAT
I have probably like 4 points.	O
I gotta couple more returns.	O
Probably did all this low, so if I go back here and I bring it all the way down when I draw.	O
You cannot follow my.	O
Find a lot more closer and add a lot more points.	O
You can see if I zoom in here.	O
How smooth this line is versus this light and he's got 100 points right.	O
But there is an easy way to fix that, if you did.	O
Wanna, like use that live forever.	O
Even we just want to make it less crazy.	O
You could go to path.	O
Simplified, and that woman's near points.	O
I have it just like to auto, but you can specify the number of.	O
Cuisine or let's make that so.	O
That's all the way up there were all the way down to the Lake as few points possible to keep that curve so.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Brushes in illustrator in order to do that.	O
Like I said I just.	O
That that brush up and I just kinda start to draw out the shapes.	O
You can see that it's not perfect in here like mean things line up.	O
I'm just trying to get a general idea.	O
And I'll go in and modify like when I do.	O
These solar panels.	O
I like probably why did I started out with like here's the line whatever and I'll go in or like alright I don't need it.	O
I don't need to like.	O
Wacky Stroke the rats going here.	O
Like adjust some things right?	O
The line them up and then once I'm done I'll like here with a section of this here, because these are all the same kind of solar panels cop, you know, I'll just group them all and copy and paste them along here.	O
I like sketching in illustrator.	O
Because it gives me a vector path so that I can use comes from my background as a production artist.	O
What you have to do everything really fast and really efficiently and so I.	O
Pick up this habit of sketching illustrator because I can go right from sketch to final art.	O
If I need too.	O
and I can use these as like.	O
These are vector path so I can like.	O
I can move this and manipulate this around just like I would any other sort of vector inside the scale, strokes and effects on.	O
It gives me a vector sketch that I can manipulate in illustrator.	O
before I go to final, I find it to be really handy.	O
If you do need to do sketches for a client to make changes really quickly as well.	O
And also I do use this as a style for rendering.	O
Side I have plenty of examples where I had just used a line line art sensually.	O
Line and fill, you know, use this counter so.	O
Kelly graphic brush to do.	O
Translation Website trying to find a really great example of that.	O
Anymore my sketches.	O
Oh, here's an example of one that uses a lot of lines, so I did this like dogs, right?	O
And this is really just using that, uhm?	O
That process, right?	O
Right, I'm just using the brush strokes to basically make that illustration with just some fills added on after the fact, and that's what I did.	O
So I did there.	CHITCHAT
So look at it, saying yeah, really cool brought my bought my graphic tablet.	O
But I'm not ready.	CHITCHAT
Yet was easier to use Photoshop and illustrator, Yeah II think that she's different.	O
Photoshop certainly has a lot of you can get really deep into the customization of the brushes in Photoshop and to the point where you're like it feels like really like like real materials.	O
You can get a little bit enough, I mean II've definitely went down a rabbit hole at a point in my life where I was trying to recreate like how how far can I like push the brushes in?	O
It was trader and I did this like I started out.	O
I just don't finish the like water scene.	O
You guys are well this guy.	CHITCHAT

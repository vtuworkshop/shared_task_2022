So yeah, that's a lot of rush fresh troops.	O
This is entirely done in.	O
In illustrator.	O
Yeah, I really tried to like push the brush brush line work in that one.	O
But yeah, so you can have you have a lot of options for.	O
Brushes, and that's another thing I want to do is like a stream just where I go over like different types of brushes and how to edit them so I do have.	O
I have a couple of different tips and tricks for using brushes illustrated that I've plan really handy and speed up your workflow up showing the scatter brush trick.	O
But you can also use like pattern brushes in our brushes and then you can expand the appearance on them for example and use graphic styles and apply gradients and it will apply the radial gradient to the objects.	O
And the gradients will all be the same spot.	O
It's really handy, so maybe a little bit.	O
The Hills are have anything like to Stevens status and sorry from espousing your name.	O
Stephanie was asking you to have anything like the whole to snap features that spend added 2 fresco.	O
So do you mean for like the straight lines usually hold like shift?	O
I don't think it has it from freshes you don't never actually tried to.	O
Oh yeah, look at that, you can.	O
So if you hold down shift it will keep your line straight.	O
Like Like a perfect We may not.	O

Nail share is actually yelling at my illustrator last night because it doesn't work like photo shop.	O
Yes well, illustrator will never be Photoshop because it's not the same.	O
You certainly can get like really nice soft rendering in illustrator.	O
It's just.	CHITCHAT
Difficult.	O
Let's how difficult it can become intensive on your computer to surrender all of that.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
So we're getting close the industry.	O
We have about 20 minutes left, so maybe I will go over a little bit of that sweat.	O
Maybe will transition to you guys want to see I can look them over it with that.	O
Personally, I can't think of any way I can using this illustrations like it certainly show you guys when I talked about that excited and our brush so you can use gradients, clean brushes, but you can use rabbit styles to apply bredius after the fact.	O
Well, I mean by that, so we're gonna make a brush out of this chain of circles, essentially.	O
So let's start with this guy right here.	O
Make this black.	O
And let's make a fun radio radio radio right now looking up pop open line from the router status.	O

Yes.	CHITCHAT
Cortana.	CHITCHAT
Let's do something.	CHITCHAT
So that Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Right, and, uh, I want to edit this radial gradients I wanted to.	O
It's not very good radio.	O
I want to edit this gradient like kind of a specific.	O
Position here.	O
Right, right, I want to have like I want this to have like a specific part of it, right?	O

Try using a brush illustration that they can't.	O
So, uh.	CHITCHAT
Wanna make anything?	CHITCHAT
Ha.	CHITCHAT
Sonny's is a gradient, but we really need to have a line of these circles.	O
Whatever reason enough and we need them to have the same gradient applied.	O
So I'm going to add my radiant to my graphic style.	O
I'm going to take this guy and we say, well, I'm going to best you 'cause I know that I can make some art brush out of this.	O
I can't remember.	CHITCHAT
No, it is not fun.	CHITCHAT

Sorry, got technical technical difficulties.	CHITCHAT
All right back out.	CHITCHAT
Things are going alright, so um.	CHITCHAT
Couple things you might not know about inrush window.	O
You can drag this out.	O
This is the shapes that comprise your brushes.	O
Cool thing you can do with this as you can start to edit these and anything that's inside of this box essentially is going to be a part of your brush.	O
So if I take these I can drag the shapes out and I can edit them and I can instruct them both again for my pin alter option click and drag them and replace the.	O
Watch.	CHITCHAT
So now you see change this rush.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Because it's like already a circle, it's like past.	O
It's not really.	CHITCHAT
Hi.	CHITCHAT
If we were using, if you wanted to things to like line up perfectly, a quick way to do that would be to.	O

I don't know if you had like a 2 lines like if you were trying to make a brush and you want to like perfectly connected, you're getting weird gas from this can use this and like make the shape sort of expands just passed though.	O
Like think of this invisible boxes like your clipping mask.	O
He expanded just little bit process there and let's sometimes it get fixed.	O

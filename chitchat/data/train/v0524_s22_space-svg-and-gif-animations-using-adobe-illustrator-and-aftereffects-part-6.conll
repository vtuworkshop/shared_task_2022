You have a brush.	O
Doesn't like repeat exactly how you want it nonetheless?	O
Maybe we should have a minute, but I want to make this sort of.	O
Funky Circle line.	O
Yes, right there go all over the place, why not?	O
I still cannot find my brush window by the way, so I'm going to take this shape.	O
Dragon.	O
Just to get some idea.	O
You re up my graphic style window.	O
Why is your self?	O
They were coming to expand this brush.	O
Jacks I have spent appearance.	O
Always show up.	O
And now I can apply this maybe?	O
Maybe I.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Make sure is not clipping masks.	O
Who won the prize clipping mask?	O
No.	CHITCHAT
Looks all good to me.	CHITCHAT
Hello replying to all of that there we go so you can see that it applied that radio gradient and it kept the.	CHITCHAT
Position of the.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
The highlight in the upper left that we made versus how are just like apply this gradient again.	O
It's just going to put it in the center and I want that we want it to look like this.	O
So if I use that.	O
That all my round super handy saying that you may never actually have to use, but it's a good quick trick if you want to apply a gradient to objects inside of a brush you could or or just the same radial gradient or just the same gradient settings in general to multiple objects.	O
You can add that as a graphic style and it keeps saying like.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Positioning information I guess about the gradient inside of the circle essentially, and I can apply this to.	O
As far as well as you can see it, it keeps that position right so.	O
And the old risks.	O
That you may find yourself needing to use if you have to ever Draw Something that has a lot of radio gradients, or you know you could use this for like a string of pearls or something.	O
Yeah, anything that you want to use.	O
A gradient foreign brush, but you can't actually like.	O
You could use this for sprinkles, well or not.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Do you have any questions that is just one example of brush.	O
I wish that I could get my life brush will go there.	O
Doesn't wanna cooperate.	O
So I'll try to show you on this.	O
Maybe this is standard default brush and strangers.	O
I can actually drive.	O
Start fresh.	O
Anyway, you can use that alt drag to edit the shapes in brushes, so so.	O
Five times you know I have like 5 minutes so we did not get through everything I wanted to today.	O
Honey got sucked into this whole like.	O
Rabbit sized thing.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, probably be no more L train tomorrow.	O
Fortunately I did wanna finish and get into after effects but after effects.	O
I will get to it tomorrow.	O

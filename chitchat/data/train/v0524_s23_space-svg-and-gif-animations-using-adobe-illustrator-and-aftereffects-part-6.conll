Let me catch you up on the chat here.	CHITCHAT
Definitely say cool.	CHITCHAT
I only have the size of package right now, but might be full teachers here.	O
Yeah, I like it.	CHITCHAT
I mean I I had the full of things and even sponsor sometimes just play the software that you didn't even know about.	O
Spark of it certainly would not have similar product keys.	O
Yes, often he at Jennifer pool saying watch out they get addictive.	O
Yeah, there's a lot of software like you don't even realize like so much stuff.	O
Is out there a character animator is another one that I would like to give ago.	O
Um, perhaps this it looks pretty fun.	O
Obviously fresco Lightroom.	O
I played around in Lightroom, uhm, not too long ago, didn't know anything about that, you know, like?	O
I see, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Of course, saying there was just an update, so there might be some bugs.	CHITCHAT
Yes, OK, you know it happens.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Stephanie saying, I can see you space for XD my day job and already use definitive designer for vector drawing.	CHITCHAT
A few DTP happens.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Infinity is another vector.	CHITCHAT
That's a drawing program.	CHITCHAT
They you can export SVG, Rihanna.	CHITCHAT
Whether I think that it also hasn't pixel side to it, I'm not really familiar.	CHITCHAT
Definite saying it makes sense to consolidate as much as possible to one suite.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's that's the.	CHITCHAT
The nice thing about working, um, another bonus still working in illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Is that I?	CHITCHAT
When I work in um.	CHITCHAT
Axia yes later I can pull.	CHITCHAT
I can literally copy and paste stuff from illustrator directly into XD.	CHITCHAT
So which has been super helpful.	CHITCHAT
I can talk about this little bit before, but if you really want to get you out of rabbit hole and you really start getting into SVG Animations.	O
Then you will find that you become really familiar with how illustrator creates path vector path.	O
So I'll show it creates a basic coordinate grid, but it's not.	O
It's a complicated coordinate grid, right?	O
Because it's also it's a coordinate grid that that's not just like points in X&Y space, but also points in relative position to other points.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
That's not really important.	CHITCHAT
For this, but when you copy and paste things out of illustrator in into XD, you can start to do more complicated animating animating slash with the programming tools.	O
I get some really cool things to happen if you understand.	O
That the objects you bring it would have to basically be the same points manipulated in space, so the arrangement of points if you draw circle 1234 it has to match between our boards in.	O
In XG and if they do match, actually will know to animals how to animate between those two points when you use.	O
Auto animate just little handle trip trick.	O
Uhm, I did show if you do want to go back and watch.	O
Maybe Corey can share link.	CHITCHAT
We don't have alot of time but if you want to go back and watch my Donut I think it's not.	O
It should be on line being a page.	O
Do you want to go back and watch me make the donut app with Howard on day two of the prototyping I show how I use.	O
The pie chart tool in illustrator to make masks for the donor illustrations so that when I animate use auto animate, the points specially that really quick when you use can you make a pie chart.	O
It does like a really handy thing for you.	O
Right, if I don't make any values and he said 200, it adds this life.	O
Place here, so that's basically nothing.	O
This is really handy because when you.	O
Are animating in XD.	O
It's trying to connect these points right?	O
So if you wanted to have something animated behind this mask, right?	O
For example, and you wanted to have a color like animating circle around or just like a circle chart filling in, you can use.	O
Quad chart.	O
Porn.	O
Illustrator.	O
I want my.	CHITCHAT

Alrighty hey everyone, today no is going to be hanging out with me, so it's not just me noise in the background.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Screaming in the background.	CHITCHAT
That's always good.	CHITCHAT
Um, so today we are shifting tempo away from the more long study that I have been doing.	O
I fancied everything but faster, and we're going to be doing gesture studies, so this is something that I am personally kind of nervous about streaming, because I anything that's fast and loose.	O
Get really uptight and scared.	CHITCHAT
I'm definitely like a rendering like spending 40 hours on something kind of person, not someone who's confident doing 5 minute drawings.	O
So we're going to be doing this today.	O
I thought there's no better way than like to gain confidence in something than doing it publicly, so we're going to be shaking some bad roads today.	O
I'm just going to do this so I did a few and I paste them on Twitter and I actually been pretty clearly turning out so we gotta carry on doing these.	O
If you guys want to access the reference pack that I'm using, there's a link.	O
In the assets along with this video.	O
So hello to everyone joining us.	CHITCHAT
All Lego notice posted that in chat.	CHITCHAT
So yeah you can.	CHITCHAT
You can join along with that if you fancy.	CHITCHAT
300 and one of the sample packs right?	O
Quite possibly.	CHITCHAT
And the.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Now there's a free one.	CHITCHAT
The second sample pack needed.	CHITCHAT
Awesome.	CHITCHAT
Thanks honey.	CHITCHAT
So my son, I've opened a bunch of reference photos and I'm planning to not keeping a strict timer on these because that's just too large inviting for me, but I am probably going to be spending kind of maybe like 10 minutes on them, not focusing on accuracy of proportions, but more focusing on trying to get a sense of movement exaggerating proportions.	O
Yeah, trying to get a really strong gesture and a sense of movement throughout so.	O
Yeah, I'm going to be using it.	O
Basically a hard round brush that I've played around with to make a bit more organic so it's actually got a new layer so.	O
It's just basically like a hard round that I've made into an Oval based machine.	O
It and added a slight texture and capacity controls, so that's all I'm going to be using.	O
It's pretty easy.	O
Say Hey Alright, let's get going.	O
Start with the paint like I.	O
I don't have a good workflow for this yet an I.	O
Especially the whole talking all doing this.	O
This is going to be a challenge for me.	O
Keeping it really simple.	O
Start by getting like the tilt with the shoulders and their hips and also the way that that also is facing is really important so.	O
Making me wanna figure drawing well then why don't you?	O
At work.	O
Well, now you know how it feels.	O
I mean sitting next you doing so many figure during the last couple of weeks before I get you back.	O
But yeah, I think you mentioned something that I think is really important gestures, because that you're not putting a time limit on 'cause everyone thinks that.	O
Jasper Johns pass be done fast.	O
But they don't have to be super fast, right?	O
Getting gesture is kind of almost an analytical process.	O
And sometimes going slow with this kind of handy, right?	O
'cause like you happily.	O
Stylized stuff and interpret stuff to get the Jester.	O
So yeah, configure tree.	O
Yeah, sure, hurrying.	O
It just like I just said.	O
Never enjoyed hurrying study that I understand why, but for me, that's a very specific skill set that you're learning.	O
I don't think it necessarily makes you a better artist.	O
It makes you a faster artist.	O
I understand what is the boiling down to got something hard?	O
Time these legs.	O
But I feel like I personally learned just more fun things when I'm when I'm free to think about it.	O
It's more important to me than thinking about what I'm studying.	O
Then I'm doing it really fast.	O
How are you guys doing today?	CHITCHAT

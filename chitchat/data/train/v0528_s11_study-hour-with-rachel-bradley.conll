No.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
Little Kelly	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
Fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
Effectively you yeah I kind of made that one up, but I thought it would be good to help it read.	O
It isn't quite like that in the reference, but I decided that having that there would be a good indicator of what's in front of behind and.	O
And just like is a sense of 3D that.	O
Try to slide around in this timeline for her to play into.	O
This pros might make it.	O
Do you think I need to drop that head down a little bit?	O
Set too high.	O
What did you find to the right?	O
This handy having an artist spell, slave labor help.	O
Right, This is wrong.	CHITCHAT
I'm just raising Melissa's thoughts on what we were saying.	CHITCHAT
One thing I do want to mention there so she said that.	CHITCHAT
I think your followers came more about your lives then you might imply.	CHITCHAT
That's absolutely true, but I think that that is because we've kind of gone out of our way to be nice.	CHITCHAT
Well, followers.	CHITCHAT
My point is, if all we did was post pictures and not try to kind of engage back, they probably would care a little bit less.	CHITCHAT
I think we're carrying it can be a one way thing, but I think that the caring becomes more genuine minutes or two way exchange when people are engaging with us and we are engaging back, I always think that's a little bit more of a genuine care, I suppose.	CHITCHAT
But then this is just false work faster.	CHITCHAT
There are plenty of people who had phenomenal success in their fans care.	CHITCHAT
Great deal about them without that side of things.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it's.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's kind of something that happens after people like here is that they start terrorizing.	CHITCHAT
Only you can.	CHITCHAT
Family room itself from nothing coming in.	CHITCHAT
Assume that people are something that I care about you like why you're just Larry Art and stuff, right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that's more of a symptom of growing ventilated, followed, right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, didn't mean to imply dial followers don't care about us.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, right absolutely.	CHITCHAT
Shopping in Florida do.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, now they definitely put in my 2.	CHITCHAT
It's better if you assume that.	CHITCHAT
Maybe just seem rather than to it than to assume they don't care to assume that you have to own that.	CHITCHAT
Care is probably the more accurate thing to describe their.	CHITCHAT
It's best not to assume that someone will care by default, because that by default is implies like a one-way exchange, like you're not giving anything but you expect people to care for you.	CHITCHAT
Which is.	CHITCHAT
That's quite a selfish take, I think.	CHITCHAT
Be honest with me.	CHITCHAT
Feel like we have a genuine back and forth of care with our followers.	CHITCHAT
Was so grateful.	CHITCHAT
Alrighty, probably long enough in this one is a lot about it.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
My feeling quite I've ever had too skinny.	CHITCHAT
I think white white.	CHITCHAT
Nickel out inside of it.	CHITCHAT
Last July.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I think if I spent one that's going to get into like picking out details and not necessarily bad at making it better.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you know, I feel like I did an OK job of salvaging something that was started very difficult.	CHITCHAT
Kind of got it there.	CHITCHAT
Like Exercise for my side.	CHITCHAT
She.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
I think it was really challenging if you can't see the legs, but I might have to do that flurry of fabric to kind of feel that honestly.	CHITCHAT
Guitar.	CHITCHAT

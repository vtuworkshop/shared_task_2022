Thank you so much for joining me today.	CHITCHAT
It's a beautiful day and I kid you not.	CHITCHAT
It's another beautiful weekend.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful Saturday here in Toronto.	CHITCHAT
I think every weekend has been so beautiful.	CHITCHAT
We're so lucky let me know where you're joining in from in the chat so today we are going to be designing as you can see in the background.	CHITCHAT
This really cool three typography scene.	O
In Adobe Dimension, in 3D is all the rage right now.	O
So now this time to learn how to use some free software out there.	O
Alright, so before we jump right in.	CHITCHAT
As always, be sure to head on over to XL pixel com where you can download today's design template.	CHITCHAT
That way you can follow along with me and design alongside me.	CHITCHAT
And what better ways to learn then to learn as you're being taught something right?	CHITCHAT
So be sure to download today's design template.	CHITCHAT
So I just want to quickly shut out some amazing 3D artists that I came across an I definitely admire their work.	CHITCHAT
So shut out to Roman.	CHITCHAT
He is a 3D designer and his Behance portfolio is just simply gorgeous.	CHITCHAT
I'm loving the colors I'm loving the seems that he's created.	CHITCHAT
I think this is just so incredible.	CHITCHAT
I'm very creative, very abstract, and just lovely, just lovely.	CHITCHAT
And also I wanted to shadow.	CHITCHAT
Aninat are definitely an inspiration in regards to using Adobe dimension.	CHITCHAT
She just made some really really great 3D scenes as well in Adobe Dimension which is so cool and she also has some tutorials.	CHITCHAT
I think she has a YouTube channel so be sure to check out her portfolio and follow her 'cause her work is awesome.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now that we've gotten that out of the way, I first want to head on over to Adobe color because before I approach any design project, I always like to search different colors that I can potentially use to create my designs or my scenes.	O
So what I love to do is I love to go to the explore page on Adobe color.	O
And I love to look for different colors.	O
I can use an shadow to Joe Smith.	O
Thank you for tuning in.	CHITCHAT
Hello, Alright, so the I guess the field that I want to go to design my scene is softap.	O
I want nice soft pretty colors so in the explore page I'm just going to search for soft and it's going to automatically populate different color palettes that are under the keyword software that are using colors.	O
Or color palettes that use that keyword.	O
So I'm seeing some pink.	O
I'm seeing Flowers.	O
I'm seeing soft Blues.	O
Green, so many color palettes to choose from, but I think I'm going to use some pink.	O
I'm good.	CHITCHAT
I'm definitely going to use a pink color schemes.	O
So I think this is a really nice color scheme, so just getting a sense of you know how I'm going to guess, style, my scene and color my scene.	O
So now that I have that in mind, let's head on over to Adobe Dimension.	O
So let me switch my scene.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is Adobe dimension and we have our scene setup.	O
So if you download these project file we have our scene and the size of Arsene is 1080 by 1080.	O
That's the size for an Instagram photo or just a photo that you can easily share on social media because I want you guys to by the end of this stream be able to walk away.	O
That's a cool project that you can add to your portfolio.	O
And also take me on social media at XL pixel with two ells.	O
Here your work with me 'cause I love to see what you create.	O
Alright, so we have our scene set up.	O
The only thing I'm going to do now is I want to design some walls.	O
I want the floor and I want a wall to kind of set up the background of Arsene.	O
So what I'm going to do is right under basic shapes I'm going to select plane.	O
So now that we have a plane on Arsene, I'm just going to rename this layer to floor.	O

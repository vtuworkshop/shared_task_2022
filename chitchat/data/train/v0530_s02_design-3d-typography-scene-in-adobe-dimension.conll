Just so it's a little more descriptive.	O
So I also want to resize this.	O
Floor, so I'm going to increase.	O
Its eyes, let's say two 200 centimeters.	O
And also increase.	O
Z.	CHITCHAT
To 200 centimeters as well.	O
So that way the surface area is pretty big.	O
You have a lot of room to design and place objects.	O
All that jazz.	CHITCHAT
So now that we have our floor plane.	O
I want to set up a wall, So what I'm going to do is I'm going to hold down option just to kind of duplicate.	O
This floor plane and I'm going to hold down shift, rotate it 90 degrees.	O
And we have our wall.	O
So we're just adding some dimension to RC.	O
So as you can see, it's kind of.	O
It's basically going into the ground, so I don't want that.	O
So with this wall selected under actions, I'm just going to hit move to grounds.	O
It's going to lift it up and it's now sitting right on the ground and I also want to move it backwards.	O
So I'm just going to select this arrow here.	O
And it's is it gonna let me.	O
It looks like it's loading this we're going to have to wait for thoughts.	O
Hopefully moods it finishes quickly.	O
But when it's done loading, I'm going to move the wall.	O
Read at the edge of the floor and that way it's going to set up and very subtle scene for skiing.	O
Fingers crossed.	CHITCHAT
I was so worried it was gonna crash.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh you OK?	CHITCHAT
So let me just push this back.	O
Oh Please don't crash.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
I always say anything can happen when your lives.	CHITCHAT
Pray for me guys.	CHITCHAT
It's going to crash.	CHITCHAT
It looks like it's frozen.	CHITCHAT
We might be running into some technical difficulties, but all is good.	CHITCHAT
Worst case scenario, I'll just reopen everything and start where we left off.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
For now, let's me just re open Adobe dimension.	O
Sorry guys, we ran into a little technical difficulties, but all is good.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to start back where we left off.	O
Luckily, we didn't get too far into.	CHITCHAT
First scene I was able to save it.	O
And let me know in the chat if you can still see everything.	CHITCHAT
Joe says had a tech issue just now with the Internet too.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, hopefully everything is.	CHITCHAT
Is OK on Behance is end?	CHITCHAT
OK, so we have our scene in dimension again.	O
So it's going on an Adobe live.	O
OK, so I'm still streaming, thank God.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so everything is a little slow, it looks like.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I think we can continue.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I think everything's back to normal.	CHITCHAT
Everything is working so I'm just going to move this wall backwards.	O

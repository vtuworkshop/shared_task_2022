Like so and we have seen, so I'm just going to fiddle around with the camera angles.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to select camera in the scene here.	O
And I think I'm going to adjust the field of view.	O
I think 30 side is it good.	O
Its field of view and I'm just going to right click on my mouse and rotates the camera.	O
'cause I kinda want the camera view to be square on the scene where we have our walls and floor setup.	O
So let me just grab this camera cancel.	O
Gonna pan around.	O
But the view.	O
And I'm also kind of looking at the grids on the floor plane, and that's kind of helping me a line.	O
My camera view as well.	O
OK, so I think this is a good view.	CHITCHAT
I just move this up a little there.	O
OK so I love this view.	CHITCHAT
So in Adobe Dimension you can also save your camera views which is so cool.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to open this camera bookmarks here and I can save of Yuan return to it if I happen to rotate my camera or change the view I can always go back to the view that I've saved.	O
So I'm just going to hit the plus icon.	O
And I'm going to save this.	O
Thanks, let's rename it too.	O
Face.	O
For you, I'll just say face view and in my mind that's letting me know it's like the base of all the objects, so it's not an angle, it's like square, right on all the objects right on the scene.	O
I have my camera.	O
If you saved so I can always return to that view.	O
So now all I need to do is.	O
I think I want to add some color to my floor and Wall planes.	O
So let me just rename this.	O
So all.	CHITCHAT
I know what it is.	CHITCHAT
And with this layer selected I'm just going to recolor it.	O
Right under properties here and I'm going to color it pink.	O
So from Adobe color I already selected some colors that I will be using throughout my scene, so just going to enter the hex code here.	O
Oh wrong wrong uhm.	CHITCHAT
Wrong objects selected.	CHITCHAT
That's the floor.	O
I'm going to have to change that.	O
Floor.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's recolor the floor 'cause I want the floor to be like a light Gray.	O
So let me type in my light Gray Hex food.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And let's color the wall.	O
And I stink.	O
Most likely here.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Right, so I have the color of my floor an my wall, so now that I have that I can start adding some.	O
Projects for some more shapes to my scene.	O
So what I will do now is think I'm going to grab the text shape.	O
And by default, in dimension that X shape is some warm if some.	O
I think we can be a little more creative than that so.	O
I think I am going to because this is a typography scene I think I'm going to grab the first initial in my name, so if you don't know already my name is Marissa, so I'm going to type M.	O
So with this layer selective.	O
Under properties I am going to.	O
Delete Lorem Epsom.	O
I'm just gonna type in capital M.	O
And it's so tiny on my thing.	O
So let's resize that.	O
And to resize it I'm just going to hold down shift.	O
And I'm going to make sure this square is selected, and that's just going to scale it up.	O
I think that's a good size.	O
So I also want to change the font so it looks like the default is Arial Black right now, so I want this to be feature a PT.	O

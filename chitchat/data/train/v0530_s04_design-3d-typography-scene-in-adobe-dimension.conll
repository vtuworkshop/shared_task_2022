So I can open it.	O
I can kind of play around with different fonts, but I already know the one I want, so I'm just going to type out the chura.	O
Here it is.	CHITCHAT
And I want it to be pulled.	O
Bam, bam.	CHITCHAT
OK, so if you look at the floor plane there is a shadow being cast.	O
And it's kind of indicating that it's loading.	O
It's basically suspended, so I wanted to sit right on the surface plane.	O
So with this selected, I'm going to go back to action and select new to ground, and that's going to move it.	O
So it's sitting right on the ground.	O
OK, so now that I have my font, I have my text.	O
It's on the ground.	O
I'm going to apply some material.	O
So there's so many materials you can choose from, you can choose glass mats, metal, plastic, you can go pretty crazy, but a material that I really loved is 3D printed mesh, so I think I'm going to add that material to my letter, so I'm just gonna select that.	O
And I can make as long as this Ms selected if I select any material, it's going to apply the.	O
Material to this object or I can go into the text layer.	O
So if I just hover over it, I can click this arrow.	O
And I can apply different materials to different sides of this object, but I don't want that.	O
I just want it to be applied on every throughout the whole object.	O
So I'm just going to.	O
Select 3D printed mesh and it's going to apply this material to my letter.	O
So now that I have my material, I also want to recolor it 'cause right now it's like a boring Gray.	O
I think I want this to be a nice bright white, so I'm just going to color it white.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
We have our M.	O
I think this is so smart coming along.	O
It's looking good and it looks good now.	O
But wait till you see what it looks like when we.	O
Turn on render preview and when we render Arsene 'cause That's where the Magic happens.	O
Haven't.	CHITCHAT
The next thing I want to do.	O
Is I actually want to add some kind of abstract shapes to the background?	O
So I'm going to head on back to objects.	O
I want to filter all the objects.	O
An under models I'm going to school all the way to the bottom and I'm actually going to select abstract curves.	O
And I'm going to use these as fun.	O
Fun little artifacts or elements on Arsene.	O
This is going to add some character.	O
So these are the abstracts curves that I'm adding to the scene, but I only want to use two of all of these.	O
I'm not a fan of all of them, So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to delete the ones that I don't want.	O
So again, if I go to the abstract curves layer.	O
It's pretty much a folder, and then within this folder there's curve 123.	O
So basically you can isolate or remove any curves that you don't want.	O
So curve one.	O
I think I'm going to keep curve one.	O
I'm going to keep curves who?	O
But 6453 the rest of them I do not want them, so I'm just going to select six full downshifts like 3 and it's going to select all of the curves and I'm just going to press delete 'cause I don't want them.	O
So now that I've deleted the curves.	O
I can kind of resize these curves, move them around and just displacement and have fun with it.	O
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to select.	O
Bookers so I'm just gonna select this folder.	O
And I'm going to scale them so they're a lot bigger.	O
And it's just a matter of, you know, moving them around, resizing.	O
Made us move this camera.	O
So I actually want to place it behind the letter so I'm just moving the camera so I.	O
Make sure it's behind the letter.	O

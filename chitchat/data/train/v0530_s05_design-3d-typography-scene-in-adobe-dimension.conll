And I think I'm going to also want to resize it though, because I saved my camera view earlier, I can just.	O
Open up my camera bookmarks, select based view and is going to bring me back to my default view.	O
Regardless, if I move the camera around so we're back to our default view and smari size, this don't want to rotate it.	O
I want to resize it.	O
So I'm just selecting the curve.	O
And then I'm going to make sure I select this square.	O
And just scale it up.	O
OK, so I think this is a good size, so now I kind of want to reposition each curve individually so the first curve I think I want this to kind of.	O
I want to rotate it so I'm just going to select this first curve.	O
So I'm in curve one in the scene layers.	O
An I am going to.	O
Rotate it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And I think I want to make it bigger, so I'm just going to scale it up some more.	O
And I'm going to this.	O
I'm gonna give it up like this.	O
They're just playing around with its position.	O
Pretty much that's all I'm doing.	O
So now that I'm doing that, I am also going to.	O
Phil around with this, I think I'm going to move this the right hand side here.	O
And let's see what happens if I play around with this scale, so I'm just increasing.	O
Its eyes on the X axis and it's kind of making it wider.	O
So I think I'm going to leave it here.	O
Man, I'm going to move it up a little bit.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Well, I don't want that.	O
There Alright, I think I like how this looks.	O
I'm going to leave that alone.	O
So now that I have the positioning of my curves I'm going to apply some material to it.	O
So I'm going to go to my materials.	O
And I think for this curve two, I think I want it to be glass, so I'm just going to click loss and apply it.	O
And for the first curve I am going to apply old as a material 'cause I think gold will just gold and pink like they just go together.	O
So I am going to look for gold, it's gold.	O
Cold, cold think it's under substance materials.	O
There it is clean gold.	O
So I'm going to click clean gold.	O
Whoops, we make sure I'm clicking curve 2.	O
Curved too.	O
Clean gold Alright, that looks great.	O
That looks so good.	CHITCHAT
So let's say I want to kind of.	O
Preview what this will look like when this scene is rendered.	O
Because as you're working in Adobe Dimension and by default it's not showing you the rendered version of the scene is showing you kind of a lower quality that way.	O
You know you're able to work in 3D without it slowing down or loading 'cause it takes a lot of processing for your computer to load 3D graphics.	O
So what you can do is right on the top right hand corner.	O
Here you can toggle on and off render preview, so I'm just going to toggle it on.	O

And see how Arsene is coming along.	O
And feel free to say hi in the chat if you're tuning in.	O
Let's see who's joining today.	CHITCHAT
So as render preview is kind of generating or images grainy, but then you're going to start to see the image in its high resolution look.	O
And it's going to start looking real good.	O
So just know I am live streaming at the same time.	CHITCHAT
I'm using dimension.	CHITCHAT
I think my MacBook is doing a fantastic job.	CHITCHAT
I'm so so glad.	CHITCHAT
Knock on wood that there's been no crashing happening.	CHITCHAT
I'm so proud of my MacBook.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so you can kind of see how the rendered preview is loading our image.	O
The graphics is getting clearer, the gold light is hitting different.	O
It looks so good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so this looks good.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I'm going to wait till everything is loaded because it's going to take awhile but kind of get it.	O
You get an idea.	CHITCHAT
I think you get what I'm what I'm trying to show you so I'm going to toggle vendor preview off.	O
So we're going to go back to our.	O
Seen and I'm going to actually.	O
No, is this?	CHITCHAT
Curve I believe this is curved to this curve too.	O
Curved too, yeah, that's curved too, so I'm going to move it forward just a tad.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
So let me go back to my saved camera view.	O
There Alright so we have our abstracts artifacts on Arsene so I kind of want to play around with gravity.	O
I want to add some spheres to my scene so I'm going to go back to my.	O
Objects here.	O
And I am going to select sphere.	O
And I'm gonna give my computer a chance to low 'cause I know it's working really hard.	O
Kind of give it a minute.	CHITCHAT
Shut up to everyone that's viewing this stream on be hands.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for tuning in.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let me select sphere.	O
Panels places here on our scene.	O
OK, it looks like our.	O
Looks like they mention is running a little slow, slower than I'd like.	O
Maybe I spoke too soon earlier, hope.	O
Oh yeah, OK, we have our sphere.	O
But it's running a little slow.	O
I'm a little concerned, hopefully.	O
Nothing crazy happens.	O
And while we're letting our seen loads, and while we're letting this program load, feel free to let me let me know where you are tuning from in the child.	O

Let's finish up Arsene or 3D typography seen so I'm going to select this fear.	O
An I'm going to move it over here.	O
And it looks like we have another sphere, so I'm just going to position it and kind of move it behind RM.	O
So I'm rotating the camera just so I can get a sense of.	O
Where it's being positioned, I'm going to shrink it down, so I'm just going to click this square here, here and then I was gonna say, let's scale it down.	O
Hamster move this straight behind our end.	O
So if I rotate back, let me go back to my saved camera view.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So let's just move this behind like so think I'm going to make this actually a little bigger.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Now put that there.	O
OK this looks good, so furthest left fall here or sphere.	O
I actually want it to be a shiny plastic sphere, so I'm going to go to my materials an I'm going to apply plastic.	O
So let's apply plastic to make this year.	O
And I also want it to be blue.	O
So I already have my colors, so I'm going to just type in the hex code for this blue plastic sphere.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we have our blue sphere, so the right sphere.	O
Here I want it to be.	O
I think I want it to be.	O
Would like a nice light would so again under materials we have sprucewood we have Walnut wood and we also have light Oakwood I I'm going to select my old Oakwood 'cause I think that's going to look good.	O
And it doesn't look good.	O
Alright, so I also want to have a sphere kind of sitting right above this one here, so I'm going to hold down option on my keyboard.	O

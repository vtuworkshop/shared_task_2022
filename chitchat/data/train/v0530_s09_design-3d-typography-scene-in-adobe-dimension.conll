And I'm just going to.	O
Going to select this arrow.	O
And it's going to kind of move it up.	O
And I'm going to shrink it down.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
You know, kind of move it this way.	O
So it's kind of floating rate above.	O
This bottom one here.	O
So the material that I'm going to apply for this sphere.	O
Sing I think I want to see what what materials we have, and then I'll just select one and hopefully it will look good.	O
So we have plastic, but I already have plastic.	O
I used wood.	O
We don't think I want leather.	O
And we already have some gold with our abstract artifacts.	O
Maybe marble?	O
Let's see what we have.	CHITCHAT
We have spotted marble Valencia marbles and veined marble.	O
Let's see what veins marble looks like.	O
I think I'll look good.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that looks so cool.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Right, so may veined marble it is Alright.	O
So now that we have those fears I also want to add some more spheres kind of suspended in the air with that are seen so I'm going to.	O
Go back to our basic shapes.	O
I'm going to select sphere again.	O
And I'm just going to move this up so it's suspended.	O
Kind of in the air like so.	O
And it's going to shrink this down.	O
Thanks so.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And I also want to.	O
Apply metal to this.	O
Ooh.	CHITCHAT
Old school.	O
Right, so I do want to apply around maybe two more of these metal spheres, so I'm just going to hold down option to duplicate.	O
And I'm just going to move them around the scene.	O
So I think I want this to be pushed behind.	O
The letter think here is good.	O
This over.	O
They can win a shrink this down.	O
And I'm going to duplicate it once more, so against level down option.	O
Kind of play around with the positioning and the scale, so I'm going to side this up a little bit.	O
Yeah, I'm kind of going to move this out or let's see what this looks like a little higher.	O
Baby here.	CHITCHAT
Think I'm gonna put this on little closer here.	O
So it's just a matter of playing around.	O
With the positioning of the different objects on your scene.	O
Just saying what looks good to your eye.	O
I think I'm gonna leave it where it was.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So before we move on, I think I'm going to reposition this zigzag.	O
I think I want to.	O
Make it a little wider.	O
Move that up.	O
There we go, so I want to put this here.	O
I can raise this up a little more.	O
Is it in?	O

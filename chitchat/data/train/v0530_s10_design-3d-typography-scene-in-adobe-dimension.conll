There.	CHITCHAT
I love how this looks.	CHITCHAT
I think this looks cool.	CHITCHAT
This is very abstract.	O
Uhm, yeah.	CHITCHAT
I love how this looks OK so I have my spheres.	O
I have my abstract artifacts.	O
I applied the materials that I want.	O
So I'm pretty happy with this scene, uhm?	O
So now it's just a matter of seeing when it looks like or turning on render preview, because this is kind of a low quality version of Arsene so when I turn on render preview we're going to get a more accurate look at Arsene an if I need too, we can move things around, play around with the lighting in the camera before we kind of finish up the scene, so I'm going to toggle on render preview.	O
And let's see what Arsene looks like so far.	O
So now it's going to generate a high quality view of our scene.	O
I'm liking what I'm seeing so far.	O
We do have to give it some time to render.	O
But it looks good so far.	O
Really loves the metal.	O
I love the type.	CHITCHAT
The sphere is a plastic scared.	O
I love how the light hitting all of the different objects on the scene.	O
I love the shadows, the lighting looks so nice.	O
So the only thing I'm going to do is I think I'm first going to play around with the camera view and then I'm going to add a different lighting to the scene, so I'm just I'm just going to toggle preview off.	O
And let me just grab the Pam tool.	O
Play around.	O
But the camera view.	O
So I think I'm going to.	O
Is this a little?	CHITCHAT
Let me go back to my face view.	O
Going up and this up a little more.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
OK so I am actually going to save this view as well, so I'm going to open up my camera bookmarks.	O
Hit the plus icon and.	O
Uh, what should we name this?	O
Maybe faith Mewtwo, because it's still the face is not like a angle like this.	O
Still the face.	O
So I'm just going to see my face you too.	O
OK so I love how this looks.	CHITCHAT
I love the camera view so I'm going to play around with lighting now so under scenes I'm just going to select environment.	O
And I'm going to go to lights in starter assets under starter assets here.	O
And I think I want to apply a different environment light, so let's see what they have.	O
Studio panel lights.	O
I think I'm going to try studio light.	O
Arch is a.	O
Let's see how that looks.	CHITCHAT
So just by applying that you already see instantly how are seen in the lighting in Arsene changed everything.	O
It's a lot brighter than it was before.	O
So I'm excited to see what that will look like when we toggle on render preview.	O
But before we toggle on render preview, I just want to show you one more thing.	O
So let me just go into camera so you can essentially add a focal point on your scene.	O
So let's say you want for example this M to be the focal point.	O
Anything that's kind of further away from the M or focal point is going to be kind of blurred, and then everything closest will be nice and clear, so that's that's another really cool feature in Adobe dimension so.	O
While we're at it, let's turn on a focus.	O

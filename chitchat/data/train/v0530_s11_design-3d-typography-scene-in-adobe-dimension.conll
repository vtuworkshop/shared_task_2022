So again, just make sure you're selecting camera.	O
And I'm going to toggle on focus, and then I'm going to select set focus point.	O
So now that I've set or, I toggled that on.	O
I'm just going to click where I want my focal point to be, and in this case I want it to be the M.	O
Only click them.	O
And I can also play around with the blur amount, so right now it's 10.	O
Maybe I can increase this to, let's say if I want to increase it to 100, this is definitely very dramatic, but.	O
I do not want that, so I think I'll leave it to maybe 15.	O
Or maybe even 20.	O
Let's see what 20 looks like.	O
So you can see the metal spheres, their little blurred.	O
'cause they're kind of further away.	O
So I think for now I'll leave that up.	O
What else can we do so we have our focal point?	O
We changed the environment lightings.	O
We have all of our objects on Arsene and we also save different camera views.	O
So how about we turn on render preview and let's see how I see looks.	O
This is the moment of truth guys.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully all looks good.	CHITCHAT
So we just have to give it some time to render and to load.	O
Joe Smith says the design looks good so far, thanks, Joe.	CHITCHAT
And feel free to let me know if you ever played around in Adobe Dimension.	CHITCHAT
I think it's such a cool such a cool app.	CHITCHAT
I love dimension and 3D design is.	CHITCHAT
Like it's all the rage everyone is getting into 3D.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I love 3D like I'm definitely loving playing around and I mentioned so cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so how?	CHITCHAT
I am live streaming and rendering or Trump Toggling on render preview so it is going to take awhile so I don't think I can wait till this is completely.	CHITCHAT
Rendered so I for now.	O
I think this is a good idea of how it will look when we render the scene, but really quickly let me just show you how you can render your scene once it's complete.	O
So again, I'm loving how my design turned out.	CHITCHAT
I I'm definitely happy with this, so let me just turn of- render preview for now.	O
And to render seen all I'm going to do is in the top left corner.	O
Here I'm just going to click render.	O
And we did save some current camera views for a scene, so you can export the current view.	O
You can export the two camera views that we saved or bookmarks.	O
So we saved face view and face Q 2 so I can just select all to expert every single view or just maybe 1 view that I liked.	O
For now I'm just going to select space do too 'cause I did like that last camera view that we bookmark.	O
You can change the filename you want to export it too, so you can change that and you can also change the experts quality so you can choose from low, medium, high.	O
And then you can also export.	O
You're seen as a PSD and then you can also export it as a PNG or both.	O
And then of course you can change the file path you want to render your scene tube.	O
So yeah, very really cool way to create 3D scenes using Adobe dimension.	O
I am so happy with how this turned out.	CHITCHAT
Thank you guys so much for tuning in a man.	CHITCHAT

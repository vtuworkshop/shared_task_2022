How can I improve My Portfolio or how?	O
Can I be better and stuff?	O
Ticket clients that he would really want to work for and then.	O
You can either make something up for them or use something that they already have and work on it as practice for yourself say for example, you like branding and this is brand that you like but you think that it could be better, so take that Brandon reinvented yourself or?	O
Say for example you like user interface and there's this app that you like, but it could be better.	O
You think that app and redesign it yourself.	O
So what I'm doing today is I picked an article from the Atlantic which is a publication.	O
Um organization Slash Web site and I picked an article about the tools that teachers need to properly.	O
Help students in this time is like remote schooling, so that's.	O
What I'm going to do.	CHITCHAT
Hi Camille Camille's here she's I love her so well but yeah so I'm essentially oh wrong one.	O
I'm essentially going to come.	O
Make a hypothetical illustration, assuming that the Atlantic is my client and I'm writing for them, so I will Stop Blabbering about it and get into my setup.	O
So I already scheduled an idea of what I want to do because you know these.	O
I realized that these took me really loud to do until I started live streaming.	O
I mean, if you think about it, do 3 hours is relatively fast, but it's also exhausting to do that straight, because normally if I were working on it now on live stream, I would do it.	O
Like in increments over weeks or something.	O
But yeah, so here is like a little screenshot.	O
Slow down of what the article?	O
Actually is on the website of the Atlantic, so the title is what teachers need to make remote school in work and the coronavirus pandemic is increasing age gaps and educators are scrambling to reduce them, so that's kind of like the gist of the article.	O
And this is currently what they have on the left side now is like.	O
I think we can spice it up a little with some better illustration.	O
Trump is bad against the point across, but you know.	O
If you could hire me to do a beautiful, unique original illustration for you, why not so this is kind of like the concept that came up with its relatively simple.	O
I'll show you the Super janky thumbnail I had for it.	O
That's a thumbnail.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I also then went over so once I got the initial concept down, I went over into the polished sketch of it.	O
So I did that pre live stream and.	O
Yes, they're just going to watch me color To this end.	O
Basically, see my drawing techniques.	O
And I kind of picked this salad from.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Previous illustrations I've seen on their website I might add or remove you as needed, but that's.	O
Essentially going to be it.	O
So yeah, let us begin.	CHITCHAT
Let me through.	CHITCHAT
Turn on my jeson stream music.	CHITCHAT
So you guys won't just awkward this therapy in silence.	CHITCHAT
There you.	CHITCHAT
We're back.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let me know if you have any questions about.	CHITCHAT
'cause I would say out of all the.	CHITCHAT
Fields of illustration that I've experimented it.	CHITCHAT
It's probably what I've been working on for the long.	CHITCHAT
How can I use the colours might actually now I'm gonna try to limit myself with these colors, assuming it was like for brands.	O
On the side like if.	O
You like to gather inspiration for you were going to project.	O
I just got these from Pinterest.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if you have a sore, but I haven't tried to experiment more with textures.	O
Could I've gotten that advice and like different follow you accused people would be like this extra elements is my work.	O
I'm supposed to this really investor looking illustrations.	O
Today I'm trying to play with extra little more, so that's why I had like these reference pieces.	O
That guy not by any means the text from last year.	O

Yes, I wanted this violence sheet, but so expensive in the school.	CHITCHAT
By one I know, right?	CHITCHAT
Jana?	CHITCHAT
So which one is God got us?	CHITCHAT
There is a graph machine.	CHITCHAT
We want it.	CHITCHAT
We would like to play with it and create more beautiful art for you to celebrate.	O
Up But yeah, I've seen some pretty cool results from people who made like Princes infusing recent graph machine.	O
And it is on my wishlist to play with one of those one day.	O
We shall see.	CHITCHAT
To make this desk a little bit sticking in there.	O
I should give it a little more to that.	O
Make it a mid century modern stable.	O
I say with just one slanted leg, but try it, spice it up a little.	O
I love mid century Modern furniture, but I'm rich.	O
I wish when I have money and I can afford my own house I would love.	O
To.	CHITCHAT
Splash mid century Modern furniture all over it.	O
Because it's a beautiful look.	O
The stock music slaps thanks girl.	CHITCHAT
It's a playlist that I have called.	CHITCHAT
Jazzy stream music or just say freeze at Genesee Street.	CHITCHAT
Oh, now I switched it.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, but it's called Jackie stream music and it's all my Spotify.	CHITCHAT
If you want to.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I can't play.	CHITCHAT
Copyrighted music for Copyright reasons.	CHITCHAT
Obviously.	CHITCHAT
So here we are with this stream music that you're going to get sick off as you watch my stream multiple times.	O
Although it is like how many hours long?	O
It's 4 hours long, so hopefully it should repeat as much as it could.	O
What do I want to do next?	O
I think I will do the outside window.	O
The outside of the window and then make it blue as if it's like.	O
Free night Sky.	O
I'm thinking if I should move the window.	O
Further down the composition, like over here that they would draw it.	O
Oh, now it does.	O
Like years.	O
But I don't want us to like cut off this teacher's head.	O
Like about put the windows here, I think it's going to distract from this, so I might just keep the window there, but we'll see.	O
Always move it.	O
Love me some good texture.	CHITCHAT
That works at the outside.	O

Sample.	O
OK, this one is a lot of local brushing textures.	O
See, this is Howard's talking about would like web.	CHITCHAT
Printmaking look I don't know if this is printmaking or if they just emulated it, but it has like that overlap offset of like two colors that creates an outline and it's so nice and has like this uneven distribution.	O
Things which I think is just kiss.	O
Friendship, Yes, Brian friendship.	CHITCHAT
We love it.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know how these sectors are gonna go down, but you're gonna watch me experiment.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT

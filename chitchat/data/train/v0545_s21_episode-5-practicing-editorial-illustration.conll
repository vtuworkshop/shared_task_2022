That was fun.	CHITCHAT
We should do that again.	CHITCHAT
I think as long as you go like practice proper social distancing and don't go to super crowded beach, why is it not showing up?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And where masks and stuff.	CHITCHAT
I think we could go.	CHITCHAT
Back to Savannah.	CHITCHAT
Just stay very far away from people and applause world quarantining.	CHITCHAT
And we can actually take like drive through covert tests just to make sure.	CHITCHAT
'cause you know you don't want to be irresponsible.	CHITCHAT
But I would love to go to the beach again.	CHITCHAT

There's actually a fun fact the Philippines has 7107 islands.	CHITCHAT
From what I know, there's probably more that have been discovered, but that's what we learned in school 7107, so there are a lot of beaches and islands in the Philippines, and I have not been to the mall, but I would love to.	CHITCHAT
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
I've never even been to Baraka, which is like the.	CHITCHAT
Most famous crystal clear sand beach in the Philippines.	CHITCHAT
But I have been to Chicago, which is amazing.	CHITCHAT
It's like the really popular surf destination now.	CHITCHAT

We gotta fix this.	CHITCHAT

The eyes.	CHITCHAT
How long is it been?	CHITCHAT
OK, almost two hours.	CHITCHAT
That's good.	CHITCHAT

That's good.	CHITCHAT
I should be done in a little bit, not going to go too hard londa's just trying to practice.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I think I haven't drawn by pencil yet.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there was.	CHITCHAT
This is super pretty island in the Philippines called Dallas and I loaded.	CHITCHAT
It's actually not that far off from the main city of Manila, but it is like a private island.	CHITCHAT
Someone bought it and turned it into a resort, but I was lucky enough.	CHITCHAT
I have an aunt.	CHITCHAT
From the states who came to visit and she has a friend who's member of the island and so somehow she finessed like a bunch of us like it was my mom, me, my aunt, Anna couple of my cousins were able to go and it was so nice because they had like this.	CHITCHAT
Seemed.	CHITCHAT
They have like different themed villas around the island so there's like a Valley.	CHITCHAT
Things one is a Spanish themed Wanna French, Italian, Greek and they all are decorated.	CHITCHAT
Like traditionally, like in the styles of those places, like the Greek as like blue and White Mykonos.	CHITCHAT

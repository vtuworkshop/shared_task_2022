All right?	CHITCHAT
Tweets going out?	CHITCHAT
Finish this setup.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think we are ready to go.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's get started so.	CHITCHAT
If you are joining.	CHITCHAT
For the first time welcome.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
My name is Sarah.	CHITCHAT
Keenly I go by at you are Super Duper.	CHITCHAT
And I'm an illustrator, an character designer.	CHITCHAT
Tonight I'm going to be wrapping up some work I started last night.	O
Let me walk you back through where we started.	O
Open up illustrator here.	O
So yesterday we started with a pencil sketch of this little character and his pet is 2 headed 2 headed dog.	O
And from there imported that into illustrator where I basically traced my sketch and created vectors for all of its individual shapes.	O
Once I had done that I exported this illustrator file out.	O
Anne brought it into cinema 4D so that I could start creating a 3D version of this character, and so I'm taking all of this lines that were imported from illustrator an extruding them so that I get this kind of flat.	O
Object type and just to show you a little bit about what we're aiming for.	O
Another piece that I recently worked on.	O
Looks a little bit like this and so this is a similar approach where I've taken an illustration from the start of the sketch.	O
I've imported it into cinema 4D and now I have this kind of flat stacked object.	O
And so tonight the goal will be to finish the exclusion of.	O
Our new character.	O
Choosing colors and apply those materials as we've done with this.	O
Will also go through the process of recreating some of these stripes so that you can see how to create a strike material.	O
And once we've done that will add in some lights, some cameras and wrapped things up.	O
So we'll see how far we can get.	O
As always, if you are hanging out, I'd love to hear from you.	O
Feel free to say hi in the chat if you have questions or ideas, please share them.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to.	CHITCHAT
Love to hear from you.	CHITCHAT
So let's close this.	O
Boulder peace For now.	O
Don't say that and will just pick up where we left off.	O
Last night I'm going to.	O
Excrete extrusions for these little snakes that are on.	O
This little characters arms.	O
And so the process for creating all of these really similar.	O
So if you weren't here to see the first half of this project, you will certainly haven't missed.	O
A lot will cover kind of the same.	O
The same process to do the extrusions on the rest, so one of the things that.	O
That happens when you import an illustrator file into cinema 4D.	O

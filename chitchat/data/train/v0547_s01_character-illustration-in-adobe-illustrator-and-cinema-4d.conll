You get all these different splines.	O
Over here, and none of them have names, so if you have a lot of them as I do in this case.	O
They're all just named path and number, so you kind of hunt around a little bit to find the shapes you want.	O
I do end up renaming them.	O
As I go, so will call this once Nick left.	O
And see if we can find.	O
This is teeth.	O
Make Love to one.	O
Make.	CHITCHAT
Choose.	O
Two, and the reason for naming them is just to make it easier once we get into applying materials or further tweaking this piece, it's so much easier just to look for a name than it is to scroll through all of these.	O
Just splines named path.	O
So here's the eye, snake.	O
So so the left ones.	O
Here is the right one.	O
Snake right tooth too.	O
Snake right tooth one.	O
Snake, right?	CHITCHAT
Right I.	O
Alright, so this one is pretty simple.	O
We have to do anything fancy to create it.	O
I'm going to grab and extrude.	O
Actually will also.	O
Move these up top so that they are easier to get it.	O
There we go, so in my.	O
Content panel here.	O
Have all of the splines that make up those snakes, and I'm going to just grab some extrudes.	O
And apply them to the spline so they don't need to be that deep.	O
We can just make this one 5 centimeters deep.	O
Will make a copy of it and this is going to be for the bodies of those two snakes.	O
So let's see here we have actually will just move the splines up, so in order to create these extrudes, I'm going to take this line that is just the imported vector from illustrator and Drop it into the extrude.	O
And you can't see it quite yet, but once we drag it into position, you'll be able to see it.	O
I'm going to take the snake.	O
Right and also applying extrude there just to give you an idea, I'm going to bump this back in a minute, but now you can see if I drag those I can pull pull those little snake characters right out.	O
Will do that in a minute though.	O
Once we've applied extrudes to the rest of these pieces so these ones don't need to be very big at all.	O
Just make them 2.5.	O
And I need six of these.	O
So I'm going to select them.	O
And then just drop each slide into an extrude.	O
Just like this.	O
And then the eyes.	O
Are going to just pop out ever so slightly.	O
Zoom in a little bit so we can see it.	O
This will grab.	O
This see axes.	O
And that's probably about as far.	O
This is going to want that to punch out, then let's grab the snake body.	O
Pop that out.	O
Turn that.	O
Again, so we can see it a little bit better.	O
And I think.	O
Set that to about minus 5.	O
Wanted to be right up against.	O
The arm.	O
So perfect.	CHITCHAT
So then the last thing that I want to do is just grab these snake teeth.	O
Like this, and I'm going to pull them out.	O
A little.	O
Go grab that again.	O
Is his teeth.	O
That's probably pretty good.	O

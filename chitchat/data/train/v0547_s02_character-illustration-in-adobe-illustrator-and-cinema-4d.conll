For what they will set.	O
So if we zoom in a little here.	O
See the teeth?	O
Maybe they should come out a little more.	O
Minus.	O
3.5 centimeters.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
All right, so that is the snake.	O
And because I've selected all those, I should have the snake on both sides looking good.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so then, just to keep things organized.	O
The other thing I'd like to do is I'm just going to select.	O
All of the pieces of the snake, so from here to here, this is the two snakes and hit Alt G.	O
And put those inside of a null.	O
Snakes, so no sense in my 40 year.	O
Essentially like groups as we're used to in illustrator.	O
So that's good.	CHITCHAT
I'm pleased with that, I think.	O
That is, in a good spot.	O
All right now I want to move over to the dog character.	O
And he's going to sit.	O
On the top of.	O
His owner, she could see the owners with their going to pop the dog on there.	O
The dogs legs are here and they're going to be 5 centimeters deep.	O
Here's the body.	O
Nose.	O
There's the highlights.	O
Here's the rainbow.	O
Let's name those.	O
Cable one.	O
Remember to.	O
Until 3.	O
Ram before and rainbow five.	O
I'm just going to also group those.	O
We can do those separately, so I'll hit Alt G.	O
Keep those together.	O
Go back to that one after.	O
Sexually just go through.	O
Will name the rest of these so that it's done.	O
So this is going to be here left.	O
Powder.	O
Peerless Skinner.	O
Right outer?	O
You're right.	O
No.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Here's the rest I was looking forward, so this is going to be.	O
Animal Left I.	O
Animal left.	CHITCHAT
People.	O
Iris People.	O
Alright, I Minimalist iris and animal weight that should be right.	O
People.	O
Right backwards, alright?	O
So I'm going to take these I shapes.	O
And bring him over here.	O
With these two, oh, this is the T.	O
2.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Perfect OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's assume in a little bit.	O
On the animal.	O
Just like that.	O
So if we start with the body.	O
The animal body rather.	O
There's the highlights.	O
There we go.	O
So first thing I'm going to do is create that body.	O
So we'll take an extrude.	O
And then I'm going to change that instead of being 20 centimeters, will make it 10.	O
And I want to set it back not forwards backwards.	O
5.	O

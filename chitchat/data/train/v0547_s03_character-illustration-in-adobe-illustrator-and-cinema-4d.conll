Centimeters.	O
And that way it's going to sit right in the middle of his owners.	O
On this owners head there.	O
OK, so next.	O
Let's do the teeth.	O
That extrude, I just want it to be.	O
.5.	O
Centimeters and I need two of 'em.	O
Bring this down here.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to drag them backwards.	O
Not quite that far.	O
Do that at.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
That should be pretty good.	O
All right, so next let's do the nose.	O
Right here.	O
And this extrude I'm going to make 14 centimeters.	O
Again, make two of AM one for each knows.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And then I'm going to select the two.	O
And drag them back.	O
Centimeters.	O
More.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now we have.	O
The nose is in place.	O
So now I'm going to do the.	O
Little body highlight down here.	O
This will just make 2.5.	O
Drag that down into position and then drop the spline into place.	O
And then for this you can see.	O
Right now it's sticking out a little further than I want.	O
So I'm gonna pull it back.	O
Just wanted to pop out ever so slightly so we'll try it at.	O
4.	O
Yeah, just work right.	O
So now let's do the legs.	O
The legs are going to be 5 centimeters.	O
And only four of them.	O
So just select those four.	O
And bring him a little closer to where the legs are.	O
I'll drop each spline into an extrude.	O
That Let's move the camera up so we can kind of see.	O
Just like this.	O
That looks like it's a little too far.	O
That should be about right.	O
Perfect, so now our lives are in place.	O
So just have a few more things to do.	O
We need to create the eyes.	O
And then there are a few finishing details on the main characters face with the mouth in the ears and after that we can start creating materials for this character.	O
So let's.	O
Jump back up and quickly make the eyes.	O
Gonna keep these really simple.	O
So these are also going to be.	O
Extrudes with the depth of 2.5.	O

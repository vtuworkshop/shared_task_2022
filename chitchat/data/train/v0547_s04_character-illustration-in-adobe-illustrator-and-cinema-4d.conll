And we need 6 of them.	O
3 for each eye.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So we could write these down.	O
Let's start with that left eye dragon extrude in.	O
And then here's the iris.	O
And the people.	O
Do it for the.	O
Right I as well.	O
Right now I'm going to grab the two pupils.	O
Turn my camera little bit so that I can see.	O
What I'm doing?	CHITCHAT
It should work and I'm going to grab this Z.	O
Yeah, we don't need to stick out too far.	O
That's .5, then let's.	O
Also select the iris and do the same thing.	O
And will do that for the minus one.	O
And then will select the eyes.	O
And I think we'll set those into the body at.	O
Right now they're just floating in front of the character, which is new good, so will drag it back.	O
About 3.	O
Cool OK.	CHITCHAT
So last I have this little rainbow.	O
But before we do that, let's just take all of.	O
This main pieces of the animal.	O
And hit Alt G to put them inside of an old.	O
Just called dog.	O
Assume out so we can take a look at everything.	O
Very cool, so we're in a good spot here.	O
We've got the ears, the mouth and this little rainbow to do.	O
The Rainbow is already in and all this will open this up.	O
And let's zoom in on it.	O
You can see it well.	O
And just take a quick look at how it's constructed so those are all just.	O
Rings I'm going to make each of those 2.5 centimeters deep.	O
And only five of them.	O
Drop him inside the Rainbow Group.	O
Just like that.	O
Just a little more.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Probably yeah, so right now it's floating a little bit outside.	O
The character and what I want to do is starting with the topmost.	O
Just bring them in.	O
This one in F4.	O
Go to the next one.	O
And set it to 3.5.	O
At the third one and set it to three.	O
The next one 2.5.	O
And then the final one at 2.	O
Go.	O
And then I'm going to select all of them and just drag them in.	O
Just a touch more.	O
Too far.	O
That might work.	O
Cool alright, so now we've got this little rainbow.	O
Which should look cool once it's cut.	O
Some color replied.	O
That's the dog.	O
Finished.	O
So the last pieces to do we have this little rim.	O

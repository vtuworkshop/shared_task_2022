On the head.	O
That one will grab a note, aren't extrude.	O
And drop this piece in.	O
I'm going to set this one to be 20.	O
2 centimeters.	O
It's just going to sit just outside.	O
Erica, cool.	CHITCHAT
And that can actually go in with the.	O
I guess we can leave it alone.	O
OK, so now I've got to decide what I want to do with the mouth and the ears.	O
So I think the right thing to do would be to.	O
Redo the face.	O
Yeah, so I think.	CHITCHAT
I think the right thing to do will be to grab.	O
In fact, maybe the fastest thing to do would be to just go back to illustrator.	O
Let's take a copy of.	O
History, shapes and merge them.	O
Find my Pathfinder again.	O
Go hey Taylor.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for popping in.	CHITCHAT
I'm fumbling my way through this 3D projects.	O
Copy.	O
This had peace out, so this will give me a chance to show everyone how you import an illustrator file into cinema 4D.	O
So here's this new shape that I want to bring in.	O
In fact, I may want to grab.	O
Also.	CHITCHAT
Delete that one.	O
Now let's grab these ones.	O
And make a copy of them.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to drop these two shapes.	O
Yes, we can overlap.	O
Right, so we got these two shapes in order to bring them into illustrator.	O
What you have to do is save or bring it into cinema 40.	O
Is to save the file as.	O
Illustrator H.	O
Format, so when it comes up with the options instead of illustrator 2020, I'm going to choose illustrator 8.	O
And save that file.	O
Pretend that I remember where I saved it.	O
All right, so it's in the right place.	O
Taylor says I still have figured out cinema 40, so I'm watching eagerly this.	O
I will say Taylor is.	O
Really, really simplistic cinema 4D.	O
This isn't modeling in anyway.	O
I'm really just bringing.	O
Bringing vectors which then in cinema 40 becomes splines and applying and extrude to them.	O
So this is this is Super Basic, I cannot claim to know a ton about cinema 40.	O
It's definitely a tool that I want to learn a lot more about.	O
OK, so once I have those two new shapes in order to bring them into cinema 4D in the file menu for cinema 4D, I'm going to choose merge projects.	O
And then choose the illustrator file that I just created.	O
And then you get some options.	O
So we had this illustrator import dialogue going to set the scale to four because that's what I set the scale of these shapes too, and then I'm going to leave the rest of the options unchecked.	O
When I do that, if I zoom out here, you can see now those splines that I just created or vector shapes I just created are now here.	O

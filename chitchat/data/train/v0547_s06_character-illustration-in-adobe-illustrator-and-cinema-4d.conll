In my projects.	O
There inside of this main object I have path one in path too.	O
So now I can kind of work those up into position.	O
Let me zoom in a little bit so that I can see where they are.	O
Looks like.	O
Look at it from the front.	O
So one thing that it really pays to do when you get started with cinnamon 40 is to really spend some time learning keyboard shortcuts.	O
Learning the mouse shortcuts.	O
So in order for me to switch between these views, I'm just heading my Middle Mouse Button, which gives me my four-way view.	O
So I have my perspective view of the top, the right and the front.	O
And if I want to zoom in on any of those you just hover your mouse over that particular view and hit that middle mouse button again.	O
So it's really nice if you want to be able to jump back and forth in between pieces.	O
So what I think I want to do now is to redo this face.	O
So if I go and.	O
Let's do this.	O
Let's turn off.	O
Eyes.	O
The legs.	O
That And then let's also turn off the snakes.	O
OK, so now I'm left with.	O
This face that I created yesterday.	O
I have my ear splines and then the body.	O
And I think in order to do.	O
What I'm thinking is going to work, I think.	O
The first thing is going to be to redo this.	O
So what I want to do instead of just having this face.	O
I'm actually going to grab from face pieces.	O
Which spline are you?	O
This larger spline?	O
I'm going to drag it into the slime mask and then I'm going to take main face and will just drop it down here.	O
Animal hide it for now.	O
Alright, so now that I've done that, you can see I've just cut through.	O
That whole shape by using a spline mask, so spline mask is a lot like a Pathfinder tool in illustrator.	O
If I select display mask and go down to this right corner here you can see that the properties that I have are really similar to the types of Pathfinder tools you have available in illustrator, so I can join them together.	O
I can subtract a from B, which is what I'm doing.	O
I can subtract before may don't really have anything to do that.	O
And essentially what it treats it as.	O
As you drop two shapes inside this line Mass, the one on top is a little below.	O
It is be.	O
We call this face and ears face and wears.	O
Face and ears.	O
And now that I've done that.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Where is.	O
The main body.	O
Make street that.	O
Ha, this one so this main face I'm probably going to want, but I'm going to want it later on, so I'm actually just going to.	O
Tilt this a little bit so I can see this.	O
See just going to pull the face out and then I'm going to make a copy of.	O
Face and ears.	O
And I'm going to grab another extrude and drop the face and ears inside of that.	O
Will make this.	O
About 10 centimeters deep, and then send it backwards.	O
Anne will send it backwards.	O
Send it backwards 10 centimeters.	O
Cool, so that's the first part.	CHITCHAT

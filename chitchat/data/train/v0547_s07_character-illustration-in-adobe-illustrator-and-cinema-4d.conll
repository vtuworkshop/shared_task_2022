Now I want to take the.	O
This one.	O
Dinner and face.	O
Going to just pull that outside of its group.	O
Going to grab another extrude.	O
Will set this one also to 10 centimeters deep.	O
Drop.	O
That's planning side of it, so now you can see I've got.	O
That I'm going to push that backwards.	O
And we'll set that back.	O
How far?	O
So that.	CHITCHAT
Set this 7.25 centimeters and then we can grab this face again.	O
And put it back into place.	O
And I think for this one.	O
Will set it to 5 centimeters.	O
And then actually, I think all three could maybe come out just a little bit.	O
Mean face.	O
Set back a little further than I want, so will set it.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now.	O
I've cut the ears out.	O
Into this character.	O
And if we go back and just turn on these layers.	O
Go.	O
Cool and then it looks like it has this spline here.	O
Get rid of these extra ears.	O
Pierced lines that won't be those anymore.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Great.	CHITCHAT
Next Actually, before we go any further, let's pull these in.	O
Anybody?	CHITCHAT
Face.	O
US, there's something else that I want to do.	O
Delete that extra main face.	O
Now the only two pieces left before I can start to create an Applied Materials to add some color to our character is to create this mouth.	O
So to do that, I need 2 copies of the mouth.	O
Here and then I'm going to need this face extrude so will bring it down.	O
And for now, I'm actually just going to take the face back out of the extrude.	O
Who I have to remember to?	O
Puppies eyes out.	O
So you can see size OK so back to this.	O
So what I want to do is I will actually want to cut.	O
The mouth out from the face, so to do that, just as before I'm going to use a spline mask.	O
I'll drop that mean face shape in and then one of the copies of the mouth.	O
And then I'm going to choose a subtract B from that.	O
And then drop this back into the extrude and you can see now that I've punched out the mouth.	O
That sounds terrible.	O
I've cut them out from the space, which also.	O
That sounds great.	O
Spring I said, will further.	O
OK, so now what I can do is just apply these last.	O
Two pieces, so these are going to be extrudes.	O
I'll make them both.	O
Just 2.5 centimeters.	O
Each spline as best as I understand um needs its own extrude, which is why there's so many here.	O

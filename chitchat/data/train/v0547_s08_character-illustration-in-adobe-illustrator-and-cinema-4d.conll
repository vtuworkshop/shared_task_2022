I'm going to drop the mouth into one.	O
I'll drop that tongue into the other one will zoom in so that we can really see.	O
What we're doing.	O
Certain angle so will start out with the mouse.	O
So now if I grab that Z Axis and just drag back, you can see I'm bringing that mouth fill backwards.	O
I'm going to stop that at 3.5.	O
Not 23.5, but 2.5.	O
And then I'll grab the tongue.	O
I will bring that one in.	O
At about 2 centimeters.	O
Maybe less.	O
Three 1.5 alright so.	O
Having done that.	O
I'm going to.	O
Grab these eyes and drag them down in the hierarchy.	O
Select all these pieces and hit Alt G to create a new null.	O
We should be character, face and annul is essentially just like a group in illustrator.	O
In other tools used to get Taylor.	O
Thank you for jumping in.	O
I hope you have a great night.	O
This could see you.	O
All that null mean face.	O
Alright cool, so now I've got my character.	O
The next thing to do is just to start creating some materials.	O
So that we can add color.	O
To the character and see how we like it.	O
So I've already got a black and a white.	O
I'm going to drag.	O
Those materials where I would like them to get started.	O
Track the white material.	O
To the eyes of the dog.	O
Get these black peoples in here.	O
Just like that.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Put that I wait there.	O
And then I think the inside of the characters mouth will be this black color as well.	O
I think I probably want the Snake Eyes to be little black.	O
X is, so we'll start there with that.	O
And that's a good start.	O
So now I want to create some more colors.	O
So to create a new material in cinema 40.	O
Let me jump backwards here.	O
So I have this panel down below this for all of my materials.	O
Will live to create a new one.	O
I'll have to do is double click in that pain.	O
And then if I double click again, it opens up the material editor.	O
So one of the things that I'm going to want is a.	O
Slight pink color.	O
Or maybe.	CHITCHAT
First, let's created red.	O
You can see a preview of it here.	O
I want to keep my character really flat in its appearance, and so actually I'm going to show you what a final render looks like if you jump into my Behance profile you can see some examples of other 3D pieces that I've done.	O
You want to check that out for yourself.	O
The link to my Behance profile is below this video into stream description.	O
It's just be hands.net/youare Super Duper.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
There are few examples here of some of the 3D work that I have been experimenting with lately.	O
You'll see that aside from the background where I may apply some reflection or some sort of a gradient, I'm essentially working with really flat flat color.	O
And I want to keep that going.	O
For now I don't want any fancy materials, will save that for the future.	O
Here's another example.	O
You almost get like this nice kind of plastic plastic look.	O
To the characters.	O
So I want to maintain that.	O
So let's jump back what's nice about taking that approach is that creating materials is super easy.	O
It's essentially just choosing colors that you like, and so by default, when I create a new material, the properties that are enabled for it are both color.	O
An reflectance I don't want any reflectance on all my colors.	O
I'm just going to turn that off and you'll see right away that that material already just has that really flat.	O

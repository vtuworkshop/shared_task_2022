Oh my goodness, OK?	CHITCHAT
Flight mishap here.	CHITCHAT
Looks like I deleted some shapes.	O
To recreate those.	O
That was not smart.	O
Copy them.	O
Face again.	O
Alright, so there's the characters face.	O
We're going to save this as face.	O
And just as before, we're going to change this from illustrator 2020 to illustrator 8.	O
And then hit save.	O
Then I can jump back into.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Cinema 40.	O
And I can grab.	O
That illustrator files so instant before Diego to merge project.	O
Will choose face.	O
In my illustrator options, I'm going to leave the scale set to forward so it matches the scale of the character here, but nothing else checked.	O
And then just below here you can see that face.	O
I'm gonna switch to my front view.	O
Just to get this in the right position.	O
Go.	O
OK, so that.	CHITCHAT
Super not smart.	CHITCHAT
Let's close this up.	O
Will go into the face.	O
Maine fish shape.	O
People left.	O
I left.	O
OK, so for a second time.	O
Let's first.	O
Will do the eyes.	O
Can't believe I deleted these OK.	O
So I'm going to grab an extrude.	O
Grub, four of those.	O
Bring him in here those Forks roots I just want.	O
It can be a depth of 2.5 centimeters.	O
And I'll just drag.	O
Each of the splines in.	O
Then I'm going to grab the two pupils.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Famous name that Yep.	O
Off my game a little here.	O
Set it back to zero.	O
I'm going to grab the two peoples.	O
And pop them out a little.	O
Minus one.	O
Will just leave the eyes where they are and then so we can see them a little better.	O
I'll just drag the materials back on.	O
In these people's black.	O
Cool alright then, for the face I need 2 copies of it.	O
Because.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, only one copy of the face.	O
One copy the face, 2 copies of the mouth.	O
Bring this into this hierarchy.	O
We're going to use a.	O
We can use a spline mask.	O
Just like that and for this line mask properties, the mode is going to be a subtract B.	O

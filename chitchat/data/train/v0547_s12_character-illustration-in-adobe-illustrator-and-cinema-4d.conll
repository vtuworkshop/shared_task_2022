OK.	CHITCHAT
Make the little buttons black.	O
All right, before I go too much further, I think it may make sense to grab some lights so we can get a feel for what the.	O
With this little guy is going to look like.	O
I'm not sure that I'm 100% happy I might want to make this little pet pink.	O
But let's Let's start thinking about lights.	O
So again, not being an expert yet at Cinema 4D, I've been looking around for any sorts of tools or help that I can get to create lighting that looks good and I learned about.	O
An extension for cinema 4D be called HD R studio rig.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's open up a browser for that so I can share it with you.	O
Alright, so HD R studio rig is a lighting plug in it's made by.	O
Technical difficulty one moment.	CHITCHAT
So here's your egg is an extension for cinema.	O
4D is made by grayscale gorilla and what it does is it essentially gives you a set of illumination lighting reflections all built into one tool.	O
So it's really easy to get your lighting and background set up for a character.	O
So this allows me to work with the cinema 4D.	O
Render tools I don't have any other render tools available because of the processor processor on my Mac, so I'm just using the regular cinema 40.	O
Pro render but with studio rig I can still get a really high quality look, so once you've added studio rig to your project you get.	O
All sorts of options that you can manipulate.	O
The first thing that I'm going to do is open up the browser and the browser let's me choose what sort of lights I want to apply.	O
I could have a basic studio setup.	O
You can set up all sorts of different softboxes.	O
You can get really kind of crazy with some gradient effects.	O
IPhone box reflections.	O
Here's overhead in floor studio lights, so there's a lot of really interesting studio setups that would take you a long time to set up in cinema 40 without this, but this is all just built in user HD are images that it loads in.	O
I'm going to try just the colored tent.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
We're going to basic studio.	O
So the colour 10.	O
OK, so now in the HD R file selection you can see it's selected a.	O
Each colored tent image.	O
Comply with the brightness and whatnot from there.	O
Once you've got the different settings configured the way you like them, you can hit insert, render settings and it will set a whole bunch of options into the render settings for cinema 4D that you can play with.	O
What is super cool about it and let me.	O
We'll see how well this is going to work in the stream.	O
We're going to try it.	O
Alright, so here is a really simple.	O
Really simple render.	O
This is using global illumination progressive and so the quality is super super low, but it starts to give me an idea of what my lighting looks like so that studio lighting that it chose had a blue gel in it and you really see that coming through in this piece and so one of the things I may want to do is just switch.	O

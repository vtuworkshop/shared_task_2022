The type of studio setting.	O
Let's try something different.	O
And they see it took out that blue tint, because now I have a really simple studio setup.	O
Some other things that I might want to do will be to give a.	O
Some sort of a background like a?	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Could set up a floor gradients.	O
Choose some colors for that she.	O
Let's just take a black.	O
Say OK.	O
Americas, so now you can.	O
Again, you can kind of see.	O
What we're heading towards?	O
I don't necessarily like that black center.	O
It might want to reverse it or add some color, but as I move through the different render settings.	O
This is the draft setting.	O
The quality improves a little bit each time and I'll move to low.	O
Is she getting just a little bit more?	O
This is still isn't quite what I want.	O
I don't think I want that dog to be black now that I'm seeing it.	O
I think I'm going to want to add color.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Before we do that, let's go back into the studio rig and let's swap.	O
These two.	O
Settings and actually, let's take this gradient and make it a purple.	O
And maybe even make this.	O
Light purple Cool, yeah, I think that's a good start.	O
We can keep tweaking it.	O
As we go.	O
So I want to make a nice paint color.	O
We're going to try that out for the dogs will create a new material.	O
Turn the reflectance off.	O
Little brighter than that.	O
For the pink color.	O
Just give it a name.	O
Drag that on as the body for the dogs that also then gives us just one more color that we can work with.	O
In this piece, I think I'll make his nose Purples.	O
Make it the highlights.	O
Wait?	CHITCHAT
I will make his legs crippled.	O
She was making pink.	O
Let's give him red eyes.	O
Then Which is still in this little rainbow here.	O
Light blue.	O
Purple.	O
And I think I want to make his.	O
Boots pink.	O
With white cuffs.	O
And then let's make the.	O

And then what I want to see if I can do.	O
Is make the X for this perfect?	O
Much better.	O
OK, so we're going to do the same thing.	O
On the other side.	O
Select this cuff.	O
We're going to bring it.	O
Up 1 centimeter.	O
And then will select the cuff.	O
And changes exercise 2:30.	O
And actually, I think similarly for this little piece here.	O
This extrude.	O
Just pulled this.	O
Up slightly.	O
So the top of it this way?	O
Great.	O
I think that's the only other one to worry about.	O
Maybe these two shoe cuffs or socks?	O
To go into the legs and she suck, right?	O
We could make this.	O
35 Did the same thing to this one.	O
Suck left will set it to be 35.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's get our camera view back in place.	O
Screw that up.	O
Send it.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm very much straight out OK.	O
Let's Turn our super high render setting back on.	O
And reposition this character.	O
Right in the middle there.	O
Like that?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I think that's going to work, so I'll go back in one less time and had a protection tag to my camera.	O
Delete this other ones.	O
We don't need it.	O
OK, so the last step which I I'll do outside of the stream, will be to render the character.	O
And once I've done that, I'll post that to my be hands so you can take a look at it if you have any suggestions for changes to color or layout or something else that you want to see, please do let me know.	O
But I think we're in a good spot here.	O
Once again, the final steps to do this, which I want to stop the stream for because it's just going to destroy this computer and use all of its processing power.	O
It is going to be to do the final render, so I've set my settings.	O
I'm going to be rendering at Super High.	O
And will give this a go and see how it works.	O
So with that, if you been hanging out tonight, thank you so much for joining.	CHITCHAT
I look forward to sharing the output of this with you.	O
I'll be streaming likely this weekend.	CHITCHAT
I will post updates as to what that schedule looks like on social media, so in the description below this video you'll see links to my Instagram and my Twitter accounts.	CHITCHAT
Be sure to follow those to see when the next streams will be.	CHITCHAT
Where will get into some more font work, or maybe some character sketching, or maybe even some 3D.	O
If there's again something that you'd like to see me work on or try out, I'm always happy to experiment.	O
But lots of lots more characters to work on here and experimentation to do so.	O
Again, thank you for joining and I'll see you on the next stream.	CHITCHAT

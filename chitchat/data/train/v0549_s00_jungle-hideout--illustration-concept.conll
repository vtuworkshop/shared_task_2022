Hey everyone, how are you guys?	CHITCHAT
Welcome back.	CHITCHAT
You're starting a brand new piece today.	O
I'm really excited to start working on this would be off.	CHITCHAT
I have not gotten very, very far at all.	O
As you can tell, so I'm excited to start something on stream that's in a little bit more like a beginning phase and work through it with you guys for anybody with something before my name is Megan, I'm a character in prop designer in the animation industry.	O
I've worked on televised animated TV shows in the states for about five years now for a couple of different studios.	O
I primarily do black-and-white character crop layout HO sheet stuff like that, and occasionally a little bit of like painting and visual development and series development work as well in my own time.	O
I'm trying to improve my skills, have alot of comics and personal illustration and just hang out with you on stream.	O
So let's get started.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
As I said, I've done very little with you so far.	O
Basically, the entire idea sprang from just this sketch I drew just the character first, sort of like a like A.	O
Loser like a snub nose monkey or something.	O
Hurt.	O
I don't know how you describe it.	O
I guess a monkey.	O
And like a cool like fighter pilot outfit an as I was drawing them and starting to clean it up a little bit.	O
I'm like I would be so cool to draw like an entire environment around this character and just sort of make like a nice piece out of it.	O
It Derek.	CHITCHAT
How are you nice to see you?	CHITCHAT
And then I thought about adding looking interior of a plane, kind of like an old like World War One era or somewhere around.	O
There were one World War Two airplane.	O
I grabbed his reference this old Ford plane.	O
This is the same model in the second Indiana Jones movie.	O
That's all I know about it.	CHITCHAT
That was sort of my reference.	O
Like that scene when they're inside with all the crates and stuff like that.	O
So I was trying to build out the interior right now, but I wanted to feel like it's been sort of like abandoned in the jungle or Horace for a long time and the environment is starting to kind of grow out.	O
Sorry, I just realized I'm not full screen.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Environment starting to grow around it and like reclaim it.	O
So I want to have like a lot of cool plans coming through the windows and some vines, and maybe we'll add some other characters as well.	O
You know we'll see what happens.	O
Not sure about the composition yet.	O
I think I want to maybe expand out the canvas, but you know we have plenty of plenty of time to figure that out today.	O
And then maybe yeah.	CHITCHAT
Ask another character standing in this environment, like interacting with the plane in some way.	O
It's gonna look really cool.	CHITCHAT
Thank Impericon.	CHITCHAT
How's your day going?	CHITCHAT
By the way a man?	CHITCHAT
Anybody else new joining us happy Friday we made it through another week for the most part.	CHITCHAT

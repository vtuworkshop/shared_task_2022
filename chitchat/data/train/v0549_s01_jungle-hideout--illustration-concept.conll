I hope you all are doing good.	CHITCHAT
Feeling healthy say happy everything.	CHITCHAT
And if anyone here is a artist heard talking to the chat and say hi, introduce yourself, tell us what type of work you do.	CHITCHAT
What are you up to today?	CHITCHAT
Garrick working anything for.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to mainly just start figuring out.	O
Serve sketching as you can tell really rough ideas in the background right now so it creates in vines.	O
Stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
This isn't really these days, I just sort of want to feel through it and explore ideas and a pretty messy state right now and then slowly start to build the scene.	O
Interiors are always kind of hard for me, especially this is almost like I don't want to say it's a weird angle, but I kind of want some of the plane to be sort of open and exposed like the windows are gone and stuff you can sort of see through the roof.	O
A little bit here.	O
Will figure it all out though.	CHITCHAT
Big Claudia, how are you nice to see you?	CHITCHAT
Chill David Astika million degrees outside.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, really.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, Eric.	CHITCHAT
It's certainly summer.	CHITCHAT
It's been pretty nice here, relatively speaking, at least I think so.	CHITCHAT
But I love summer is my favorite season.	CHITCHAT
I like warm weather.	CHITCHAT
Hills Homie to me.	CHITCHAT
How much of sort of like the roof?	O
I want to be visible or how much is in sort of destroyed here stand this out just a tiny bit like this.	O
Also, for any of you have been catching the streams of the beaten streams live but haven't seen them after their live.	CHITCHAT
Adobe captures all of the tools I'm using, so every time I like uses different Photoshop technique or something and it shows it all in a timeline during the recorded video after the screen.	O
So if you ever a little bit confused with undoing, feel free to ask, but if you don't have the chance to ask, definitely go check that out.	O
Pretty cool feature.	O
Working nothing right now, but added just something you.	O
Don't push yourself.	O
But if you want to, you should.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I've been working a lot last day or two I did I drew it on yesterday but for work, but it also in the evening I was working on my comic of it, made some really good progress.	O
I was happy about that.	CHITCHAT
I'm just not the same.	CHITCHAT
Hey.	CHITCHAT
Like that?	O
You figure it out.	O
I have the CD's reference photos on the side here.	O
I'm probably just going to be flipping them off and on.	O
I should honestly do and what I did with that other piece you worked on stream the other day I'm trying to paint it sort of like in the style of this one that we did on streaming three weeks ago and I should just be doing the same thing where I have all the reference off to the side.	O
That'll probably smarter.	CHITCHAT
Actually.	CHITCHAT
Wider, but at this area we.	O
There we go.	O
Save all this reference over there in the corner.	O
And it'll lock that layer so they don't accidentally mess with it.	O
Like I tend to do.	O
Doing good, glad to hear it Claudia.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing pretty good as well.	CHITCHAT
Also for anybody who is here or are Tuesday evening stream, this is really fun string.	CHITCHAT

Play.	CHITCHAT
So he was just starting to sketch.	O
I'm very happy with how is looking so far.	O
I mean it is still kind of rough, but.	O
Yeah, you know what I mean.	CHITCHAT
I want you right now is start cleaning up the sketch a little bit like ultimate goal line art.	O
I don't like.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I would just start having an illustration from this point, but because I really struggle with like architecture and interiors and I really don't know a lot about this plane yet, I want to spend some time actually flushing out the drawing and getting it a little bit more solid before I.	O
Start going in and trying to render anything.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
Cinderella inking rush.	O
Cat email.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm not gonna do a pass.	CHITCHAT
Those you do know that when your cat is hungry, it's time to feed them.	CHITCHAT
You're not allowed to tell them the way it.	CHITCHAT
There's no arguing with them.	CHITCHAT
He, as soon as I got up to grab myself some water he likes sprung up immediately like food food.	CHITCHAT
So I'm like, OK, fine.	CHITCHAT
I guess its food time really quickly here.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to open.	O
The Navigator window.	O
And just leave this in the side, so following zoomed into like do some small ink you guys can see the whole piece.	O
Hum so easy to see.	CHITCHAT
And I just put his Gray layer over everything to make it a little bit easier to draw on top of it.	O
Looking good, thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's very kind of you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like with this one and that last piece that we did on scream.	O
I really just been trying to push myself to like make more complex illustrations faster.	O
You kinda trying to level up a little bit.	O
So actually hold on before I do anything though.	O
Hold on 1 second here.	CHITCHAT
I'm wondering if I want to create some sort of perspective guide.	O
I think what kind of helps be a little bit more forgiving with this piece in terms of perspective is.	O
Just the fact that it's it's sort of like broken, disheveled, like falling apart so it's OK if it looks a little bit wacky.	O
But just in case.	O
She came out here.	O
I'm using polygons Hall.	O
There is apparently like a native Photoshop her, but I don't know how to use it.	O
Well, I mean.	CHITCHAT
I'm just gonna use this 99 sided like Star Polygon an as you can see.	O
I'm sorry just dragging it around off screen till I feel like it more or less lines up with the sketch.	O
I'm trying to get the lines to line up with these.	O
Well, no area right now.	CHITCHAT
Ship Hey.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Air power Certificate.	O
Change color.	O
Blue his other son.	O
There's someone honking their car born outside.	CHITCHAT

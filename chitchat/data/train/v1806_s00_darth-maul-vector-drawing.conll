Hello guys, my name is Victoria Power Times, a Photoshop artist and welcome to my studio.	CHITCHAT
Today, Yesterday is the day.	CHITCHAT
Today is Star Wars Day.	CHITCHAT
May the force be with you and guys today I decided to start working on.	O
Star Wars character and I decided to stream.	O
My painting process.	O
You guys, definitely.	CHITCHAT
I will be not able to finish up.	O
Everything in a 30 minute but we will start and I will try to finish my work today and I will post the finished project on my big hands.	O
As always guys now let me rearrange my icons just to see all your beautiful comments.	O
Just like this.	O
Uh, let's see be hands.	CHITCHAT
Facebook just like this.	O
Now I will try to open my reference image.	O
Just like this, and I think we are ready to go.	O
So guys, yes as I said, uhm, I will start working on my Star Wars.	O
Um Star Wars character.	O
Uh, right now I will be not able to finish it with you at during our live stream, but I will finish later on today and I will post this project on my big hands.	O
How let me switch to my desktop camera?	CHITCHAT
Just like that in as you can see I have a already opened in a rough outline of our character.	O
We will be working on today.	O
Um guys I will be periodically looking on in this way because here on my another monitor I have opened my reference image.	O
Yes, I will be using Adobe illustrator.	O
As you can see everything is all ready to go and my reference my sketch aware guys will be on top of my old other layers.	O
As always it's my principle.	CHITCHAT
It's easier for me because if I would like to turn off his ability of my sketch layer I can do it only with one click without going in separately turning off his ability of each alert.	O
And you know, I love my layers.	CHITCHAT
Hi Hi Stadium.	CHITCHAT
So no, I will creating you empty late.	O
I will restart this alere um under my sketch layer just like that.	O
OK, doesn't want to cooperate with me.	O
And guys, if you if I would like to turn off his ability of my sketch layer I can do it just with one click and this is a beauty, at least for me, of having a reference image reference sketch layer on top of your own lives now.	O
I will, um.	CHITCHAT
Use my accurate if tool.	O
Yes guys, I love courage of tool and let's check.	CHITCHAT
Hi Eric.	CHITCHAT
And now I will use a cover for my, um.	O
When a shape all along, he is red but not to read something like this.	O
And I will specify that I don't need any, uh, colour in my stroke.	O
And.	O
First Click to create first courage point.	O
And now I will just, uh, outline this.	O
Beautiful head, I know guys I know you know I made mistake what I will do I will d'elite everything just like that and I will start everything from the beginning because I thought maybe I will avoid.	O
Black Barts in his head.	O
Because it's a red part will be not visible later on, but you know, no, I will do everything as it supposed to be.	O
As you can see, guys accurate of points is absolutely amazing for a tool is absolutely amazing tool.	O
You can create basically anything you like using only one at tool, and if you made mistake, if you think you made mistake, you can fix anything at any time.	O

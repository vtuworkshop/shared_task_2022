How many kerchief points is?	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Is the best haha.	CHITCHAT
How many coaches point you should have?	O
Uhm guys uh be honest.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea.	O
Uh, example.	CHITCHAT
Right now I created a lot of courage of points, but after I, uh.	O
Hi hi, after I closed my shape I can adjust my shape.	O
Um dragging in or out gorgeous points and also likened elite or I can add curvature point at anytime.	O
So what I will do I will drag this courage of point a little bit out and same here.	O
And I think maybe I will delete this corrective point to delete courage of point simply highlighted and click delete key just like that.	O
And.	O
You can move your courage of point up or down in or out.	O
Basically you can do anything you like with the courage of point.	O
Any of them?	CHITCHAT
Example, now I would like to add extra kerchief point, I will click.	O
How long is the pass and roll a look at this?	CHITCHAT
It's super super easy now guys I will hide my top players catch later just like that and this is our basic shape.	O
As you can see, this shape is not proportional.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
As you can see, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Is this a shape is not proportional becausr, uh, uhm, if you will.	CHITCHAT
If you make a Google search, you will see that.	O
Uhm, Darth maul doesn't have proportional phrase, at least in the reference image I have right now because he's ahead is slightly turned on the side.	O
But if you would like, you can make it more a proportional.	O
It's up to you.	O
I will stick to my sketch just like that in again.	O
Guess if I need I will adjust anything later on.	O
And now let's talk about our 3 dimensional form is obviously we are working on a few months or character head.	O
It's supposed to be 3 dimensional looking.	O
I can use any gradient tool or I can use layers with shapes and build 3 dimensional illusion but I can make everything.	O
Is it if I will switch to?	O
Appoint a gradient.	O
And you can switch between points in lines.	O
It's up to you.	O
I will use uhm.	O
Uh, point and I will click on.	O
Let me do it.	O
OK, let me switch.	O
I don't know why it doesn't want to cooperate with me.	CHITCHAT
OK, first point and I will switch to read.	O
I will add another point and I will use a darker shade of red just like that in the beauty of arm.	O
As this point is that I can reposition my point to any a place I want example here he's ahead is darker and I can increase or decrease amount of on this PowerPoint.	O
Now I will add another one, read as I used before.	O
Here will be darker.	O
Much, much, much darker and same here.	O
Maybe it let's me.	O
Yes, just like this look at this guys.	O
Now we have kind of a 3 dimensional illusion without creating a lot of all layers.	O
And one stop will be here in much, much darker.	O
And I will move this one, yes.	O
Uhm, he's left part.	O
This part I'm working on right now.	O
It's darker than his arrival, uh, side.	O
Be cause if you, uh.	CHITCHAT
You will see later on that his light source comes from top right corner, so right part of his face.	O
It will be more uh, highlighted and left part of his face will be in the Shadow Becausr.	O
We are building 3 dimensional.	O
And and it has no nose, forehead, uhm?	O
Uh, I am.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Mouse everything I, uh, I reflect a shadow and light so.	O

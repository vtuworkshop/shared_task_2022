Just like season again I can adjust it.	O
Guys I'm always having question why I'm not.	O
I'm not, uh, creating one part of example human head in.	O
I'm not duplicating this layer in.	O
Adjust fully better an I will have second exact same part of humans or any subject head guys.	O
I don't like doing this BIH cause we all have different, uh, uh?	O
Official are structures our two parts of our face are not identical, so I prefer to build.	O
Uh, be more.	O
Creative are with my characters, but particulare in this example.	O
As you can see, he has identical makeup, so I just build it atop um shape and now I will start outlining his write up part of his uh face shape in.	O
I will duplicate all the shapes in.	O
I will use duplicate for in other part of his face because they're identical.	O

And again, I don't care if my thumb.	O
When I will close my shape it will be not exactly as I wanted because I will fix it after I will close my shape now I've closed my shape and definitely I need to adjust it.	O
So what I will do I will click on any courage point in.	O
I will move it out or in or up or down to um made my shape as I want it to look.	O
Now guys, you know why, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I was saying that I will be not able to finish this are painting interments.	O
It's impossible because he has a lot of details an I don't want to miss any detail because all details are important in his character on makeup.	O

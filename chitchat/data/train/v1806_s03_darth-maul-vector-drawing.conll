Visit shape guys.	O
You can be let me.	CHITCHAT
I turn off my isketch layer with the shape.	O
You can add points you can and create 3 dimensional look of this on.	O
Shape, uh, let's try.	O
So first of all I will re positions is a gradient in.	O
I will use black point for that.	O
Now I will create a new point in.	O
I will use maybe lighter shade of black color.	O
Darker I mean I meant darker shade of Gray color and here I will use black color.	O
Here as well, even a one, a different eye color stop will create 3D dimensional illusion and this is guys.	O
This is super important.	O
Just like this and I will close this shape.	O
Look at this now.	O
We have nice shape.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Now I will create a new empty layer.	O
I will switch back to my.	O
Courage Avant tool I will bring back this ability of my sketch layer in.	O
I will start outlining another shape.	O
If you want, uh.	O
Be able to preview I Yorum.	O
Shape you are working on clearly.	O
Just turn off color in your shape when you're building it.	O
If you just started working with illustrator it will be much much easier for you and now guys look at this.	O
I will start my courage of pointer right here because it's a.	O
It's a middle of his face because I will clone everything to another side and I will continue.	O
Building on my a shape using only a right side right part of his face.	O
Just like this.	O
And again in here as well.	O
He's are right here.	O
Here has a black color, uh, some all shape shapes.	O
We are working on, but I will build this.	O
His ears separately becausr his ear has different detected different than.	O
Colours, uh, different highlights in a lot of different splashes of different colours.	O
So because of that I will build his ear separately.	O

This color will be back to black and this color will be a lighter color lighter shade of Gray becausr.	O
This part of his face has a lot of.	O
Highlights And same here, it's a little bit black and now guys we have kind of three dimensional, but I would like to eat just this.	O
I will use a little bit darker.	O
Yes, just like this.	O
And make it smaller, perfect and now the shape looks exactly as I wanted.	O
I will log this layer.	O

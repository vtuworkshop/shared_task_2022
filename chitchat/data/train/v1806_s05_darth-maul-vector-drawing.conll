So this is his ear and what I will do.	O
I will rename this layer to hear.	O
Just like that just to remember be'cause, its his ear is very important because as I can see on our reference image, as this year has a lot of highlights and a different colors and it's just beautiful.	O
In other, his left ear will be completely in the shadow, so no details will be visible.	O
I will continue working on his ear later on.	O
what I will do right now I will start outlining his horse.	O
I will create a new empty layer.	O
And uh, for his horn I will be using an light Gray color.	O
And I will start.	O
Just.	CHITCHAT
Creating this rough shape.	O
Half of this shape will be not visible.	O
But what I would like to do I would like to add a little bit more details so I will switch to a radial gradient.	O
No, I will switch back to my favorite gradient.	O
Yes, lids disease.	O
Just like sis.	O
An I will be using dark Gray color.	O
In for this stuff.	O
I will be using on.	O
Darker Gray color just like this.	O
Yes yes yes again guys.	O
This arm a shape will be not visible entire becausr at his horn will be on away but still.	O
I prefer to have all possible details I can create.	O
Now let's talk about his horn.	O
His horn on each horn has at least two or three shapes.	O
I will start working from back to front.	O
I will create new empty later I will switch to microchip tool.	O
I will change color.	O
Let's see something.	CHITCHAT
Like maybe disease.	CHITCHAT
Kind of of work hour, but not too warm because he's not warm character.	O
Just like Sis Ann, I will start outlining up back of this horn.	O
Just like that, let me close and definitely I want to change the color.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, yes yes yes.	CHITCHAT
Just like this look at this and now I will create another.	O
Part of his horn I will bring back up.	O
My sketch layer visibility of my sketch layer.	O
And just like this look at this now we have a 3 dimensional look of as his horn already, but definitely we will need to add a more at details.	O
More highlight, more shadows.	O
And again, if you would like to adjust your shape, you can do it at anytime.	O
During your shape creation or after you will close your shape.	O
Everything is up to you.	O
So now this layer has two shapes to pass or on naming shapes you can adjust uh shapes separately.	O
We will talk about this later on, 'cause it's already 30 minutes.	O
I need to finish my stream, but I will be back with some.	CHITCHAT
Finishing Ha project on my big hands later on today so I will post a finished a project.	CHITCHAT
So what I will do guys I will continue working on.	CHITCHAT
These, uh?	CHITCHAT
Character and what I will do guys.	CHITCHAT
I will record a entire process an I will post on my big hands and on my YouTube and you will see you will be able to preview this video on my finished project.	O
I will post on weekends so probably I will spend on it.	CHITCHAT

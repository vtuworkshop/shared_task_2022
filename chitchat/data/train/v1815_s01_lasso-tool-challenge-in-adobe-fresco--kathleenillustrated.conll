Hello, sounds like something that you would forage from your backyard during Quarantine.	CHITCHAT
Are in Christine.	CHITCHAT
I'm so glad that my tweet.	CHITCHAT
My tweet worked.	CHITCHAT
It summoned you here.	CHITCHAT
Hello how are you?	CHITCHAT
How's your Sunday going?	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to start it over here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to move my chair.	CHITCHAT
It might be loud.	CHITCHAT
That was loud, sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'm seeing a what and I'm seeing a question mark, so I'm wondering.	CHITCHAT
If you can hear me, or if you're just confused about my D.	CHITCHAT
OK, good you can hear me all good thanks.	CHITCHAT
Happy to be with you all.	CHITCHAT
Happy to be with you too.	CHITCHAT
OK so I'm gonna tackle a lasso tool landscape or as I like to call it a lasso scape.	O
And if you weren't watching the sketch party last week, this is what that is.	O
Basically we take a reference photo of a landscape and I recreate it with painting.	O
But to make my painting I can only use the lasso tools and selection tools and fresco.	O
Thank you, Aunt Christine.	CHITCHAT
I can only use the lasso tools in fresco to make the shapes so you land on something really cool and kind of geometric.	O
Almost Mary Blair Esque.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I really dig this.	CHITCHAT
It was super fun to do and came together in a way that I was not expecting, so I'm excited to do that again.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm going to do is I'm just going to duplicate this document and we can just use the same.	O
Reference images Yeah, decided not to do more character design because I felt like I didn't get that much done yesterday.	O
Might have been kind of a boring stream so I know what the lasso tool challenge will do.	CHITCHAT
Something fun for the whole hour.	CHITCHAT
Move my iPad.	CHITCHAT
We are going to open up our new document.	O
I'm going to delete everything scary.	O
I'm actually just going to group everything first.	O
And then we can delete the layers we don't need.	O
Ticket ticket do you do?	CHITCHAT
Group Group Group.	O
Right delayed him.	O
But my reference images in here, Nope.	O
Delete him, then don't eat it.	O
Here we go alright Here I reference images.	O
Delete this one.	O
Let me movies around you guys can help me choose which one I want to do I have an idea of which one I want to do, but I would like to hear your thoughts.	CHITCHAT
Before we land on one.	CHITCHAT
And there we go.	O
OK, So what do you think about doing?	O
Either the top right one?	O
Or the bottom one.	O
The top left one feels.	O
Kind of boring to be honest.	O
Just your normal landscape.	O
I'm most interested in the top right.	O
What's up?	CHITCHAT
Jan, Erik.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
I like the top right 'cause it has those very geometric shapes already.	O
That would be fun to make with the lasso tool, right?	O
Well you guys give me your thoughts.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to check on my tea.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
There's carrots and apples in there.	O
Top right, what's up?	CHITCHAT
Wayne your back.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think top right as well.	O
Don't tell Adobe that I'm not using Adobe stock images.	CHITCHAT
Sorry Adobe.	CHITCHAT

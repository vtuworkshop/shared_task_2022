I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
All right, we're going to top right?	O
Is my Apple pencil charged?	CHITCHAT
I think so.	CHITCHAT
Turn these off.	O
There we go.	O
I know you were wondering.	CHITCHAT
Yes, koshy is here with me and yes he is still sleeping on the laundry.	CHITCHAT
I haven't put away, it's his bed now.	CHITCHAT
He owns it.	CHITCHAT
My right or your right?	CHITCHAT
You're right, which is also my right.	CHITCHAT
Oh wrong one that they that one.	CHITCHAT
OK, so first we need to do a little sketchy and actually This is why we changed our app settings to have the light mode.	O
So that.	O
But we move this off lips off the canvas.	O
We can still see it.	O
And Oh yeah, we have to choose a color palette.	O
Maybe I'll just stick with the original one.	O
Let me see if I still have my old color palettes in here.	O
Ooh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I might just stick with the original or bottom right?	O
Definitely not that one that is not sparking joy right now.	O
One of these two, perhaps well.	O
You can't find the lasso tool.	O
I'll show you it's just the selection tool in fresco.	O
It acts as the polygonal lasso tool and a normal lasso tool lasso tool all in one.	O
So if I just tap, it can drop points and be real polygonal about it.	O
Or I can just free draw selection.	O
And I can also switch between them seamlessly.	O
What is that?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Haven't seen doom crossing the music video.	CHITCHAT
Uh, Internal Horizons music video.	CHITCHAT
No, I haven't.	CHITCHAT
I know that Animal Crossing in doom exist in the same cinematic universe.	CHITCHAT
Is it intense?	CHITCHAT
Isabel the doomguy You better believe I already played Animal Crossing today.	CHITCHAT
So first thing I do when I wake up, I gotta check in on my villagers.	CHITCHAT
My favorite villager said she was going to move away and I said no, you ain't just you're staying right here.	CHITCHAT
And so she staying.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well.	CHITCHAT
I will decide what color palette to use.	O
After I start sketching.	O
So let's block in some shapes.	O
Maybe I should just make this a square?	O
I think that would actually be pretty cool.	O
I'll just make this.	O
The same as the top.	O
Oh no no no.	O
No no no no no no.	CHITCHAT
Let's do this.	O
There we go.	O
There we go.	O
Done and done.	O
Alright, let's drop in.	O
The main shapes have got this kind of Rd.	O
Come back here.	O
And I will make this.	O
Much brighter lips.	O
And we will fill it in pixel please.	O
Let's move it down out lips, move it down a little bit.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Crop it.	O
Your Apple pencil of yesterday.	CHITCHAT
Still not sure about it, I find that some of the brushes you have to press very hard to get a line at all really.	O
Are you using like the newest Apple pencil?	O
An fresco 'cause you can change the sensitivity settings in Frisco.	O
I have mine superlight.	O

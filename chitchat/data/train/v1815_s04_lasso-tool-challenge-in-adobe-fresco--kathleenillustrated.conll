Now we can add in some of those lines for the field.	O
How do you deal with the alias line?	O
I know if I use the vector brushes it wouldn't happen.	O
But since this is just a sketch, it's OK.	O
And then when we actually go in with the colours, I'll be careful we won't be using the paint bucket tool, so that will keep it from doing the aliasing.	O
Tom Nook sorry, Tim Cook.	CHITCHAT
That's good.	CHITCHAT
That's a real good.	CHITCHAT
This time, let's say thanks much in New Horizons, too.	CHITCHAT
I think he didn't do leave.	CHITCHAT
I don't think he does.	CHITCHAT
I haven't picked up on that, so I'm going to say no.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to our first layer for the sketch.	O
And let's start putting in these little like hedge lines.	O
One thing that will be helpful is the ruler tool.	O
That's going to help me know where to drop me points.	O
Boom Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Can do the light purple.	O
Maybe the dark purple?	O
Are we?	CHITCHAT
Yeah we are.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Then at this corner there's another one.	O
Change.	O
This one ain't perfect, but that's OK.	O
Then they get skinnier as they go back.	O
And a couple more.	O
Maybe we can switch to the selection brush.	O
All that work, I don't know if that's gonna work.	CHITCHAT
OK, so there's this like I forget what the tool is called, but it's.	O
It's like hold to snap or something like that, so check this out.	O
I can even use it with the selection brush where I draw a straight line.	O
It's not perfect, but if I keep my pencil press down it will snap it to a straight line and then I can.	O
Choose what I want.	O
That was awesome.	O
So we can get like this.	O
They can do it again.	O
And they might need to even do a couple more.	O
Can we will fill those in?	O
Yeah.	O
Looks cool.	O
Beginning to like the lasso tool, trying to follow in my app on iPad.	O
Watching on Surface Pro old one that can get Frisco.	O
OK, so you're watching on your surface, you're playing on your iPad.	O
That's awesome.	O
Thanks for playing along.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this sketch is pretty much done well.	O
We need the road I guess.	O
Jump back to the selection tool.	O
And then it kind of disappears into the trees.	O
They will go for this much more great out though.	O
Already there so we can do.	O
So I'm going to group my sketch.	O
Well that didn't work.	O
There we go.	O
And then we're going to turn down the opacity of the entire sketch, and even from here I might.	O
Move it down a little bit.	O
And flatten it.	O
Squish it.	O
Maybe even rotate it a little.	O
Get that dynamic composition going on.	O
More diagonals please.	O

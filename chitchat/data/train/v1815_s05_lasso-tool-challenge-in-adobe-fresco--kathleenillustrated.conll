But Good.	O
Make a new layer and let's start this time from the background we started with the foreground last time, but.	O
Let's switch it up.	O
So I'm going to use my polygonal lasso tool, and I'm going to drop in the largest shape first.	O
Some kind of just making up.	O
Silhouette Of this tree line.	O
And I'm just going to have it build.	O
And fill the entire wealth.	O
No map.	O
And even do a shoot.	O
Redo, OK, that's fine.	O
And then we used the lettering rake brush, but I think I want to do this.	O
With a different texture, I'm going to see how many of the Mega Pack brushes I can get loaded.	O
And we can choose from that with the Birch brush is a good one.	O
It seems like there's some weird glitching with it.	O
Try the other Birch.	O
That might be good.	O
OK, let's stick with this.	O
Let me favorite.	CHITCHAT
Favorite my favorite, the other one too.	O
And I will grab.	O
The dark blue.	O
Will make the brush bigger.	O
With a Fuller flow.	O
Much bigger please.	O
And let's fill it out.	O
I'm going to try and keep my strokes as horizontal as possible, since these A.	O
That's not good, since these fields are very horizontal.	O
I want to keep that motif through the whole thing.	O
And I might even change my blend mode to clear and just like slightly.	O
Fuzz out these edges a little bit.	O
And go back to normal.	O
Slightly filling back in.	O
Call You tried.	CHITCHAT
It works better, yes?	CHITCHAT
You feel like selections.	CHITCHAT
Our digital artist.	CHITCHAT
Secret weapon.	CHITCHAT
I think so too.	CHITCHAT
It's like using tape with a real painting.	O
You literally by your iPad pro to try fresco.	O
That's awesome.	O
I hope I hope it works in every way that you want it too.	CHITCHAT
It's still a growing app though.	O
New updates every month.	O
Take an invisible tea break.	CHITCHAT
Alright, and now let's add some of these shapes for these furthest back.	O
Hills.	O
So I'm going to.	O
Got that color again, but go a little bit brighter.	O
We're saturated, maybe even a little more towards the green.	O
Side of things.	O
Here.	O
Can I go brighter?	O
Oh no, that's not what I wanted.	O
Here you go get those highlights.	O
Let's add in another Ridge.	O
Grab this color again.	O
Brighter.	O
Go brighter, go home.	O
I'm gonna grab this color again.	O

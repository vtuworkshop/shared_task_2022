Actually Minecraft this one.	O
OK.	O
I've got a country Rd stuck in my head.	CHITCHAT
Not sure why.	CHITCHAT
Then I'm like a back.	CHITCHAT
Let's go to a recent tellers.	CHITCHAT
That's what I want.	CHITCHAT
Will get this most most foreground the shape I know there's a road is somewhere in here too.	O
To go for this.	O
For the highlights.	O
Come back with this.	O
And then go to this.	O
Building up that background.	O
Is that cadmium blue and titanium white?	O
This is a little Bob Rossi, isn't it?	CHITCHAT
You don't know much about fresco.	CHITCHAT
These are life brushes, right?	O
This is not alive brush.	O
These are just normal actual Photoshop brushes from Kyle Websters Mega Pack that you can download if you have a CC subscription.	O
I'll show you the life brushes real quick.	O
So you find them in the second brush section.	O
And you can either do watercolor or oil.	O
There are more brushes coming in the future.	O
It would be fun to do one of these lasso tools with the live brushes.	O
So with the oil I could do this color.	O
Grab this one run brush and mix them.	O
Just like real oil, man.	O
You can change the amount of mix that you have.	O
So that's less of a mix.	O
Or we could do like almost completely.	O
Next, for real blurred edges.	O
And you can also still change like the texture and the angle in all of the dynamics of the till in the tilt and the pressure.	O
All that good stuff and there's water colors too.	O
I just show you real quick.	CHITCHAT
Watercolors are my favorite.	CHITCHAT
So you can see its bleeding a little bit.	O
And then let's go from the blue.	O
Gosh, you keep doing that.	O
They will go for like bright yellow.	O
Start to bleed together.	O
Just like real watercolor.	O
OK, back to our normally.	CHITCHAT
Scheduled programming.	CHITCHAT
So we have a general shape for the background.	O
I'm just kind of whatever on it at the moment.	O
It's like the Sky yellow.	O
Because why not?	O
Go a lot later.	O
Like that color, I think that's from the previous sketch party.	O
One thing I don't like about this Birch brushes it has like hard edge as it's hard to get built up texture without going too far too quickly.	O

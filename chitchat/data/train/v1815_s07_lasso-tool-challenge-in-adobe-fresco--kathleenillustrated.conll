But we'll make it work.	O
Might also just need to play with the blend modes a little bit more.	O
All right, we're going to get this road drawn in here.	O
So it is on.	O
Its own kind of raised.	O
Area.	O
I'm gonna grab the Marigold color.	O
Go lot brighter.	O
A lot less saturated.	O
Cash is over there dreaming Truman Sweet Puppy dreams.	CHITCHAT
Back to Miss Kelly.	CHITCHAT
Lock the transparency here.	O
Grab the purple.	O
Alright, let's start filling in these fields.	O
Fill in the fields.	O
Great colors mix light.	O
Nice Charles.	CHITCHAT
Noise it love a whole lesson on mixing colors and making themes to keep under scream like you've got there.	CHITCHAT
Hey, that's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
I could show you Adobe capture, that's an awesome way to make color palettes.	O
You feel that you're into us is too big.	CHITCHAT
I don't do wide gestures when I draw, so I'm new.	CHITCHAT
I'm the new welcome into a small looks better.	CHITCHAT
It's also wireless so no Courtney Maru.	O
Nice, the Wakeham Intuos at least I guess maybe it's the pro one.	O
Also is Cordless.	O
It needs to be charged, but.	O
The USB cord gets on my nerves since it's on the wrong side.	O
Yeah, I have to switch mine.	O
I switched mine 'cause I don't use the buttons on my medium so I always switch the cord to be on the right side so I'm not always bumping into.	O
It captures the bomb.	O
Yes Steven, are you a capture of Angeles too?	CHITCHAT
I haven't used it in too long.	CHITCHAT
There was I doing filling in the field.	O
Yes yes yes.	O
This is going to be fun.	O
It 'cause I can do it in.	O
One fell swoop.	O
And then I will paint the stripes on top.	O
So we're going to go for the lightest.	O
But if we do like a purple to yellow field, that will be weird.	O
Because those are complementary colors.	O
But I'm OK with weird.	O
We'll start with this.	O
Go pretty big and we will make at.	O
The highlight color will fill in.	O
The field with this first.	O
No, go even brighter.	O
Build up that dark underneath the light.	O
Can a texture?	CHITCHAT
And they will go more saturated.	O
And get some of that going on too, whoa.	O
That noise bother you guys.	O
Starting to get on my nerves, but what can you do?	CHITCHAT
You gotta draw.	CHITCHAT
All right, now we can add the shadow in over on the left.	O

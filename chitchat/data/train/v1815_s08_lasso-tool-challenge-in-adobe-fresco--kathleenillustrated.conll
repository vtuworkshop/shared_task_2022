Let's put on a new layer 'cause I have a feeling I probably won't like the first one that I do.	O
I know myself.	CHITCHAT
And we can also play with blend modes this way.	O
Gonna grab this purple.	O
Let's change our blend mode too.	O
Multiply, make the brush pretty big.	O
Flow pretty low.	O
We got a guest star in the stream.	CHITCHAT
Smarten That's not what I wanted.	CHITCHAT
Website.	CHITCHAT
They're under the sink.	CHITCHAT
So once I had a gas.	CHITCHAT
OH baby.	CHITCHAT
And he locked Koshi in here with me again.	CHITCHAT
That's cool, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Need to get a second Mike to capture the full ASM are goodness.	CHITCHAT
I will never do that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
This is when we play with other blend modes and see which one looks the best.	O
Multiply is probably the answer, but you never know.	O
Sometimes it can be surprised.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Get out of My Swamp.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
That's cool for now.	O
Steven says I guess so does Jan.	CHITCHAT
Erik, he's gone.	CHITCHAT
He's asking me where the bleach wipes were to wipe down the groceries.	CHITCHAT
Steven, you mostly use pallets based on photos.	O
You like the colors from.	O
It's good to limit yourself to 50 Totale.	O
I agree.	O
I always try to build up with likes a dark value, light value, middle value and then the two other ones.	O
Ones usually like a accent color and one is like a more saturated light or more saturated dark.	O
See how this is all coming together, oh?	O
I don't know about this color palette, you guys.	O
Just don't know.	CHITCHAT
Do you wanna go outside?	CHITCHAT
Alright, hold please.	CHITCHAT
Be free.	CHITCHAT
Your girls back.	CHITCHAT
By Neural scribbling with Kathleen Chill.	CHITCHAT
Ustrated 10 hours of chill.	CHITCHAT
Scribbling would make me thousands.	CHITCHAT
You just did that this morning with the groceries.	CHITCHAT
Wasn't sure if we were the only ones.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, no way.	CHITCHAT
Gotta wipe him down.	CHITCHAT
You never know.	CHITCHAT
This is like a nightmare of landscape is not a bad thing.	O
It's just looking at.	O
A little spooky.	O
That's kind of cool.	O
What do we think?	CHITCHAT
Oh God.	CHITCHAT
Boo.	CHITCHAT
Well, if I do this then I get the chance to start over.	O
Oh I think the yellow Sky is kind of freaking me out too.	O
Do do do do.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Let's try that background again.	O
The fact that it's not like literally Green is bothering me.	O
But when have I ever gone with representational colors?	O
So ever happened?	CHITCHAT
You guys?	CHITCHAT
Your pencil nib size to unscrew itself.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
I will go for that.	O
In that good good texture filled in here.	O
Oh my brushes still multiply.	O

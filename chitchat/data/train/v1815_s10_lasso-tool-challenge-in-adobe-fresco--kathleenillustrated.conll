Try out different techniques.	CHITCHAT
This is like the best excuse for me to try stuff that I've never done before, 'cause I'm like, well, it kinda don't like how it's going anyways, so.	CHITCHAT
Why not try something else?	CHITCHAT
That's when the Magic happens.	CHITCHAT
We're going to unlock this.	O
That in there.	O
I like my Lions.	CHITCHAT
Got a little bit crooked.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to.	O
Rotate the yet.	O
Make sure it stays horizontal.	O
It really is a little bit too.	O
And don't forget this moment we got this ruler down here and I used it for the sketch and I'm not using it for this.	O
Well, that doesn't make sense.	O
There we go, looks better.	O
You're doing a portrait with me instead of a landscape today I can't focus to do a landscape.	CHITCHAT
Nice, but a portrait is somehow easier.	CHITCHAT
I like portraits like a million times easier than just.	CHITCHAT
Copying a photo.	CHITCHAT
Nice job.	CHITCHAT
It would be cool to make a blurb book or whatever with your own art in there.	CHITCHAT
I plan to do that with your photography cool.	CHITCHAT
I made my senior portfolio was a blurb book.	CHITCHAT
Is it in here?	CHITCHAT
Would be fun to show you guys.	CHITCHAT
I want to go see if I can find it super quick.	CHITCHAT
I'll be back in like 30 seconds.	CHITCHAT
OK, right back.	CHITCHAT
Found it.	CHITCHAT
So about.	CHITCHAT
My art school experience.	CHITCHAT
I didn't finish my senior year very strong.	CHITCHAT
Because I already had a job lined up and I was like.	CHITCHAT
I guess I can just kind of chill a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I mean like I finished it and got all A's and B's.	CHITCHAT
Don't worry, but.	CHITCHAT
I'm not super proud of these projects.	CHITCHAT
Is what I'm trying to say.	CHITCHAT
There's fun, let me see if I can make my camera bigger.	CHITCHAT
So you can see.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I was in an illustration class.	CHITCHAT
Obviously a children's book illustration class and I made an entire dummy book for the story of David and Goliath.	CHITCHAT
So I have some of those sketches in here.	CHITCHAT
I like this one.	CHITCHAT
It's like a lion with a sheep inside of its belly.	CHITCHAT
I think my teacher thought it was too dark for a children's book and I said that's the Bible Baby, do you expect?	CHITCHAT
I did a cool.	CHITCHAT
Big book rap for the lion, the witch and the wardrobe.	CHITCHAT
I was really into these kind of.	CHITCHAT
Illustrations that kind of fill the entire.	CHITCHAT
Page.	CHITCHAT
With different pieces.	CHITCHAT
And then I really like the back cover.	CHITCHAT
It has, like the white witch and some deer and cool stuff, but the text is way too big.	CHITCHAT
I had no idea what I was doing with text.	CHITCHAT
Still, kinda don't.	CHITCHAT
Kathleen's, a slacker.	CHITCHAT
I was only a slacker because I worked hard and had a job lined up.	CHITCHAT
That's why my Adobe stuff in here.	CHITCHAT
Some of the Illest.	CHITCHAT
Oh wow, that is green.	CHITCHAT

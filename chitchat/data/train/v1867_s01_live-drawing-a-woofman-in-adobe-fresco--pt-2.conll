How's it going?	CHITCHAT
Welcome aboard.	CHITCHAT
Hey everybody in the stream, uh, in the in the everybody is watching how you doing?	CHITCHAT
I hope everybody is having a lovely Thursday.	CHITCHAT
Is it Thursday?	CHITCHAT
It doesn't matter.	CHITCHAT
Time is just meaningless thing at this point anyway, so tonight.	CHITCHAT
Going to be doing a little bit of drawing as we are want to do around here and going to be working on that Wolf Man.	O
Graphic tee design that I'd started last night and if I'm pausing a lot, it's because I'm trying very hard not to sneeze.	O
It's just allergies.	CHITCHAT
I'm from Kentucky.	CHITCHAT
That's where allergies are made, and I'm trying really hard not to.	CHITCHAT
Just you know, 'cause That's going to look amazing on camera, I'm sure, but anyway, yeah, so that's going to be planned for tonight.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be listening to some 90s music.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be talking about nonsense.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be finishing a lovely diet soda.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
And just generally having some fun and talking monsters and talking in T Shirts and talking comics and talking and whatever you guys want to talk about so you can you can pipe up in the chat if you want and I'll do my best to keep an eye on that.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise, let's go ahead and just kind of jump into it here.	CHITCHAT
Does this thing work OK?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so this is where we were last night.	O
This very angry.	O
Where Chihuahua And I will say, I hope you don't feel too betrayed, but I did do a little bit of this.	O
A little bit of work on this one off camera.	O
Just because there are a couple of things I needed to figure out.	O
It wasn't really happy with what I was doing with the ears, so I wanted to kind of do something a little bit more interesting there and just a couple of odds and ends in tonight.	O
We're definitely going to be getting into color.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And I did experiment a little bit with color off camera an I'm but I'm not sure.	O
I I just this is one of those times and I'm totally I am.	CHITCHAT
Like self aware enough to admit that like a lot of times when it comes to something like this, I really don't know where it's going to go with this kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
You know if I'm doing comic book art a lot of times you know doing a Commission or just to something that's fairly straightforward.	CHITCHAT
If I'm drawing Spiderman and Batman or something like that, I pretty much know.	CHITCHAT
Early on, sort of how everything is going to work with, you know a shirt design like this.	CHITCHAT
A lot of times it's kind of up in the air because I could get halfway through it and completely change my mind, and that's fine.	CHITCHAT
You know, that's actually how it works and I found that you get some really good designs that way if you're not, if you commit to where you're going, but you know, look for the Forks in the road on the way because you don't want to miss out on gold, 'cause that will happen.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to be exploring a little bit on what to do about the color.	O
Because if you were here for last night, it looks like this one is going to be going on a Brown T.	O
That's my plan right now.	O
May change in the future.	O
All subject to change.	O
Happy little werewolf mistakes.	O
And but for right now we're going to.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go for like Brown T shirt, and I think the colour is going to be pretty vibrant, so it's going to be a pallet.	O
Kind of like that.	O
It's going to be really bright pop, sort of retro 1950s awesome monster posters, but I don't know it could completely change.	O
All all ideas are subject to revision.	O
So let's get started showing.	O
Hope everybody is well.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to turn the color off again so I can kind of look at what I'm doing here.	O
Now here you can see you see in the background there you can see the pencils that I started with.	O
I'm not going to worry about keeping those pencil me up, sorry.	CHITCHAT
My space station.	CHITCHAT
This cramped so it's gotta shift around a little bit.	CHITCHAT
OK, so yeah, I'm you can see the pencils that I've got right there.	O
And that of course got me started last night, but I think I am going to go ahead and turn that off again, because now this is far enough along where the black inks as we say in the bills need to need to start standing on their own.	O
So the sketch is sort of like the training wheels and it's plenty of time for this one.	CHITCHAT
For the training wheels to come off a little bit.	CHITCHAT
And actually again, there's general processes that I run through when I'm designing a shirt like this.	CHITCHAT
But a lot of times it's you know designs I will have to change.	CHITCHAT

Like creating creating this sort of gives me something that I can very easily mask.	CHITCHAT
Some of the art with just a good place to start, especially if I'm doing something like a like a graphic tee, but I also do kind of the same thing when I'm drawing like comic book art or even just general illustration.	CHITCHAT
Just like general commissions and stuff I tend to follow the same kind of pattern.	CHITCHAT
I've just kind of found it's easy.	CHITCHAT
It sort of solves problems in the future.	CHITCHAT
I gotta tell you it like you know, there's all these different things when you're studying to be an artist and you're working as an artist.	CHITCHAT
There's all these different things that you can do.	CHITCHAT
To make yourself a better artist and sort of more interesting and more, you know all that stuff, but also.	CHITCHAT
I think a lot of times maybe it's easy for us to forget that it's worth taking the time to find ways to be more efficient as an artist too, and I think you're going to find that the artists that are out there that you really admire that you see that are really doing outstanding work.	CHITCHAT
Then there's a bunch of am here on be hands like there's a ton of dudes that are just so much fun to watch him work and to sort of see what their processes.	CHITCHAT
I think I think what you find is often they will have very.	CHITCHAT
Sort of well worn pads for how they like to develop art.	CHITCHAT
You know it's going to be people that they've got it figured out that it's like they want to get from point A to point B to Point C as quickly as possible.	CHITCHAT
Kevin says his windows are all covered in pollen knock on wood.	CHITCHAT
My allergies have been the worst.	CHITCHAT
Haven't been the worst.	CHITCHAT

I think the reason for the pink is like number one.	O
I like the I like really pop color for like it's like pop horror.	CHITCHAT
But then also like I like really dramatic lighting, I like old school lighting.	O
You know, the kind of stuff that I think sort of reached its apex in like the original Suspiria.	CHITCHAT
Where it's just.	CHITCHAT
It's just bonkers lighting.	O
And then you see it and like like sort of the 60s and 70s hammer horror that stuff you know it's just stuff that's really designed to just pop off the screen or pop off the page.	CHITCHAT
It's a 90.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it's a 90s werewolf.	O
That means we also need like we need, like checkerboard textures and stuff.	O

To rounding this thing out, like I said, this part isn't so interesting, but I think you'll see.	O
Why this ends up being so freaking useful?	CHITCHAT
Once again, just vector brush.	O
And this doesn't actually have to be perfect.	O
'cause you can see a lot of my lines don't actually connect, so it's not like the.	O
It's not like there's it fully connects all the way around, but that's fine.	O
'cause this is just a starting point.	O

Yeah, not bad.	CHITCHAT
Now.	CHITCHAT
The interesting thing is I'm noticing that.	CHITCHAT
On the screen, the Brown of the shirt probably looks actually darker than it or or lighter on your screen that it actually is.	O
It's actually a fairly dark Brown, but I think it's kind of being brightened up a little bit.	O
He doesn't even need dental work.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it is terrible.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Hey guys, new guys that are coming into the to watch the video, how you doing we're drawn a Wolf man.	CHITCHAT
All right, uhm?	CHITCHAT
Let's see How do I want to proceed here?	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Maybe now.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's see if that gives me anything.	CHITCHAT
Just trying to get some ideas trying to get my bearings here.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll tell you what I think.	CHITCHAT
What I'm going to do now.	O
Is that layer vector that I just turned into?	O
Or that you know that I'm using for the background right here.	O
I'm actually now I'm going to go double going to click on that.	O
I'm going to convert it to a pixel layer.	O
OK, so now it's no longer vector, it's pixels, so if you zoom in you can see.	O
Well if I can get to a place where you can actually see it there we go.	O
Now you can see it's actually there's pixels there, so it's now a pixel layer.	O
Right on cue, everything on my computer starts beeping.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's see here.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now that's a pixel layer, and the reason I change it to a pixel layers.	O
Now I can click on it and I can click mask layer contents and it has created a.	O
A mask there you go.	O
That was weird.	CHITCHAT
It didn't pop up immediately.	O
There it is.	O
OK so you can slide back and forth in Frisco between them at see there's a mask.	O
You can see it in red, then I slide it and it hides the mask and the benefit of that is I can click on that hit copy mask, create a new layer, tap face mask.	O
And then now I've got a layer that I can.	O
Draw on.	O
And it's masked CEO that was actually kinda cool.	O
Pop art very neat, alright?	CHITCHAT
OK, so the reason we did that is let's going to pull back up my palette here.	O
Alright, and I'm just going to start looking.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start looking for what I want to do with this guy.	CHITCHAT
OK, So what I'm thinking?	CHITCHAT
Is.	CHITCHAT
These are going to be the three tones could completely change, by the way, but those are going to be 3 tones and I'm sort of imagining that the light is coming up.	O
Sort of it's coming Lou and sometimes you lock your iPad.	CHITCHAT
Come on there, we go open up, open up, there we go.	CHITCHAT
The light is coming up from the bottom, so it's getting that dramatic like flashlight sort of error.	O
Telling a Horror Story sort of thing.	CHITCHAT
So here this is not going to be the final art, I'm just trying to find sort of where those shapes are going to be, and I'm imagining that the red is kind of the.	O
The most receding.	O
And the green is kind of like the midrange color, and then I've got that sort of Lemony yellow that's going to be like the.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
You know the other thing.	CHITCHAT
I don't talk so good when I'm trying to do too much at once.	CHITCHAT
And then I'll probably do something really funky with his eyes.	O
It's always best kind of somehow highlight the eyes.	O
OK, now this isn't the final art.	O
What I'm doing here is I'm just trying to find the places where that light is going to touch.	O
OK.	O
It's going to touch some of the fur, but it's not going to touch all of it.	O
'cause remember the first kind of dense.	O
Little bit on the ears is just going to sort of tip the ears a little bit.	O
There you go and this is just going to be a guide for me.	O
To sort of figure out like this is, this is how he's going to look.	O
Not too bad, not too bad.	O

OK.	O
Not bad at all, alright.	CHITCHAT
OK, so then now I'm going to pick up the yellow again.	O
Just hold it down, grab that color.	O
OK, so the stuff that's going to be really prominent.	O
Obviously you're going to be like teeth.	O
And you know now that I look at it.	CHITCHAT
That is not quite extreme enough, so let's see here.	O
Hang on.	CHITCHAT
See if we can do something a little bit.	O
More yellow, little bit deeper, yell.	O
OK, let's see what that's going to look like.	O
See if it's going to be because I actually don't want to contrast too much, because that sort of gives it that pop look, so I don't want the green in the yellow to be too far apart just enough.	O
Just enough that your eyeballs will notice it.	CHITCHAT
And generally, I think the yellow is going to be kind of where it's going to kind of be the stand in for white.	O
Yeah, that's not not too bad.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
And write hello new people or watching the stream how you doing?	CHITCHAT
If you're not already, I am on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
It's I sub on pretty much.	CHITCHAT
You can find me anywhere.	CHITCHAT
I'm always I so Bonnies on everything and I'm on everything so.	CHITCHAT
Alright, OK, let's see if I can give him.	CHITCHAT
Maybe his eyes are red.	O
It's not bad, not bad, whoops.	CHITCHAT
OK.	O
Not bad.	CHITCHAT
OK now it looks like what I'm going to do.	CHITCHAT
Is I'm going to create another layer an I love the pink and I love the green and I love the yellow.	O
So it's working for me and I'm kind of hang on lots of stuff here.	CHITCHAT
OK, so it's working for me.	CHITCHAT
But I think what I need is I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to need a deeper.	CHITCHAT
Something that's going to?	CHITCHAT
It's going to be a deeper sort of background color so that we're going to start with that, because it just needs that one more layer of something OK.	O
Maybe even deeper than that.	O
Still wanted to be still want to be kind of hot.	O
Let's let's see what it looks like.	O
It's a purple.	O
Do I like that?	CHITCHAT
Not like that?	CHITCHAT
OK, so it's miss make it more of a more of a red.	O
See what that looks like.	CHITCHAT
And now that I'm kind of digging.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
OK, Alright so now again I'm just sort of using the color to find the shapes.	O
So this is not going to be the final.	O
Just finding out where the shapes are going to be so I can figure out.	O
Sort of how what the color to fall.	O
OK there, and here's thing, and I'm going to put it around the eyes because I want to make sure that it's.	O
The eyes really pop out.	O
And I'm probably going to make the mouth black.	O
I'm not entirely sure yet, but kind of get started with that.	O
OK.	O
This will give him a little bit of form on the face.	O
Why are my ear buds popping out?	CHITCHAT
I think my ears are weird.	CHITCHAT
Actually, my ears are legitimately weird.	CHITCHAT
I was told that by a doctor.	CHITCHAT
I have odd ears.	CHITCHAT
And I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually not kidding.	CHITCHAT
That's actually a thing that happened.	CHITCHAT
There were, like, your ears are weird.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
OK, not bad.	CHITCHAT
Not bad.	CHITCHAT
Not bad, not bad.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so just trying to figure out the shape here.	O
How does he look?	CHITCHAT
How is this color combo?	CHITCHAT
Kind of work.	CHITCHAT
OK, now I need to start OK.	O
I'm going to merge these layers 'cause I need to start thinking.	O
Thinking together here.	O
Oh, and I did a thing.	CHITCHAT
I'm stupid.	CHITCHAT
I do that every time I actually accidentally put that all on that one layer.	O

Everybody sing along.	CHITCHAT
Good suggestion Laura.	CHITCHAT
Laura came in swinging.	CHITCHAT
I was full on expecting like softball.	CHITCHAT
Yep, this is the soundtrack right here.	CHITCHAT
So I can tell you that eventually, eventually what's going to.	CHITCHAT
Laura Lol Yes Lol indeed.	CHITCHAT
And what's eventually going to happen here is I'm laying down some solid color.	O
But when this is really going to start perking up is I've got some I've got in my head.	O
Anyway, I've got some plans to come in with with lots of sort of interesting gradients and maybe even some halftones.	O
To just really kind of.	CHITCHAT
To really kind of.	CHITCHAT
Pull it into a.	CHITCHAT
Sort of a weird, almost psychedelic art.	CHITCHAT
Kind of space.	CHITCHAT
Hello new people.	CHITCHAT
Party people.	CHITCHAT
Come on in, We're all friends here.	CHITCHAT
So I think a lot of times what you find is when you're doing something like this, particularly where the lighting is such an important part of the composition is.	O
I'm really trying to focus like on the center, the center line of the face, and so the detail I'm trying to I'm trying to work from, like the bottom up.	O
Because it's kind of.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of how your eye moves across the drawing.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
I mean, like when you see something like this, it's like that's your teeth and then your eyes just kind of go up.	O
So that's kind of the hierarchy that I work on this piece.	O
Anyway, that's like the hierarchy I'm working in.	CHITCHAT
Wow, Holy Cow, I'm gonna burp myself to death guys excuse me I wonder why.	CHITCHAT
It's a mystery.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
It's funny, I remember.	CHITCHAT
So right now it's on my music is as per Laura's suggestion, Nirvana smells like teen spirit.	CHITCHAT
And what I remember this from the most was I remember.	CHITCHAT
Being I took Japanese was a class that I took in high school.	CHITCHAT
And I remember sitting waiting for class to start.	CHITCHAT
With headphones on.	CHITCHAT
Listening to this like I mean it was just like my like.	CHITCHAT
Go to prepare for class kind of kind of music.	CHITCHAT
You also all know how old I am now.	CHITCHAT
I'm old.	CHITCHAT
Very, very old.	CHITCHAT
I am an elder.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you're not hearing the music.	CHITCHAT

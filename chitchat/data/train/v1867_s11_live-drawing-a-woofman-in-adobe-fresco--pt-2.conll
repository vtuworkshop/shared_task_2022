Yeah, oh, actually, I should have explained Laura.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately, the music is just for me.	CHITCHAT
Because it's a, It's broadcasting, so I can't actually.	CHITCHAT
I can actually play the music for everybody, but you know what?	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's what I need to do.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I need to figure it out.	CHITCHAT
I need to figure out like how to like share a playlist and then people can go and they can listen to the playlist and we can all kind of sync up.	CHITCHAT
There might be fun.	CHITCHAT
I don't have embedded care, but it be fun.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, so that's what I'm listening to.	CHITCHAT
That's what I'm listening to.	CHITCHAT
My ear buds and you guys are getting my funky spaceship background music.	CHITCHAT
Where are we?	CHITCHAT
Oh, we're almost an hour already.	CHITCHAT
I may go a little longer today.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it would be cool or I am going to try to do that.	CHITCHAT
I think I'll try to like I might start to set a like.	CHITCHAT
Here's the soundtrack for this for this for tonight's drawing.	CHITCHAT
And then then anybody that wants to we can sync up.	CHITCHAT
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can find like a YouTube playlist or I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We'll figure it out.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think that would be fun.	CHITCHAT
See what am I doing here?	CHITCHAT
I feel like I'm messing up.	CHITCHAT
OK, there we go.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's see how much shaping up.	O
OK, so a lot of this is going to get tweaked, but every bit of this is just to sort of further.	O
Get a little bit closer in a little bit closer, and it's not.	O
You know, and I think the secret, for a lot of artists.	CHITCHAT
Is so often it's not going to be.	CHITCHAT
It's not like you really know exactly where you're going.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you should know where you're going.	CHITCHAT
You know you're really just trying to find it.	CHITCHAT
You gotta let you gotta let the process kind of direct itself a little bit.	CHITCHAT
And just kind of go with your gut.	CHITCHAT
In my case, that's a substantial gut.	CHITCHAT
Timmy says he likes that idea.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that would be fun.	CHITCHAT
I think that I think would be a good time.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Also, Timmy Timmy we need to get you.	CHITCHAT
We need to get you on here man.	CHITCHAT
We need to get you hooked up on on on the Skype machine and uh.	CHITCHAT
Get you get you skyping in Timmy, fellow artist, fellow designer.	CHITCHAT
We could talk about coffee, dogs and daughters.	CHITCHAT
No big whoop, you know.	CHITCHAT
K let's figure out.	CHITCHAT
Sort of what's going on here.	CHITCHAT
In all seriousness, I often reflect.	CHITCHAT
How lucky I am I get to do this really.	CHITCHAT
It's.	CHITCHAT
I legitimately enjoy doing this, and I legitimately enjoy talking to people and do it.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
But being able to.	CHITCHAT
Sit and draw art.	CHITCHAT
And like.	CHITCHAT
You know that's the thing you spend your time doing.	CHITCHAT
I love it because I had an office job.	CHITCHAT
And sometimes you gotta have an office job.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It is not easy.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it doesn't have to be a nightmare, but it's a lot of times.	CHITCHAT
It's you know.	CHITCHAT
You get compromises.	CHITCHAT
And it's not that you're ever going to run out of compromises, but.	CHITCHAT
But it's nice to be able to do something you like.	CHITCHAT
And make big scary monsters, monsters with giant.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, that's fun too.	CHITCHAT
Once again, I just want to congratulate Laura on her choice of albums.	CHITCHAT

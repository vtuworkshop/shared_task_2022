Because this rocks.	CHITCHAT
This is what I needed.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you just have to hear angry 20 somethings.	CHITCHAT
And then remember when I was an angry 20 something.	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't 20 something when this was out, I was still very much a teen.	CHITCHAT
But yet here I am old and still listening to it.	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	O
That's a Wolf man.	O
Yeah, Laura says Yeah, the office job always sucks.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, kinda it's never.	CHITCHAT
I mean don't get me wrong like that.	CHITCHAT
It has moments like it's there were moments when my office job was pretty OK when it was actually kind of satisfying.	CHITCHAT
'cause it was.	CHITCHAT
Still design and art and that sort of thing.	CHITCHAT
But you're also, you know, I can tell you this that as an artist as you get older as an artist, it gets more and more compelling.	CHITCHAT
The notion of not having to.	CHITCHAT
How can I put this?	CHITCHAT
Being able to make your own choices when it comes to the art becomes more and more important because as you get older with it, you get a little bit more confident with it and you get more.	CHITCHAT
And it's true.	CHITCHAT
You can also get more complacent, but you get more confident with it.	CHITCHAT
And you build up experience and you build up like you know, I mean, that actually had a situation.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like that here recently, where in it.	CHITCHAT
And this is pretty frequently, so I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I'm not picking on this particular client, but a lot of times you have clients that will sort of get cold feet about something.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I kind of don't want this, but I kind of and you gotta tell him.	CHITCHAT
I understand.	CHITCHAT
But Trust me, sit with it for a day or two.	CHITCHAT
And, Uh, I have a feeling that you will see that the choice that I've made for you is you're going to like.	CHITCHAT
And what you find is 9 times outta 10.	CHITCHAT
You're right like 9 times outta 10.	CHITCHAT
They'll come back to you will be like, Oh yeah, you're totally right.	CHITCHAT
I was over thinking it so good.	CHITCHAT
Call every now and then they'll be like no, I still want my thing.	CHITCHAT
But most of the time people are people.	CHITCHAT
You know they're so they're too close to it, so it's part of your job, sort of as a as a pro to be like, you know, sit with it, look at it for a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I think you'll see I made the right choice for you.	CHITCHAT
And usually people are pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Holy cow did not change color.	O
There we go.	O
But unfortunately, like an office setting, that's more difficult because everybody is kind of under the same restraints and everybody's sort of.	CHITCHAT
Yeah Laura, these are not the droids you're looking for.	CHITCHAT
I have pulled a few Jedi mind tricks in my time in corporate.	CHITCHAT
The real trick with corporate art.	CHITCHAT
If anybody out there is working for, you know.	CHITCHAT
Let's say, like.	CHITCHAT
Not a design company, but like like just a company that makes a widget or whatever.	CHITCHAT
The real trick is always give him options and give him a really crappy option.	CHITCHAT
I mean, this seems obvious, but it does actually work.	CHITCHAT
Give me a crappy option given the option that you wanted to pick and then give him something wild.	CHITCHAT
You know, eventually I'll have to.	CHITCHAT
I'll need to make sort of a video and talk about my mild wild spicy thing, which is not my thing.	CHITCHAT
Like actually, there's a number of designers you kind of hear that or some variation of that, but it's like you give him a.	CHITCHAT
You give him three options.	CHITCHAT
You give him the safe option.	CHITCHAT
You give him a sort of the option that is the strongest in your head.	CHITCHAT
You don't call it that, but then you give him like a wild option.	CHITCHAT
And so when you have fun with and then maybe they pick that and then you're like, Oh cool, they picked a cool one.	CHITCHAT
Forgot how cool is album was.	CHITCHAT
I haven't listened to some of these songs along time.	CHITCHAT
That is not bad.	O
The Wolf man.	O
I think we're actually getting to a stopping point because I feel is really what I wanted to do for tonight.	O

Was I really did hang on.	CHITCHAT
Let me stop Nirvana here really what I wanted to do for tonight is I wanted to figure out.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to really concentrate on getting the face getting that solid because handling the face and then handling all the fur around it is going to be a really different process.	O
So I'm going to definitely.	CHITCHAT
I probably do most of that all offline, but then the next my next live stream, which I'll probably do it tomorrow night.	O
Uhm, well depending I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I've got some stuff I need to do tomorrow that may wear me out a little bit, so I might I might not, but I think the next time we're going to do the part three of our Wolf man here is we're going to come back and I'm going to start adding in some of the special effects with special brushes and halftones and gradients and start really pop culturing this thing up a little bit.	O
And yeah, I think that's I think that's going to be a good plan.	CHITCHAT
'cause I think we're going to good place.	CHITCHAT
We are really tonight.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to find the face and I think I found the face so I'm probably going to probably going to finish out what I'm doing here offline like tomorrow during the day.	CHITCHAT
And then the next time we meet and we talk about this dude is we will do something.	CHITCHAT
Will do something like a lot more.	CHITCHAT
This will be more the fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
I mean not that this wasn't fun.	CHITCHAT

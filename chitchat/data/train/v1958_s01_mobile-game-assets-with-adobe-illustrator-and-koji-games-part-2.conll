Just the artwork.	CHITCHAT
There's this website called.	O
With koji.com There's a link in the description of this video down below.	O
If you scroll on down, you'll see the links and and so basically you get an account.	CHITCHAT
It's free to join and there's a ton of templates, a lot of artists are a lot of developers have put together an amazing list of games that you can then edit yourself.	O
The part that I edit is the artwork.	O
A lot of these developers they put in artwork or basic art that they know it's not going to stay there.	CHITCHAT
Even placeholder art just so that you know this is the areas that you're gonna come in and edit yourself.	CHITCHAT
So what I'd like to do is take a look at some games that are out there.	O
Find the ones that attract my attention that I feel like, oh, I know I can put A twist on this and then jump right on it.	O
So this past weekend I did I worked on this template called balls versus animals in the created a game called.	O
Killer bees right.	O
In this themed around Wu Tang, then last night I started another version of the same game.	CHITCHAT
This one I'm calling art life all day.	CHITCHAT
And so when I deal with my games, I either affine, a theme that fits the art life and it has to do with art, or I try to find a fan art type of thing and the only fan art that type of thing that I've ever done has been the boots and stuff.	CHITCHAT
So I got two Wu Tang games out there, so check him out it.	CHITCHAT
Check out the website, check out the links.	CHITCHAT
I added a link to the game at the description of this video so you can try playing it, trying it out on will showcase.	CHITCHAT
I will show a little bit of that game here.	O
Today I'm also going to show you how I've edited certain things so far and I'm a jump on illustrator to go ahead and create more blocks that are going to go in this game, right?	O
So we're ready to go.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and get ready.	CHITCHAT
This is the angle that you're going to see me in.	CHITCHAT
Oh yes, a lot of light because it's daytime.	CHITCHAT
Usually we don't have that much daytime and then let's go ahead and get into the stream mode, alright?	CHITCHAT
So an please leave a comment, question or suggestion in the chat box.	CHITCHAT
I will answer it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to stay on long tonight.	CHITCHAT
Today I'm going to stay here for another hour and a half Max.	CHITCHAT
I have a 3:00 o'clock meeting alright so.	CHITCHAT
Before we get started, let me go ahead and close some of these windows there it is.	CHITCHAT
So this is the game, right?	CHITCHAT
This is a game that I created.	O
So you play the game by clicking on the play button uh-huh and then you go boom bam boom bang right?	CHITCHAT
And, uh, so so you're aiming the pencil at these blocks.	O
And it's how you ain't a pencil that will give you a bigger advantage to knockout these blocks because the strategy is important because you only have like 4 pencils right here and that number, right?	O
There's four, and so I need to make sure all of these hit that four.	O
But I also need to hit other blocks so I can make sure that I don't lose.	O
And so if I keep working on it like this, boom, boom boom, I knocked off that first layer.	O
So cool.	CHITCHAT
And so in artist life.	CHITCHAT
We work on different projects at the same time.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes we take on projects while we still working on a project and we're going to start this other project in the later date.	CHITCHAT
As soon as we finish this project and we try to add him into a calendar, and that's kind of like the one I'm looking at here.	CHITCHAT
This is a game where you have layers of projects.	CHITCHAT
And these are drawing projects that you need to work on and they keep piling on piling on, piling on.	CHITCHAT
They get closer and closer and closer, and so is your job as an artist.	CHITCHAT
As a creator, to go ahead and raw or get these projects can accomplish some projects are have low numbers like that one right here.	CHITCHAT
Others are like that 9 or 18 over there and so and you only have so much time and so much skill to get to those and so here is Oh Man, I might lose their egos 3.	CHITCHAT
This one has to hit this this floating pencil this jumping around right now and needs to hit this block at least two times otherwise I lose.	O
SC.	O
Alright, Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Here we go Boom Boom Boom boom there it isn't it one time.	CHITCHAT
Let me drink my coffee while I see this play out.	CHITCHAT

That has the Wu Tang and this is the backside of coaches.	O
Really easy is Real Simple.	CHITCHAT
Here is the other game I made is called Killer Beans Open and you lay on the window and boom.	O
And is the same basic idea.	O
However, one thing to keep in mind is that you get to create the artwork for it, and if you're an illustrator artist, designer of some kind, then this is a way to get into the practice of producing our work.	O
Does ready for gameplay?	CHITCHAT
Oh, that didn't want this on like that.	O
I wanted to know that one right there.	O
This is the way to get practice into developing art is going to show up on the screen of any size and you need to practice on it.	CHITCHAT
You need to.	CHITCHAT
You need to get better at it.	CHITCHAT
Get good at it, figure out your process on how to make it happen.	CHITCHAT
So there it is.	CHITCHAT
There's a Wu Tang.	O
And so this character.	O
These blocks made up of a character that's featured in the cover of the Wu Tang clan original album.	O
Bone bone bone bone.	O
Alright here we go yes yes yes look at that and so when I was creating the characters thinking well, what kind of block should I have here?	O
And of course, the first idea is like, well, let's make the Wu Tang clan the blocks right?	O
All the name members in so it.	O
So when I started thinking about it and researching it, I realized that these numbers are going to get stuck in the front of the face of these characters.	O
So you're not going to see like who are the real characters?	O
They're not going to know.	O
And recognize them or anything.	O
So then that's when I said, well, what if I did that same character in different colors?	O
And then that's what you have here.	O
You have different colours.	O
So here we go Boom Boom Boom Boom boom.	CHITCHAT
Bum, I'm not going to stay on too long.	CHITCHAT
'cause then it would be here all day.	CHITCHAT
I have spent hours playing this game I am telling you is awesome.	CHITCHAT
Woo let's put the Wu submit.	CHITCHAT
And boom, there I am looking at 162 thousand points.	CHITCHAT
That's how much I played this game.	CHITCHAT
We got other people also that or did you not?	CHITCHAT
Came up Reagan Evie came up.	CHITCHAT
Nice tango wow, so I'm in a couple of discord.	CHITCHAT
San slack, chat channels and so I shared the link.	CHITCHAT
Wow wow, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
And so basically with these two games, what you're looking at is I don't have it up right now.	O
Basically what it is is that you.	O
Creating a game and you have to make sure you create the backgrounds you have to edit the colors, the fonts, the music if you want and then really get down on the assets.	O
So let's take a look at the game.	O
So when you when you like a gang.	O
Let me see if I can find that one animals balls.	O
Versus animals here it is.	O
This is the original game.	O
Damn and so enter created this game.	CHITCHAT
And it's just the ball.	CHITCHAT
You turn a bog in some animals, kind of like like what is that game that kickball?	CHITCHAT
Dodgeball.	CHITCHAT
Yeah that's it.	CHITCHAT
This is dodgeball and so he's got the red ball.	CHITCHAT
You bounce it at at these animals, right?	CHITCHAT
Poor animals.	CHITCHAT
And you know, in the morning, and so you gotta keep hitting them animals before they get to you alright alright COO COO COO COO COO.	CHITCHAT
And then so the key is to aim this at the proper place to get the maximum damage, and so sometimes you want to bounce it off the wall.	CHITCHAT
So it comes at an angle, boom, boom, boom, boom and see Bang Bang Bang Boom Boom Boom, Bang Bang Bang.	CHITCHAT
Alright there it is dodgeball alright cool that's the game so when you get to inside to the edit part of Koji now your options are to change the title.	O
Our life all day change the instructions touching tainted throw.	O
Um, draw on our papers and collect pencils.	O
Those are my instructions.	O
And then here's the font.	O
So we go to Google fonts to get font and I had to do is replace that.	O
That last word, which would be the title, the font, the name of the font button, colours, hover colors.	O
I guess there goes it hovers.	O
Let me go ahead and change that hover color.	O
To reflect my Brandon see then it.	CHITCHAT
Then there it is.	CHITCHAT
Look at that wow.	CHITCHAT
Background color that's going to be the color that shows up in the game when you're playing that right there.	O
Uh, you know, that's the the UI colors that color.	O

I don't know where the background color is.	O
Huh, I guess that's up here.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I know there's a little bit of edge on the routes I don't know.	O
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
Either case, there we go and then then you can start changing the game background and my case would I did as they kept saying background all for the main an for the game background.	O
That way I don't have to redraw it in.	O
And what I like about this is that I like my cup of coffee in my pencil to show up right there and then whichever screen you're on.	O
This background changes a size to fit the screen and uh, and so it's I couldn't get it to match and that's what I really want.	O
I like what the Internet is that you know.	CHITCHAT
So he got the background.	O
You know, very light and blue and then the basic background.	O
Here it has agreements in the trees and.	O
But depending on the screen size you're an, it doesn't match and so is not a not a big deal.	O
I do think that maybe I can come up with a scene.	CHITCHAT
Maybe our store you know in a bunch of art materials that could be something my theme is art life.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so there's that and then boom.	CHITCHAT
Here goes the ball.	O
That's the ball that I that I made my ball is the pencil.	O
And while we're talking let me start up illustrator 'cause it takes a second.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And then the blocks, and so all of this comes at one time when you looking at the quick start tab.	O
But if you go to colors tab then you can just see basic.	O
The only the things that fit that category.	O
So the colours the images.	O
Settings so, um, the title and again you know the instructions when you looking at to publish.	O
Now that's when you get to put in the actual name, right?	O
In some ideas of what you want to say.	CHITCHAT
As a matter of fact, let me.	CHITCHAT
A dead.	CHITCHAT
Write something in a posted it on Facebook because my.	CHITCHAT
My grandma my Granny.	CHITCHAT
Granny's wow.	CHITCHAT
And beautiful alright come on let's go.	CHITCHAT
So I was wanna show me more stuff is well here it is.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah yeah.	CHITCHAT
So aim the pencil to draw on the materials.	O
It's very strategies to catch up.	O
There it is.	O
Copy.	O
And now I can put that in.	O
All the pace.	O
There it is, and a pencil to draw on the art materials creeping down the screen.	O
There is a there is line paper Black Book Canvas.	O
An more coming down experiment strategies to catch up with your art pieces.	O
There we go.	O
Alright, advanced options would be to allow remixing or whatnot, and even give a tip to the developer's already gave him a tip.	O
I don't have much right now.	CHITCHAT
Got 55 pennies, so I'm gonna wait for the next time I have some money for this and then I hit publish.	CHITCHAT
So I made a couple errors in the color in the.	O
UM game info however.	O
I'm going to publish so you can see how that process works and is very simple.	O
And that gives us enough time for illustrated startup.	CHITCHAT
Plus I could tell you a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
And part of the setup with Koji is that as the illustrator as an artist I can upload and create.	O
I can create assets, upload them into the asset store or packages.	O
I forget what they're called to have a name here on Koji and then I can get paid for it by other creators who want to use my artwork.	CHITCHAT
see I clicked on here that says that they clicked off where it says allow remixing because when this game is.	O
Is out in the public.	O
In coaching you can remix it.	O
You see it says remix with Koji.	O
And when you click on that then it says, Hey, here's A the The Creator.	O
This is the name you can create a remix, there's trouble remix.	O
It's already who are they?	CHITCHAT
And so anybody who remix is a game, they they get, they get the back, the back end of the game with all the artwork has been created in the game Ann so and so.	O
I don't want people using my artwork and so then that's why I.	CHITCHAT
That's why I go ahead and not allow remixing because I don't want others.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, I'm selfish, but I want my artwork to live a particular life and I want it to be a certain way this person made aliens look at that he added aliens.	CHITCHAT
And so if I was to remix this mix this this remakes, I get to have those alien uhm?	CHITCHAT

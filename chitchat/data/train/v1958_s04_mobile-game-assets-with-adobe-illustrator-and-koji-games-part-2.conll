Assets.	CHITCHAT
And so I don't want others to use my assets.	CHITCHAT
And this got different monsters, and so as an illustrator, as an artist, I would make sure that all my artwork matched in style an match in theme and then the background match.	CHITCHAT
And so here's somebody who trying something now and just did it.	CHITCHAT
So let's see the remix.	CHITCHAT
There it is Mohammed.	CHITCHAT
Is he FAQ, so he did that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I should see his leaderboard.	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
That's crazy, you can play the game right here.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that was me.	CHITCHAT
I got a 49 points.	CHITCHAT
I can play the game right here, look.	CHITCHAT
That's crazy.	CHITCHAT
This is nuts.	CHITCHAT
This is insane.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
OK, KKK, Cuckoo, Cuckoo.	CHITCHAT
And then while you're at koji.com, there's a ton of other stuff, so I I've already reserved a few.	CHITCHAT
I got this one already.	CHITCHAT
Let me show you my Polaris Remixes.	CHITCHAT
I have these are my games.	CHITCHAT
Anne, let me see what this one is.	CHITCHAT
I forgot I forgot how they play my games.	CHITCHAT
I made a lot of them and I need to fix the artwork.	CHITCHAT
So another one I might be hands lashing is going to be where I just redo a bunch of artwork.	CHITCHAT
Alright, Draw Something on the surface is so they appear to pop them.	O
Don't let any services explain to so I gotta click.	O
I gotta tap on this and if I tap that one everything blows up.	O
Boom there it is and look.	O
These are all those sketches on sketches are done and then what are these?	O
Oh, there's a stop and then boom, that's it.	O
Cuckoo cool.	CHITCHAT
And so you have all these lives right there.	O
There's a whole lot of lives.	O
And instead of a heart, it's a pencil.	O
So all this artwork is cool like this art was not too bad looking as you play the game there is this artwork I created it either on fresco or sketchable.	O
But then I realized that there was that I needed to have a game cover, which is what's in here and answer.	O
Some of them are terrible like that.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't look good.	CHITCHAT
That doesn't look good.	CHITCHAT
This is just A the Wooten logo and that's not good.	CHITCHAT
I need to do something about that and this might wu-tang game.	O
Just like Candy Crush, but is called protect your neck.	O
It's a little boom.	CHITCHAT
The more you do.	CHITCHAT
Bang.	CHITCHAT
So you got the strategy here is to get all the similar colors out the way, so then you have room.	O
So that's all dirty The blue one met.	O
The man is the green one.	O
Rake wanted chef is purple and then the yellow is there is a.	O
Alright, I got a lot of stuff so you only got 3 minutes right?	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh let me go here.	O
We go.	CHITCHAT
Alright come on let's get rid of these folks.	O
OK, that's that's that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Did not get the get the Rissa.	O
I mean Rick wanted chef and boom look at that.	O
Bumped me out like I didn't even pay attention.	O
How many points?	O
But that's a lot of points.	O
OK cuckoo, so I'll do the same thing.	O
Let's get all the green ones out the way Blues and you're trying to get rid of things that are stuck together so you get more.	O
Points, but you know, that's that's not always going to be.	O
The way to to get rid of these.	O
Colours, sometimes it works in your favor or sometimes it don't.	O
Where we got we got a minute and 1/2.	O
I'm pretty proud of my games.	CHITCHAT
Let me tell you it is, uhm, you know it's not a steam game is not PlayStation game or you know console game, but as an illustrator you want the opportunities to practice, practice, practice, practice uses as your portfolio and then and then find a way to monetize either, not necessarily the game but at least the idea that you are a professional who can produce stuff right?	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to redo all this artwork there it goes, bang.	O
Boom, there it is.	CHITCHAT
So I guess something and so on.	CHITCHAT
And if you can hear the music.	CHITCHAT
First, my mother.	CHITCHAT
Don't get the instrumental.	CHITCHAT
That that it's all annoying.	CHITCHAT
Any case there it is?	CHITCHAT
So that's an idea.	CHITCHAT
That's how I just one of my other games an I should I should link this here.	CHITCHAT

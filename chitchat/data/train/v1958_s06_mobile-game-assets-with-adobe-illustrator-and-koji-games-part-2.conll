Uh yes yes yes.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let's make one other backward background back here.	O
Now I got two, got it good.	O
Lock it is a matter of fact.	O
I need to make a two of everything that's so that's that's the best way to do it.	O
Click and drag, delete it.	O
Alright foreground.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's connect this uhm?	O
My mum.	CHITCHAT
This is the way back.	O
You gotta name your layer so you know what you're talking about, so alt.	O
Click drag, bang this is going to be back.	O
Bam and then white bent black is gonna also go here, bam.	O
Lock all that, click and drag here and move it over.	O
Aaron S.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh Love it.	CHITCHAT
Now listen, I wanna listen to Wu Tang music because of that theme song from the other game alright COO COO COO COO COO.	CHITCHAT
So forget that and now I'm gonna play with this background lock that.	O
Lock this, grab all of that.	O
Yeah, delete it.	O
Ask around here to here.	O
Oh, somebody says on to main boom.	O
Oh, I see what happened, undo?	O
Uh-huh right there, lock all of that up.	O
Oh, I now click and drag.	O
Oh that's The Shadows Paper Shadow.	O
Where is the table shell desktop live very dense?	O
Delete everything else, bring that back.	O
Down, grab all of this, get rid of it.	O
Boom.	CHITCHAT
Now I don't need the table.	O
Uh Huh.	CHITCHAT
But I and I don't need this.	O
I think that's what I was trying to do.	O
Uh-huh But this table I am going to make it long.	O
So we get the shadows and the table hold on.	O
Uh-huh Yeah, so that way it goes all the way to the edge and then hopefully when depending on the screen size that might match up and then so then you only see the table going all the way across.	O
Eventually I would like to add some things here into the edges in the right and left so that then it shows up to the right and left for the game Design.	O
Alright, That's done.	O
And less like that layer boom an save this as save as version 2.	O
Come on, you want to save your versions in case you decide that you like something before and so you go back to the other version and get it there.	O
It is OK done, got it.	O
Now let's go to the blocks.	O
Is this don't save enough to say?	CHITCHAT
Alright good good good zoom in there we go nice nice nice so now let me show you what I did before before is this.	O
I just did that.	O
Where are you?	CHITCHAT
Where is the red?	O
I think it's down in the bottom.	CHITCHAT
Yeah that's in the bottom So what was on the top?	O
Was up here as it is.	CHITCHAT
Is the blue one?	O
Yep, there it is.	O
Let's go with that.	O
So this is how I did the game pieces for the other game is in layers of course, so let's move it up here.	O
'cause That's bills next, bam.	CHITCHAT
So we have a background square outline square, Wu Tang logo, the chain.	O
I even made a brush of illustrator brush.	O
Of that chain right there so that I can now was just draw the chain.	O
I don't know if it's in this uhm.	CHITCHAT
If it's in here or if he's gone because I close a file, there it is like that.	O
Brush OK there.	O
I crack me up and so those are little tricks and things that you do to create your image is build him up.	O
You build him up so that's the chain.	O
And then here's the guy.	CHITCHAT
So the wu-tang guy and so you know just got a little just a bunch of layers climb on top of each other.	O
That's all that is.	O
OK, so now I really don't.	O
I need this.	O
I need that I don't need any of these.	O
I am going to keep this person because I mean when I use those colors, uh, that's another thing is, I want to make sure all the different.	O

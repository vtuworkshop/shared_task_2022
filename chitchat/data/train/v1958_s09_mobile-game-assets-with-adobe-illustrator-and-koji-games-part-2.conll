What's happening here?	O
OK, let me know.	O
So for that coffee orphans already two o'clock.	O
OK, let's see.	O
Let's try that.	O
Get here.	O
Bone there it is so everything is coming out kind of purple.	O
Desk who no outlines.	O
And I'm going to turn down that pass it a little bit.	O
Let me see dark and.	O
Multiply.	O
And turned it down.	O
But if I did something weird.	O
Oh, that's cool.	O
Little color Dodge.	O
Oh yeah, that's nice.	O
Relaying.	O
I don't use all of these other ones as often.	O
Uh-huh OK, now that I did that, I'm going to.	O
Go one more layer.	O
Less that and now do a little extra details 'cause I like to go a little crazy.	O
It's just my problem.	O
This is my problem, no one else is.	O
I'm on.	O
Why is it trying to control what I draw?	O
I had to keep turning coming back to turn that off Itza.	O
Is it here to see?	O
No, it's all off.	O
You should not be bugging me.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool dark that's it.	O
All right, uhm, some more.	O
Some more here.	O
And some here.	O
But Uh-huh Select that layer.	O
Multiply, bring it down and let's make it a little reddish.	O
There it is COO COO COO.	O
Bring it down some more and there it is.	O
Yeah, we got our shadow boom one more layer.	O
I'm sorry I go crazy with their later.	O
This is why it takes me a long time to do some work because I will play with it, play with it and then I should should have been done.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I don't understand why my anchor points are going where they want to.	O
I need to check those settings.	O
I think as I'm also in the beta version of illustrator, so other things that happened here are not what we're used to.	O
Some things don't work right.	O
There's so many things come into illustrator right now.	O
Very ready very get yourself ready.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Let's make a.	O
Kind of circles here, that's not right.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Don't like that at all?	CHITCHAT
Which is why we got the blonde brush boom boom too thick.	O
3.	O
There we go.	O
That's enough.	O
Select that layer, turn down the Opacity.	O
Let's go less.	O
Bam, there we go.	O
That's it.	O
OK, not happy with how dark this thing is.	O
So let's light in this one out.	O
Let's go there.	O
The yellow.	O
And then select that one and turned out one much down much further down.	O
OK.	O
So this is the art board.	O
All of this is the art board.	O
Art board.	CHITCHAT
Bang Artboard Lock it.	O
Let's do something with this square.	O

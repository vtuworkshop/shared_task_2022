Switch cameras.	O
You know what was really important today on my lights are on yet it's getting dark outside.	O
That's why the lights change.	O
But what I'm trying to get across here today is that.	O
Number one we gotta practice the tools that we have, right?	O
So illustrator a lot of illustrator I've been drawing with illustrator since 2000, one 2002.	O
And once I understood how paths layers anchor points, the pen tool work boom, the whole world.	O
Was open to any, uh, this design is one of my early.	O
Illustrator designs guy little paint is that paint with my clothes on?	O
Will different clothes anyway.	O
So there you go.	O
That's a picture of my grandson.	O
His name is Solomon and then he was two years old and then I did the drawing of his face and uh.	CHITCHAT
It's just amazing to me that you can.	CHITCHAT
You have a program that allows you to just pick up and move the line anytime you want in any direction.	O
Strain it out, curve it out, whatever.	O
That's really cool.	O
The second part is that once we understand and use these tools, we get to explore a creativity and try new things right and get your artwork to different levels.	O
The third part is going to be will work in this artwork live.	O
One thing is to create be created and show it also.	O
Hey look what I drew that's that's that's one step.	CHITCHAT
The other steps like look what I drew an name.	CHITCHAT
Check out the shirts look what I drew Anderson mobile game look what I drew an now on the Billboard as part of a branding campaign has been licensed.	CHITCHAT
I got customers things like that and I so that's to me it was important that I want you to understand.	CHITCHAT
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to the stream because it's almost ready.	CHITCHAT
And so yeah, I think about that I need to write down what I just said, 'cause it sounded really cool and I don't think I said it like that.	CHITCHAT
OK, here we go click here.	O
I do open a new tab.	O
Here it is.	O
Let's go ahead and turn up the volume.	O
There is, yeah.	O
I don't know why don't get so 'cause it's probably coming out on the other side over there alright COO COO COO so let's go boom or there is the sense.	O
I don't know why I didn't hear any sound earlier.	CHITCHAT
And there goes the easels right?	O
The easiest show up.	CHITCHAT
That wasn't good.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, that wasn't good either.	O
But to die there goes the cat that you can see the cap.	O
I'm going to die, is it?	CHITCHAT
I'd I'd do it again.	O
Give me that.	O
Yeah yeah yeah, oh so he's talking to me yes I'm coming.	CHITCHAT
Alright Alright Alright.	O
I need a cool soundtrack.	O
There is a.	O
It was a Samsung Awesome soundtrack in the other game, the original identity, the settings and maybe with just my mind playing tricks on me.	O
But there's the cups of coffee.	O
Come on when it should be excited.	CHITCHAT
Yes you would.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, go ahead and try out Koji made with Koji tryout.	O
Uhm, the templates there's a ton of templates out there if I think.	O
I think I did post on my projects.	O
I'm gonna double check that that link is available to regular public.	O
Oh Man, I messed that up over here talking and then just play.	CHITCHAT
You know, just play with the game see which one you like.	O
Think about the mechanics of it.	O
Does it?	CHITCHAT
Does it feature our style?	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
This is not for tonight we're not building fortnight, you know you want a fortnight go higher EA Sports.	O
A mom or whoever makes it not, and that's not the point.	CHITCHAT
The Who actually makes is not the point.	CHITCHAT
Is the fact that you know these are very simple basic.	O
Games that function as a game in the in in.	O
It's up to you to put a theme on it.	O
That is your job.	CHITCHAT
Your job is to put a theme on it and once you put a theme on it, you share it with the world.	O
You tell the world you know what it is that you're doing, how you did it.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe do a live stream is ahead.	CHITCHAT

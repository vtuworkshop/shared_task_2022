Hey guys were back.	CHITCHAT
Sorry for the issues, were having some trouble getting connected to the server, but hopefully we're going to stay connected.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to try this is I know it's a little tough to watch the stream like this, but we're going to try our best to get some time to hang out together.	CHITCHAT
An yeah if it shuts down again then maybe I will take a break for the day.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll try streaming again and a few hours but I think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but I'm going to try to do is will go through now and hopefully be able to continue smoothly.	CHITCHAT
But if it shuts down I will probably stay stay offline.	CHITCHAT
And if you want to hear any updates about if I'll be going live again or not, you can check my Twitter or my discord.	CHITCHAT
The link to my discord should be in the the description.	CHITCHAT
Below the stream and so you can keep in touch there about when I'll be going live.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hey, I cash it's I'm having trouble connecting.	CHITCHAT
There's some issues going on with the I think might be issues going on with the hand server.	CHITCHAT
Everything seems OK with My Internet but you never know there's a lot of variables so sometimes these things happen.	CHITCHAT
It's live stream problems.	CHITCHAT
It happens, but no we were not purposely ending the stream here.	CHITCHAT
This is not supposed to be happening.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so let's continue with the painting and hopefully will get through it again if I if I do shut down again, I'm probably going to end it there.	CHITCHAT
And you can check out my socials for updates on if we're going to be streaming again later today or not, and otherwise otherwise, we'll just.	CHITCHAT
We'll just call it for the day.	CHITCHAT
I know it's hard for everyone to watch like this, so.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I do.	CHITCHAT
I do also stream on Twitch Cornell.	CHITCHAT
Actually I stream here and be hands every Wednesday and I stream some other days on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
I also stream traditional art so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's get back into it.	O
If anybody is painting along, I hope it's going well and I hope your hope you're enjoying your painting.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's see where were we?	CHITCHAT
We're working on for me what I'm doing right now is working on values, so I turned my painting into black and white and took a peek there an so that gave me some hints on what I need to work on.	O
Also down here at the where the garden and the dirt kind of meets up.	O
I want a little bit more of a gradual.	O
Thing going on down there like I want to add some little little patches of dirt or little patches of shadow.	O
It just seems right now.	O
Is it?	CHITCHAT
Abrupt end?	O
So we'll try to get this one spruced up, so I'm adding some shadows shadows under the.	O
Under the Bush is shadows under the stairway.	O
Bring in some of the darker values finally.	O
There is also a rail I'll do this on another layer.	O
There's a railing.	O
It's also really bright nice.	O
Bright light hitting there.	O
And so this is all on its own layer, so it's nice 'cause we can apply either a clipping mask or we can use a lock transparency.	O
So I'm going to go to the checkerboard icon, press that down, and now I can paint any color that I want.	O

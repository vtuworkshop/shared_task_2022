I can make these this railing any color that I want, so I'm going to use a little bit of A.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Little bit of a shadow, a little bit of an off white color.	O
Maybe a little bit towards blue.	O
Might be pretty.	CHITCHAT
Welcome back Anthony.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that, sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you found your way back.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we've got our stairway and it's casting a little bit of a shadow onto the.	O
The stairs.	O
And do something like this.	O
Do you do?	CHITCHAT
I think that's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
And then this meets up with the road.	O
So if you guys have any questions about anything I'm doing, welcome to let me know.	CHITCHAT
Going to flip the canvas over here and I'll flip my reference whenever I flip the canvas.	O
I'm also flipping my reference on the other monitor.	O
So it's really hard to do that without flipping.	O
It's really hard to like.	O
Just envision the reference flipped so I do flip it.	O
I'm I'm not flipping, flipping the little thumbnail up top.	O
But I am flipping the reference on my other monitor.	O
So at this stage in the painting, I feel like we can get the idea.	O
Now it starts to come together.	O
The look that you get from this kind of Workflow.	O
It's starting to starting to finally come together earlier on in the process.	O
It's very messy with this whole sort of traditional style doing under painting, painting over it, having all that orange showing.	O
Even now there's still a lot of orange showing that we got to tone down, but I think we're starting to get to the phase where you can see.	O
Some of the benefits of it.	O
We can see that it's.	O
It's becoming cleaner and it has a nice look, but it takes it takes a little while.	O
To get to this stage so you gotta like just have faith in the early stages that you're going to get here.	O
Bring a brighter color green.	O
Looking like individual leaves on this.	O
This Bush here.	O
More detail.	O
Can turn on color dynamics a little bit more dramatic.	O
We'll get some interesting colors and some lighter colors that look like light shining off the leaves.	O
You can get pretty bright.	O
You can put almost a white to show the idea of light shining off leaves 'cause they can be really reflective.	O
And I see some warm color too in that Bush.	O
Maybe it's Flowers, maybe it's little little twigs or some Brown leaves.	O
I mean, I don't know, but it gives a nice variation.	O
Alright, this little area needs a little bit of love.	CHITCHAT
We've got shadows here.	O
Purple shadows, that's where the.	O
The mailbox is going to be oh you guys.	O
At some point I accidentally merged down my sketch layer so the sketch is now a permanent part of the painting that wasn't on purpose, but Luckily I had my sketch layer at such a low opacity is it doesn't really make a difference.	O
That's actually something that I do purposely when I'm painting portraits.	O

When I'm painting portraits, I do like to merge my sketch layer onto the painting.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
That's an option of a workflow.	O
Well, we're doing it here now.	O
The other spin the image of an angle to make strokes or lines easier to draw.	O
I do not I know that that's a really common thing to do an I got out of the habit of doing it.	CHITCHAT
So part of the reason is before he started live streaming, I used to instead of live streaming.	CHITCHAT
I would.	CHITCHAT
I would record tutorial videos that kind of pre recorded process videos and one of the things that I notice, twas it would be really annoying to watch for people that were trying to watch the sped up video when the image was like moving around so much.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean when you're going to update it and stuff like that when you speed up.	CHITCHAT
A video like that it gets really crazy, like in real time it's no problem, but when you speed it up it looks a little wild, so I used to.	CHITCHAT
I so I got out of the habit of using that because of those videos making those videos and now I never do it anymore like I just never got out of the habit of it.	CHITCHAT
I never think to do it for me.	CHITCHAT
Flipping the canvas horizontally is like enough.	CHITCHAT
I never need to turn it this way or that way.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
Ryan, the sketch layer that's so funny.	CHITCHAT
It's no problem, though, you know.	CHITCHAT
Average over the schedule later.	CHITCHAT
Yes, please.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, sketches now with us forever.	CHITCHAT
Whether we like it or not, this Calculator is here to stay.	CHITCHAT
Those are funny.	CHITCHAT
That's the thing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah so anyway.	CHITCHAT
Got another pipe coming down here.	O
You can use shift to make a straight line.	O
Sometimes I have to do that 'cause I can't draw a straight line.	O
Here we go.	O
I really like using purple and shadows when it's a nice sunny day.	O
Think it's really pretty.	CHITCHAT
They've got a couple little say utility.	O
Pipes and things.	O
Random little box, some kind of meter.	O
I kind of like drawing in these little details.	CHITCHAT
I know that they're not always most aesthetic, but it overall gives an impression that somebody lives here, you know.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	O
Let's bring some of these on a new layer, which I will not merge down yet, be careful.	O
We're going to bring some of these.	O
Wires here and there.	O
On the roof.	O
Different in Denison thicknesses of the wires.	O
Some coming over here.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And we'll have to decide if we want to include all of them.	O
I mean, maybe it's a little bit much.	O
Kind of a lot, actually.	O
So I like the idea of making these two little closer together up at the top rather than having one of them actually cut down in front of the house.	O
I think maybe that's a little bit nicer.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Will do that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
You are a like how you can make a pretty plainish reference into your really beautiful painting.	CHITCHAT
Your colors and plants look very appealing.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's really nice to hear.	CHITCHAT

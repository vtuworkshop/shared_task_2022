And we have to add the Flowers and still.	O
So we have that to look forward to.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll get into that now.	CHITCHAT
Hey red welcome, sorry about that, welcome back.	O
Welcome in.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some Flowers that will be nice.	O
So yeah, we can.	CHITCHAT
One thing I'll do real quick before that is one of these wires up here.	O
We actually get like a pretty strong light hitting the wire, so while that's on its own layer will come down like this.	O
And add that highlight.	O
I find those kind of things really satisfying and it makes.	O
Makes the wire really feel 3D really pops out towards us without light hitting so.	O
I think that.	CHITCHAT
We could also get a.	O
Pretty bright detail on top of the house here.	O
Go to control Z for that perfect brush strokes.	O
There we go.	O
Alright, will merge those.	O
And new layer for the Flowers.	O
All right, these are going to be really pretty.	CHITCHAT
We're going to really bright magenta, really bright.	O
We might start with, yet we'll start with this color.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Just paint little flower groups and almost looks unreal bright.	O
But I mean, hey, that's what they look like.	O
There's also some climbing up the wall here.	O
I forgot to draw those little leaves will add them in.	O
So that we can explain those Flowers, there's some down here.	O
I don't know if they're all the same kind of plant, but these guys are everywhere.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
And up here tons of long now these are bit further away so you can kind of just make one brush stroke for a group of Flowers.	O
And we're going to give some different variation of color too.	O
I don't think it needs much 'cause they're really bright and kind of.	O
Yeah, there's not too many different variations, but for example will go a little bit darker.	O
Darker and cooler add some shadows so around the bigger groups or in the area where there's like a darker green we can imagine that there would be Flowers in shadow there so we can use this darker color.	O
And then maybe we can make it brighter color.	O
So color pic again from the original magenta and let's go a little bit brighter.	O
Might be a stupid question.	CHITCHAT
What kind of brush are using here for blending?	CHITCHAT
Um, I'm not sure what I was doing when you ask me that question.	CHITCHAT
If you're talking about the Flowers.	O
I'm using a rectangle texture brush that I've made.	O
The one that was what was I doing before?	O
I'm not sure what I was doing.	CHITCHAT
When you may have asked that.	CHITCHAT
But You can let me know if I was painting a specific thing.	CHITCHAT
I'll try to answer it, but I'm using these custom brushes that I've been working on that I will make available as soon as I can as soon as they're ready.	O
I want to make a little tutorial video to go along with them so.	CHITCHAT
It's taking a little time, but.	CHITCHAT
They will be available soon.	CHITCHAT
Try to remember what I was doing right before that.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I'm using a.	CHITCHAT
There's a brush that similar to this one in the free brush back that you can download for me below the stream in the description it's called.	O
It's called the rectangle texture brush.	O
There's a very similar brush to this in that in that pack.	O
If you're looking for something that will do the job, this will be very similar.	O
So I'm going to select this group of Flowers here on the left.	O
I don't know if my eyes are just.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I'm imagining this, but I feel like those Flowers are a little bit more towards red, like a little bit more towards red, orange and then these over here more magenta.	O
I just seen that, so I'm going to.	O
Q shift them a tiny bit.	O
And I also want to add a brighter green.	O
I feel like these Flowers are standing out as being like super super bright compared to the Bush.	O
The color of the plant that they're coming out of.	O
So I want to add some brighter green so I feel like the lighting makes more sense.	O
But I am like concerned that those Flowers in the Bush I want them to match the rest of the painting.	O

So you're gradually changing the colors to blend them in, yes, So what I'm doing is.	O
If I'm trying to blend colors like let's say I want to blend from a darker green 2 liter green, then I will.	O
You can do this with absolutely any brush, but what I'll do is you know kind of color pic from the color and then sort of overlap them and just kind of keep doing that because I'm using a brush with transfer so the brush isn't painting at 100%.	O
It's going a little bit see through so when you overlap the brush with the colour it's going to give you, then sort of a mix of the two and then you can color pick that and put that over there and kind of.	O
Keep overlapping them.	O
This only works if your brushes has transfer.	O
If you're using 100% opacity brush then you're just going to keep doing this and covering each other and that doesn't blend.	O
But if you use transfer then you're going to be lightly overlapping the colors until you get a blend.	O
So this is how I blend.	O
If you want a really, really smooth blend, then you can use even softer brushes than what I'm doing.	O
You can use a brush that's like a.	O
An airbrush or something I used to use the airbrush alot for blending before I started getting into these textured looks.	O
I used to use the airbrush constantly for that.	O
And as it works really well.	O
I see is the airbrush to block in to start with a blend and then I would go and paint on top.	O
In add texture so that works too.	O
So right now I'm adding a little bit more texture to the top of these Bush is.	O
Yeah, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
No problem.	CHITCHAT
So I want this feeling of dirt and dust and little tiny pebbles and stuff, so I'm using a brush with a lot of noisy texture.	O
Where I feel that we're almost done with this one.	O
There's a few more things that are missing that I want to get in.	O
One is over on the right.	O
Things are a bit messy and I want to paint in.	O
The that there's a plant that I want to paint in.	O
All these kinds of crazy leaves.	O
So I want to get a new color green.	O
Yeah, something bright like this, maybe not quite that bright.	O
And.	O
Paint some of these.	O
I don't know what you would call this kind of plant.	CHITCHAT
But Amazing how Flowers can bring so much life in a painting.	O
It's true as sometimes I like to add little wild Flowers to scenes that don't originally have them.	CHITCHAT
Who's to say where little Flowers can be?	CHITCHAT
You can just add them where you want and it adds a little bit extra cheerfulness.	O
Alright, I'm going to take a look at Reds link.	CHITCHAT
Ended up drawing another one from yesterday.	CHITCHAT
Stream, let's see.	CHITCHAT
All Cute.	CHITCHAT
This is a little sketch pen sketch from red Fox in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Nicely done.	CHITCHAT
I want to paint this one, maybe will do it in the upcoming.	CHITCHAT
In an upcoming stream, maybe will do that one.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you for sharing.	CHITCHAT
So I need to add some explanation for why these Flowers are just randomly up here.	CHITCHAT
So let's.	CHITCHAT
Let's work on having this little plant pop up behind the other one.	O
With some leaves.	O
Adding a couple more little cute little plants different.	O

Circular kind of bushy shapes, and then you gotta plant.	O
You can just make a little.	O
Little sphere.	O
At a later green on the top and you gotta push.	O
Little sphere, little Dome.	O
Add some later color on the top.	O
We got a cute little Bush.	O
I'm going to try again at that plant.	O
I was trying to paint earlier.	O
Wasn't really working.	O
Let's try one more time, so we want these.	O
He's kind of arched shapes.	O
And they have light hitting, so some of them are brighter than others.	O
Some of them come out higher up.	O
And I think that gives a nice look to the garden overall, just a variety of types of plants.	O
That's pretty cute.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we've got some overlap, so I'm bringing some darker green.	O
And we'll go back with a lighter one more time.	O
So depending on how detailed you want to get, we could go in and.	O
Do more with those, but I think that's going to be fine.	O
Maybe I'll put a little bit of shadow underneath.	O
We could also put a little highlight on on some of the leaves.	O
So leaves can be really shiny, so if you want to pick the area that's curved and add a little highlight that will make the leaf look shiny.	O
Thanks, Red is strange now that I'm more afraid to do digital scenes than traditional.	CHITCHAT
I wonder why, but it's so cool you're getting that comfortable with traditional.	CHITCHAT
But I wonder why?	CHITCHAT
Hey, just remember you can always make a new layer.	O
It's not too scary.	O
You can always change things.	O
So one thing that I haven't really done yet in this scene is a mess with any.	O
Layer blending modes or anything.	O
But I still like to use those tools even when I'm going for a traditional look.	O
I just usually most of the time I end up using them kind of around a bit the end as like a way to tweak things.	O
Thank you, thank you Mail.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I just remembered this one more plant that I've kind of excluded over here.	O
We don't want to do that.	O
Let's paint this little guy in.	O
Little leaves here and there and then we've got more of an orangey kind of flower.	O
I mean, I could definitely go overboard with these and just start adding like tons of Flowers of every color and different plants.	CHITCHAT
You can really just go over the top, but.	CHITCHAT
Try not to go too crazy.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to merge everything down.	O
If we're going to talk finishing touches and things.	O
Loving the weighted pink Flowers and the bottom left thank you.	O
Nice contrast you.	O
Raffi, good to see you, thanks.	CHITCHAT

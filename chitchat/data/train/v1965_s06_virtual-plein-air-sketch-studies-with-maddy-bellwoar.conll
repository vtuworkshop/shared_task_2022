Trying to see if there's anything else I should add in.	O
I mean we could, like I said it's we could go on.	CHITCHAT
We could go on with these plants but.	O
For finishing things, what I usually do is go to my.	O
Adjustment layers so that I'll be over here.	O
On my layers palette oh have to start this again after I restarted.	O
Whoops, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Ah, OK, so.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Adjustment layers you can go to little half circle icon and.	O
Let's try.	CHITCHAT
Let's try the levels.	O
So this will be good for messing with values.	O
We can see if we want the darker shadows to be darker.	O
If we want the midtones to be lighter or darker, you can mess with all kinds of things can really change the mood of your painting.	O
Do you want the?	CHITCHAT
The lights to be brighter, so usually I'll come in here and a lot of times I end up adding a little bit of extra.	O
Contrast.	O
Sometimes will lower the Opacity gets a little too much.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Prefer digital, so I don't know what I'm feeling.	CHITCHAT
This kind of like mistakes in traditional.	CHITCHAT
Just don't look so off to me.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, I know I know what you mean I've been.	CHITCHAT
I've been going for like as you know, I've been going for more of this traditional looking my digital.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's something to do with that I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Now the other filters that I like to use or the other adjustment layers would be color balance.	O
I like to go through these sliders from Shadows, Midtones and highlights, and sometimes I change nothing, but other times I do so you can see the mood, the difference in mood.	O
If you want to go with more red or magenta and the shadows, you can make it feel like it's more in midday, or you can make it feel like it's almost sunset if you go with a really warm glow, there's so much you can do and really change or.	O
Exaggerate the mood in your painting.	O
Whatever you were going for, so.	O
I like to go through this sometimes if I feel like I'm stuck even halfway through a painting.	O
If I feel like I'm not getting the results I want, sometimes I'll come in here and mess with one of these adjustment layers and make some adjustments there and then continue with my painting.	O
So sometimes it will help break me away from a from being stuck if I'm stuck.	O
But let's let's take a look.	CHITCHAT
What that looks like before an after, so I didn't really change a ton.	O
It's a little bit warmer maybe.	O
Do you have a favorite type of flower?	CHITCHAT
Oh, that stuff.	CHITCHAT
As tough.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, my favorite type of flower dip paint is kind of the ones that we painted in this image.	CHITCHAT
'cause I just feel like there so fun and easy to just paint little dabs with your brush like dot dot dot and it looks like Flowers so I like painting Flowers from that perfect distance where you can just put a little paint stroke and it looks like a flower that's so like fun and easy to paint.	CHITCHAT
These cheerful little Flowers so I like that, but my favorite type of flower might be a big fan of lavender.	CHITCHAT
I have lavender in my garden.	CHITCHAT
It's not.	CHITCHAT
Really time for it quite yet, but I love how it looks at how it smells and all the bees and butterflies that come.	CHITCHAT
So lavender is probably my favorite.	CHITCHAT
I had to choose one.	CHITCHAT
So I also like selective color.	O
Selective color is kind of similar to the color balance, only it's even more powerful.	O
You can select the individual colors here and then within that color range you can decide to you know, for example, within the Reds in the scene, I can go more or less cyan within those red, so you can really boost up your colors, change the moods, same kind of thing is I was saying before but you can edit your painting quite a lot through these through the selective color you can really change things without going in and repainting.	O
Stuff is really powerful so.	O
This can help a lot in getting the right colors in the right mood.	O
If you feel like you're not having good luck picking your colors right off the bat and having them be exactly what you're imagining, you can try selective color to modify what you've got.	O
And yeah, I really like it.	CHITCHAT
So I don't always go through all these sliders, but sometimes I will.	O
Sometimes I'll just go through all the colors and see if I can see if I find any, discover anything cool, and then I always look at the before and after.	O
Make sure I like it, 'cause sometimes sometimes I end up liking the original better and sometimes I'll turn the painting to black and white and do like a value comparison and make sure I'm not doing anything to funky.	O
Value Wise, but if we do the before and after this is before this is after 4 after so it is a bit brighter.	O

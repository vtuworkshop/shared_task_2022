One thing that you can do is go and Mascouten area.	O
So I do like the extra bright NIS but I would like the bottom of the canvas to be darker.	O
So what I'll do is choose a black, go to the mask, click on the mask and paint with black so that will get rid of the adjustment in that area.	O
So you can bring it back in if you want by painting it in with white.	O
So this is a nice way to edit your painting in a non destructive manner, because these are you can go back and change these and take them away and it doesn't modify original painting, but I don't care about that right now so I'm going to merge them all down.	O
Yeah, I am actually a huge fan of the Witcher.	CHITCHAT
I played the.	CHITCHAT
Games two and three and recently like over the Holidays I replayed the Witcher 3.	CHITCHAT
I kind of wish I did it now 'cause this would be a good time to replay it, but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I absolutely love.	CHITCHAT
I've painted a couple screenshots from the game.	CHITCHAT
For this type of study, maybe will do, maybe will be more of that.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's move this back over here.	O
So the last thing I'll do is some sort of like manual adjustments and things.	O
So for example.	O
Make a new layer, put it on multiply.	O
And choose let's just choose like a medium Gray.	O
And that and then come through and decide where we might want things to be a little bit darker and just add that extra little bit of shadow work on the values.	O
Little bit maybe in the background.	O
These these shadow should a bit darker.	O
And then I'll make a new layer and kind of the opposite.	O
Put the layer on color Dodge.	O
I like to double click the layer an uncheck the transparency shapes layer.	O
That will make the color Dodge behave just a little bit differently, and I kind of prefer it's a little bit more saturation.	O
And it will lower the Opacity and just take a big airbrush and find some places where you imagine the light is hitting most strongly and just do a little lick dab of the airbrush there.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
So before or after, if you feel like things are getting too over exposed, you can just lower the opacity a little bit.	O
I'm going to go back to the shadow layer and.	O
I have a little bit more shadow to this building.	O
Thoughts on the Witcher?	CHITCHAT
Netflix show?	CHITCHAT
I enjoyed it.	CHITCHAT
I enjoyed it.	CHITCHAT
I was happy to have some more Witcher content in my life.	CHITCHAT
I thought that Henry Cavill was amazing.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
To me it was a.	CHITCHAT
It was a bit.	CHITCHAT
It was different than the games and I know that that's yeah they were basing the show off of the books, so there were going to be some differences in interpretations.	CHITCHAT
Overall, I really enjoyed it.	CHITCHAT
I didn't love everything.	CHITCHAT
There were some of the some of the things I just.	CHITCHAT
I was so used to the games that I kind of craved for certain things to be more similar.	CHITCHAT
Like certain characters looking different.	CHITCHAT
This and that it was just kind of like it took some getting used to for me.	CHITCHAT
Overall I liked it.	CHITCHAT
And so I have a lot of friends that are like really obsessed with it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not quite on that level, but I was happy.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, I was just happy to have some more with your content and it was really well done.	CHITCHAT
Overall.	CHITCHAT
So I'll be looking for looking forward to more.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well I could probably like Tweek this for awhile, but I think I'm going to call it done with those final adjustments.	O
For merge things down in Metairie, so a little bit more of this shadow if you want to too much.	O
But Yeah, Alright will merge that down.	O
So that was our first one.	O
I can zoom in so we can take a closer look.	O
So you see that the perspective is a little bit different than the reference.	O
Not all the details are there, but I focus on the things I like the Flowers, the nice lighting.	O
We left out some of the like.	O
There's some lights and wires and things that we left out, some little rocks and things.	O
If I was going to spend more time on this, I'd probably work on the doors and window.	O
There bit loose and then the area down here could use some work, but I think it's fine for the amount of time we're doing here.	O
The book story and game story isn't the same story at all.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm I have read a little bit of I read like half of the last wish and then I was actually going.	CHITCHAT
I was moving at the time so I kind of ran out of time to read it and I never picked it back up again, but.	CHITCHAT

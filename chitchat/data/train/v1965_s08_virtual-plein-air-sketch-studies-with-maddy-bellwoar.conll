Yeah, I could tell even from a little bit there there was a bit different, but yeah, that's what happens.	CHITCHAT
My original introduction to this.	CHITCHAT
The story was through the games, so even if it's not the 100% accurate, it still like this story that I have most of my heart, you know.	CHITCHAT
Which character from the game do you prefer?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Well, Geralt's, my favorite, but I was always on Team Triss.	CHITCHAT
I have to admit the 3rd so I start.	CHITCHAT
I played the second one first so I was kind of had a soft spot for Triss because she was more like the Main.	CHITCHAT
Lady in that game and then yeah in the Witcher 3 I also got a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
I like Jen too.	CHITCHAT
I'm not like Anti one of them but I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I kind of trees is kind of my favorite because of that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
OK guys, let's go on to the next one shall we?	CHITCHAT
If anybody was painting along or sketching along and you want to share what you did, you're welcome too.	CHITCHAT
If you need more time, that's cool, but whenever you want, you can post a link in the chat to your artwork.	CHITCHAT
If you did a sketch of this, the next one we're going to do is right here.	CHITCHAT
This is the reference, so it's going to be all natural one.	O
No buildings, we can relax, play with colors.	O
I think it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
This effect is like blue effect.	O
I know it's maybe a little bit overdone, but in this photo, but I don't care.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Love it.	CHITCHAT
OK so I'm going to share this reference above.	O
The chat and info tab let me add it there.	CHITCHAT
If you want the exact crop that I'm going to be using, if you want a 360 view that's already in the description below, stream, it's the second one, second link.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we've got our little mini.	O
View appear like that little smaller.	O
And I will put this on the other monitor.	O
Hey fish in good to see you, thank you thank you.	CHITCHAT
Looks beautiful, Mattie might take alright.	CHITCHAT
Let me check it out Jackson and thank you.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Your perspective is always like, so right on, this really feels like the more correct angle to the reference, then why I ended up with really solid Jackson.	O
That's beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Yeah guys, check this out.	CHITCHAT
I also I like your composition more of a square.	O
I'm definitely fat square composition.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to go for that with the next one that we're doing.	O
Yeah, I really really nice.	CHITCHAT
Love the colors in these Flowers and some of those lost edges.	CHITCHAT
We've got some crispness and some sort of blurred effect to those that's really satisfying.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this works well as like a focal point for me.	CHITCHAT
Very pretty.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for painting with me, Jackson and if anybody else wants to, you can grab the reference and paint along.	CHITCHAT
So I'm moving over here.	O
We're going to work on a little bit more of a square composition.	O
The reference is a bit more elongated than what I have here, but I think I'm just going to work with this.	O
And again, I'm going to try to do this in around an hour.	CHITCHAT
We had some tech issues, so I feel like I'm a little bit behind on my schedule, but we're going to try to catch up here on this one, 'cause I think this one will have a little bit of a chance to do that because it's there's no buildings and crazy stuff.	CHITCHAT
So fingers crossed, but let's start with the start with the sketch.	CHITCHAT
Hi Sean.	CHITCHAT
Thank you fish and I'm doing good.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good.	CHITCHAT
About to paint.	CHITCHAT
Some of my favorite settings for me.	CHITCHAT
This kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
A little pathway through the forest.	CHITCHAT
This is like some of my favorite type of scene to paint.	CHITCHAT
In the world, so I'm happy.	CHITCHAT
So I like the feeling of it going away into the distance, so I want to make sure we have a pathway that begins very small and narrow and gets bigger coming towards us.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Something like this?	CHITCHAT
And then we've got next to that little bit of dirt.	O
And then next to that and got all the plants.	O
All the plants got a little bit of a higher ro of Bush is or trees here.	O
Same thing on the other side.	O
Oh no, you don't like painting leaves.	CHITCHAT
Read says what makes me laugh is the community started by blaming the cast of Henry Cavill to play girl, then ended up putting him in God Stand 'cause he's good.	CHITCHAT

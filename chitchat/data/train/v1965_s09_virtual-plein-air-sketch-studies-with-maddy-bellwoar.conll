Yeah, I guess people didn't think he could pull it off but he really did.	CHITCHAT
He really did.	CHITCHAT
He deserves all the praise.	CHITCHAT
Haha right fish.	CHITCHAT
Oh man yeah, it's good to see you guys.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're going to keep these these plants pretty soft and fluffy.	O
And then we're going to have some stand out against the massive green and they have their own little more unique identities, so that's going to be this tree right here.	O
The little arm reaching out like that.	O
I've got some random ones.	O
This tree over here actually let's do this one first, 'cause this one is in the foreground.	O
Kind of overlaps the other.	O
So like this, maybe we can even go out more of an extreme angle, so I'm going to select what I drew, go to edit, transform, skew so this will let me just tilt it like that.	O
Super handy.	O
Don't have to repaint anything.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I used the transform tools a lot in my sketching.	O
I'd like to sketch a perfect the first time, but it's not always the case.	O
Got the other tree here matching up alright.	O
And then on this side, we've got some unique plants too, so we've got one palm tree that comes up over here.	O
Yeah, Yeah Ryan, he's someone that would be good to do.	CHITCHAT
A portrait study of he's got very like strong facial features.	CHITCHAT
That would be a good choice.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we've got our palm tree with a sketch in roughly the area of the palm fronds will take up, so something like this.	O
And then some other over here, so I'm just sketching in like the outline of where I want to paint these plants within.	O
I'm not necessarily going to sketch the plants when we paid, the plants were going to make them look.	O
More like the plant with leaves and stuff, but I'm just trying to get a feel for where their placements going to be.	O
Over here we've got some branches kind of coming in from the side more close up to us, so we've got these big leaves that's going to be nice.	O
Yeah, OK, so I tried to fit this in.	O
The reference has a little bit of different of a composition than what I've done here, so I'm trying to like.	O
Make that work.	O
I think it's.	CHITCHAT
I think it's good.	O
So will merge everything together.	O
Bring that pulled over like this.	O
Think we're ready to go so there's one thing that I forgot that I did last time.	O
It worked pretty well so I had merged this painting on the left over onto the background layer what I'm going to do is go to layer new layer via copy and put that on its own layer and just lock that layer so no matter what I'm not going to accidentally destroy this painting on the left so we can preserve it.	O
Just to be safe.	O
Hi, our age welcome and thank you.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have any questions let me know.	CHITCHAT
We're going to begin the new one right now.	CHITCHAT
So see where is the best place to put this?	O
Trying to show as much of my paintings possible?	CHITCHAT
Alright new layer and what should we choose is an underpainting for this one.	O
I wonder if we should go for a similar color, so I'm looking on the ground that warm colour maybe will go with something a little bit more pink.	O
I've been trying to experiment with different underpainting colors, but I find that in a sunny environment I tend to use kind of the same thing over and over again, but seems to work for me.	O
But let's go a little bit more pink.	O
See if we could get more of a tropical feeling in this.	O
So this is just so that we can start off with.	O
We don't want a white background, we want something that's a little bit more midrange value wise, so something that's not too too dark or too light.	O
And like we could go a little bit darker if we want to actually think through.	O
What the value structure of the scene is going to look like?	O
It's going to be something like this.	O
All thank you foster.	CHITCHAT
Welcome back, sorry about the tech things.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like the results.	CHITCHAT
Highclere welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome alright.	CHITCHAT
So we've got our underpainting.	O
Let's try to keep this one extra loose for the sake of.	O
For the sake of time, and you know, playing with style, so will try to keep it loose.	O

I'm going to take the sketch layer, put it on multiply mode, and lower the opacity.	O
That will make it easier to see through, and I'm going to lock the layer at around 20% opacity somewhere around there, and then we're going to paint underneath that layer and just use it as a guide.	O
Fished in by the way, I've noticed you sketch some paintings, some not.	CHITCHAT
Is that just because of what you feel like doing or do you sketch the harder ones?	CHITCHAT
Yes, good question.	CHITCHAT
I absolutely do that.	CHITCHAT
Lock it down right?	CHITCHAT
Ryan lives will have any accidents already we had did that once today.	CHITCHAT
Oh cool, thank you for letting me know Claire Claire Z.	CHITCHAT
You can you can go into your settings and change that here if you would prefer to.	CHITCHAT
It's it's up to you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, efficient.	CHITCHAT
I usually what I do is I.	CHITCHAT
It depends on how comfortable I feel with the situation with the like.	CHITCHAT
If there's if there's buildings.	CHITCHAT
If I feel like the scene is complicated, all those kinds of things will encourage me to do a sketch first, but sometimes I'm feeling confident or I think that the scene would be a cool one to try just going in with shapes, so I'll do that.	CHITCHAT
But a lot of times I most of the time I think I sketch.	CHITCHAT
Ahead of time sometimes, I guess I'm feeling confident and I'll try not doing it.	CHITCHAT
All thank you clever.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for looking and listening in.	CHITCHAT
I hope your work is going well.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to figure out what to do.	O
First, you guys and I feel a little bit.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit overwhelming trying to decide that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm imagining that going dark to light would be good.	O
So usually I like to do the background first so you know what.	O
Let's just stick to my normal workflow whenever I get confused, I just say you know what?	O
Let's go back to back to basics.	O
Let's go back to the normal thing.	O
Don't get confused that this little bit of a different composition here, so I was thinking, oh maybe we'll start here there.	O
Now, let's start with the Sky.	O
Let's start with the Sky.	CHITCHAT
Then we'll decide what we want to do.	O
So I'm going a little bit more of an Aqua Sky, a little bit more teal.	O
This time.	O
And then we'll make a layer on top of that.	O
For, let's begin with the plants.	O
Oh, there you go?	CHITCHAT
Yeah clears.	CHITCHAT
It's updated, at least for me.	O
I can see.	CHITCHAT
Fish, and there's also the thing where every once in awhile I just kind of forget and then I start painting and then I'm like Oh yeah, I didn't sketch.	CHITCHAT
No idea why that happens sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Pretty weird.	CHITCHAT
OK?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, we're going to we're going to do first this medium.	O
Well, it's pretty bright actually, but.	O
We're going to do a medium ish green sure RH.	O
I'm using a Wakeham Centriq 22.	O
I'll type it in the chat for you.	CHITCHAT
If that's easier to see it.	CHITCHAT
It's the it's the 22 not the 22 HD.	O
Alright, I will get a little bit of a gradient to this, but I want to get a tropical feeling so I'm going to focus on taking inspiration from the colors of the reference, but may be shifting it a little bit more to fit this kind of vibe.	O
So over on the right, things are more in shadow over.	O
Also we can shift are Green a little bit darker.	O
Yeah, you're welcome, alright.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just trying to block in the basics.	O
I don't want to get too detailed into anything until there at least everything is blocked in in the scene.	O
So for example before we start doing anymore foliage, I'm going to work on the ground and add the shadows going across the middle.	O
Jackson says this kind.	CHITCHAT
This kind of rough feels overwhelming for me too.	CHITCHAT
It's like I struggle to understand what's going on at all.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad to hear that is also wondering why I was like I was so excited to paint this one.	CHITCHAT
'cause I love this kind of environment and then I'm sitting here like where do I start?	CHITCHAT
Clearly says I'm so guilty of not sketching.	CHITCHAT
I kind of dislike the sketching process and just getting stuck in probably very bad habit.	CHITCHAT
Not necessarily.	CHITCHAT
It depends on what works well for you, so it's only bad if you feel like.	CHITCHAT
It's hurting your painting somehow.	CHITCHAT

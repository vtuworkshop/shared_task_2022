I think it's OK to do some sort of a compromise where you sketch a loose plan of things.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you're not enjoying getting stuck in like a sort of a line art phase where you're like deciding every detail but just a rough sketch can be nice, just a little bit of just to plan out the basic composition and then go for it.	O
Let's see, Ryan says, do you think you tend to like the outcome of onesie sketch over the ones you don't?	CHITCHAT
Or can you not see the difference?	CHITCHAT
I I wonder, actually I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
I I wonder if I went back and kind of assess them the results.	CHITCHAT
I I don't know that there is one I prefer, I think that.	CHITCHAT
When I don't sketch, it does have a chance to look more painterly, which is often something I'm going for.	CHITCHAT
What I've noticed OK, so one thing I have noticed is if I don't sketch then the beginning part of the painting.	CHITCHAT
Can look really, really really rough because sometimes I'll just try to start without any guidelines and things will be.	CHITCHAT
Things will be not looking great.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
And it takes awhile to work up to something that looks better.	CHITCHAT
But oftentimes I do like the results.	CHITCHAT
It looks more painterly, looks more more traditional ish, kind of.	CHITCHAT
So you kind of have to.	CHITCHAT
There's like that.	CHITCHAT
Balance.	CHITCHAT
A sketch really gives you something to go off of so that you're not like.	CHITCHAT
Coming up with wild stuff, you know, like proportions of things for me.	CHITCHAT
Realize there was a dog in the previous one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah there was.	CHITCHAT
I know what kind of cop down and didn't draw the dog.	CHITCHAT
I really like the effect of the striping of the shadows going across.	O
We can see the individual trees.	O
Tree shapes.	O
So let's get a lighter color for the sidewalk where it's getting hit by light.	O
Not quite sure what color I want to go with.	CHITCHAT
So that.	CHITCHAT
But I want to start blocking in some of this.	O
This is probably 1 where it's going to be important to look at the painting in black-and-white because there's a lot of tricky value things here.	O
So for example, I want there to be highlights that come across the dirt, so they're going to be on the dirt and they're going to be on the.	O
The path and they need to look.	O
Similar in value when you look in black and white.	O
But in the painting they need to make sense that the dirt highlights are going to be warmer.	O
'cause something Brown is being illuminated on the.	O
The pathway is going to be cooler because something great is being illuminated, but it's still roughly the same amount of brightness.	O
Is the goal something that might have worked really well for this is to just paint the just paint the thing and it's whatever shadow color, and then add use like color, Dodge or something like that to do the lighting that could have worked.	O
Let me show another workflow and we'll see.	O
Maybe I'll even use that instead.	CHITCHAT
If it turns out really great.	CHITCHAT
But so for example.	CHITCHAT
For example, if I.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let's get that flat color for the pathway real quick and will get that in and I'll show you what I mean.	O
OK, so we've got our pathway.	O
Make a new layer.	O
Hi thing welcome more than one dog.	CHITCHAT
A whole herd.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you turn the camera there's like 5 dogs.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what's happening but they're having a good time.	CHITCHAT
Fish and if it was a fish I would have never left it up.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's try this so.	CHITCHAT
So I'm putting this layer on multiply so.	O
Here is what we get.	O
Basically, a shadow that goes over and it will darken the purple to a darker purple.	O
It'll darken the Brown to a darker Brown, so instead of me trying to figure that out, multiply is pretty nice here, so I might use a different brush.	O
But I think this might be the way to go.	O
Alright, so let's try it.	O
And we're going to do the same thing as we're doing right here.	O
With multiply.	O
We're going to do this with color Dodge to add highlights.	O
Yeah, and if you compare it with the other one, yeah, I'm more happy with it.	O
We are going to brighten things up.	O
But this is a good start.	O
And you can even use this on the green to add shadow 2.	O

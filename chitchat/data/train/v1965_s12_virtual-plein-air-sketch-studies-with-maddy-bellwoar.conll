So layer blending modes can be super Super Handy.	O
For this kind of thing.	O
And we can shift the color a little bit more towards blue or green if you want for continuing up onto the foliage and adding some shadows.	O
That color will make a little bit more sense there.	O
Yeah, I will merge that down.	O
And then make a new layer.	O
That does make me feel better, yes.	CHITCHAT
And let's try color Dodge, so make a new layer, put it on call Dodge.	O
I'll double click the layer and uncheck transparency shapes layer.	O
And then let's.	CHITCHAT
Pick a nice bright peachy color and look at that.	O
That's pretty cool, pretty cool effects.	O
It's a bit overexposed, but you can always lower the Opacity a little bit, but I think it works so well for this.	O
So then we're just gonna drop in some.	O
Some highlights.	O
And you can go right across.	O
The pathway you go across the pathway an across the dirt.	O
And apply the same color everywhere so it is intense.	O
Maybe right?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should turn that back on transparency shapes layer may be a little too intense.	O
With that on.	O
But so this is just a first pass at.	O
This will be able to go back in here and paint without the color.	O
Dodge just kind of paint normally after this, but I think this is working well to give us a starting point.	O
Alright, so we still have the layer the sketch on another layer.	O
Try not to merge that again.	O
OK, so now I will go back to a brush I was using at the beginning.	O
Just like a texture textured brush and let's add some blue ish so more blueish bounce light onto the road.	O
So these areas that are in shadow they're not super super dark and they are reflecting some really pretty blue light.	O
So now that we have a starting point I'm going to try to paint on top of this and clean up some things.	O
Get less muddy colors than what I have right now, hopefully that'll work.	O
But if anybody's painting along with me, I hope.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're enjoying it.	CHITCHAT
This one seems a little tricky, but it's I think are really pretty scene, so hopefully hopefully you'll enjoy that.	CHITCHAT
We can turn the painting into black and white to get a look at it and I would suggest turning the reference into black-and-white too, so this is really helpful to me.	O
It shows me that I mean look at these shadows and highlights so the shadows and highlights are more important than the difference between the road and the dirt.	O
Contrast Wise.	O
As much as I absolutely love dappled light, and I like painting scenes that involve it, I do find it a little tricky.	O
For the for exactly this kind of reason, the.	O
The values the.	O
The values in the colours and everything, they just it's so intense the difference.	O
Between these highlighted areas on the shadows.	O
But will get a nice glow.	O
We just gotta go back and forth until it makes sense.	O
I think just like with any painting.	O
If you feel like 1 area really feels wrong, sometimes that has to do not just with that area but with the rest of the painting.	O
Like there's a lot of I need to get a lot more darker values over in the.	O
The foliage and that will help make it makes sense why there's this dark area on the ground right now.	O
What I'm doing feels a little out of place because of that.	O
So let's let's just merge what we have now so far is like a beginning.	O
An will go to the Bush is on the side and add some more dark.	O

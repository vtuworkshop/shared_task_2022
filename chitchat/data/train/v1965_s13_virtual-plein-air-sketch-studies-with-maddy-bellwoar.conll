Dark colors and hopefully that will help us to visualize.	O
Overall, visualize the with the shadows should look like better.	O
So down here.	O
From this side and we can add in the trees too.	O
So I've tried to get too stuck on one area.	O
If you are like something that I have tried to remember as like, make sure the rest of the painting is working too.	O
'cause that might be part of why that one area is bugging you.	O
It might have to do with the relationship between that area and other things, so like it really will make more sense when we get these trees in.	O
Let's pick it dark Brown.	O
I love the gradient.	CHITCHAT
In the colour of these trees, so I'm doing them on during the trees on their own layer.	O
So this is going to be easier to do that way.	O
So paint the whole shape of the tree first, not worrying about anything to do with shading.	O
Just do one thing at a time.	O
So painting the shape of the tree.	O
Oops, let me choose a texture brush for my eraser will be better.	O
Alright, feeling in the whole shape and then it will lock the layer.	O
Press little checkerboard icon here.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Will get a nice purple blue at the top.	O
'cause look at the reference.	O
We've got a beautiful glow from the Sky.	O
Always enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
When I paint along a bit of suffering.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm definitely feeling that right now.	CHITCHAT
This one is tougher than I thought.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're going to put some bright lights hitting the tree also.	O
So along with that cool balance late, we also have bright splash of this dappled light hitting the tree.	O
Would be very scared to tackle reference like that.	O
Yeah, I definitely felt pretty intimidated when I finally got down to it.	O
I think I felt the scene was so pretty that I was not paying attention to anything else besides that this is beautiful.	O
Then we go to paint it.	O
How do we start?	CHITCHAT
But it's really good for practice with simplification.	O
Ha ha ha ha ha right.	CHITCHAT
That's such a funny summary of what I said, but it's also true.	CHITCHAT
Try reconsidering the whole painting is messed up.	O
So true, though, like sometimes, you're stuck on one area.	O
You're like.	CHITCHAT
Why is this not working?	CHITCHAT
Part of the reason it's not working is because of other areas.	O
It's like if we don't.	CHITCHAT
If we don't have anything that's casting the shadow yet, the shadow is going to look at wrong.	O
We need to get the trees in and you know all that other jazz and then then it's like.	O
OK now are shadows will make some sense hopefully.	O
Yeah, that's true.	CHITCHAT
Excellent quote.	CHITCHAT
So I'm putting some purple balance light on the side of the tree over here, just highlighting on the bark.	O
Hi Acer welcome.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
We are doing some virtual Pleinair Sketch Studies Painting Studies.	CHITCHAT
If you want to see the reference, they're all below the stream in the description.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's work on a another layer.	O
For the other tree, so new layer and.	O
Just fill this in back here.	O
Hi welcome, thank you.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have any questions just let me know.	CHITCHAT
So while following these reference we need to create our own ambience.	O
I mean images look dull, but the way you choose the color and lighting it all comes together well.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
It depends on what your goals are with your practice.	CHITCHAT
These kinds of studies you know you might have a specific goal, like maybe you want to work on getting the values like the shading to be accurate.	CHITCHAT
So then you would focus on that.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe you want to work on selecting accurate colors to the reference so you would do that.	O
So it depends on what you need to work on what you choose to study.	O
So for me.	CHITCHAT
I'm I used to those used to be my main focus, and since I was able to improve on those things overtime, then I've shifted my.	CHITCHAT
The goal of my studies to be something a little bit more like exploring my own style.	CHITCHAT
Things like you're talking about, so I will take the reference and try to.	CHITCHAT
Do a little bit more of my own thing with it.	CHITCHAT
You know when it comes to.	CHITCHAT
The mood and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
And so anyone I mean, of course, whatever you want to do is you're welcome to do.	CHITCHAT
But my point is, if you're just getting into doing these types of studies, don't feel like you have to come in here and really change things from the reference.	CHITCHAT
A law or go crazy like that.	CHITCHAT
You know it's fine to just just paint the reference for practice as it is, and then as you do more and more of these studies, I think you'll slowly get comfortable changing things from the reference and putting your own spin on it.	CHITCHAT

And some people might feel good doing that right off the bat, but for me when I started doing these I was like.	CHITCHAT
Very much just repainting the reference really accurately.	CHITCHAT
Are trying to.	CHITCHAT
It's a matter of opinion.	CHITCHAT
If it was accurate, but you know.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Claire see, I'm glad you're seeing progress was nice to hear.	CHITCHAT
Hi Mona, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Good morning.	CHITCHAT
Good morning.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so for this one I decided that it might be nice.	O
A nice contrast from the other reference we just did to take a little bit more of a tropical twist on this one, and it's leaning that way anyway.	O
There's palm tree in the scene, but you know we can.	O
Really put the colors more in that direction if you choose.	O
Which is fun.	CHITCHAT
Experiment with what makes that work.	O
So there's an area of this branch that's getting hit by lights will put a bright.	O
Pop of warm light back there.	O
Maybe I'll switch brushes to something that's better for doing little little branches and things.	O
We'll just get these in now while we're.	O
We're working in this area.	O
So a bunch of little branches.	O
Well at some leaves and stuff next, I like to paint branches first.	O
If I'm painting a tree where you actually see a lot of the branches, 'cause sometimes the trees really, really full and you see like a big blob of leaves.	O
In those case I'll just go right for painting the groups.	O
That leaves button it with a tree like this.	O
I like to paint the branches first.	O
And then paint that we use seems logical to me.	O
Let's see Hi Mattie, I heard about UI UX designers stopping by your streams including me.	CHITCHAT
Hi, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome, welcome well anyone is welcome to stop by.	CHITCHAT
I don't have a lot of personal experience in the that kind of design.	CHITCHAT
My boyfriend does.	CHITCHAT
But You're welcome to you after meeting painting questions.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Many artists just paint in what they see in a hyper realistic way.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Adele.	CHITCHAT
That's well.	CHITCHAT
That's some some artist like to paint that way always, and that's absolutely fine.	CHITCHAT
If it's you know people have different tastes, so for me I kind of started of- more like that and then overtime, my tastes have changed and now I have different personal preferences and I like to explore more stylistic approach, but that definitely changed overtime.	CHITCHAT
That wasn't always the case for me.	CHITCHAT
Hey sour puss.	CHITCHAT
This is so therapeutic thank you melody.	CHITCHAT
That's really nice to hear.	CHITCHAT
Was the hardest part in the process for me, probably.	CHITCHAT
The what they call the ugly stage.	CHITCHAT
Some paintings have it worse than others, but a lot of times when you're painting, you have to go through a period with your painting where it just looks awful like things aren't.	CHITCHAT
You haven't figured things out yet or you just started blocking things in and you haven't balanced the shading yet.	CHITCHAT
The values don't make sense, you know this just so common in most of the paintings that I do, there's going to be some phase where things just don't look good and you gotta just trust the process and power through that.	CHITCHAT
That phase of the painting and then be able to finish it up.	CHITCHAT
It's very, very normal, so I think that's the most difficult thing about painting is.	CHITCHAT
Sticking with it through that all.	CHITCHAT
Thank you sour puss.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like the the format I'm enjoying this too.	CHITCHAT
I had a lot of fun with it in the last stream, so that would be tried again.	CHITCHAT
All right, we've got another tree up here.	O
And it kind of disappears into the foliage.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Gotta walk my baby needs for an hour which is amazing.	CHITCHAT
Oh that sounds sweet sour puss.	CHITCHAT
That's really nice.	CHITCHAT
Getting out of the doors these days is a celebration.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it really is.	CHITCHAT
It's actually looking kinda nice outside.	CHITCHAT
Now is pretty gloomy yesterday and most of today, but now we're getting some sun.	CHITCHAT

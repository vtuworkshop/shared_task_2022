Little bit of sun peeking through the clouds.	CHITCHAT
Trying to figure out what to do with the palm tree here.	O
Yeah, I think I'm just going to sketch the Frans on the layer below.	O
What I'm working on right now.	O
I think that will be.	CHITCHAT
Easier.	CHITCHAT
And then will merge the layers.	O
So I'm going to try to keep this.	O
Loose.	O
So I'm not going to get 222 detailed with the palm tree.	O
Kind of trying to remind myself that right now I like painting palm trees so I can easily get sucked in.	CHITCHAT
Will add some little some little of these individual leaves.	O
Also, sometimes when painting organic things that can be fun to take a brush, a textured brush as your eraser, and erase back up into the shape that you created.	O
So having a cool shape of your eraser you can add details that way to buy, like subtracting from the shape.	O
That's so cute surplus.	CHITCHAT
This is four months old and has the cheeks of a hamster ready to hibernate.	CHITCHAT
Oh Sounds adorable.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we got a pretty good palm tree block in.	O
I'm going to lock the layer and do the same thing.	O
What we've been doing and pick a let's pick a bright blue.	O
And add a little bit of color to the.	O
To the tree so this.	O
Maybe we'll do it.	CHITCHAT
The opposite will go all blue and then add green.	O
So basically we're having a lot of their space between us in this palm tree and the Blue Sky Glow is sort of over like pouring over the palm tree and giving it this kind of glow effect in the in the photo.	O
It's like very intense and I like it, so I'm going to keep keep it.	O
Hi, very welcome.	CHITCHAT
Steven says it always amazes me watching a painter work in seeming to be apparently blobbing paint onto the canvas.	CHITCHAT
Then in the final five minutes a few strokes pulls off pull massive loves into a picture.	CHITCHAT
It's funny, it's funny too.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's really like a race at the end when I do these time studies.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I feel like it's not working for quite a long time and then just at the end.	CHITCHAT
It's like Alright Starting to get there.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I have that feeling.	CHITCHAT
I wish it was.	CHITCHAT
I wish I wish I could see it more clearly and earlier sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Gotta trust the blobs.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, I I.	CHITCHAT
I grew up in Florida so I'm very familiar with palm trees.	CHITCHAT
They always give me a good feeling, nostalgic kind of feeling.	CHITCHAT
Group in South Florida.	CHITCHAT
So we were always surrounded by Palm's.	CHITCHAT
One thing I don't like is that I ended up making these.	CHITCHAT
Up Frans kind of equidistant from each other.	CHITCHAT
I want them to feel more random, so I'm going to add a little bit of space.	CHITCHAT
In between.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha ha.	CHITCHAT
Alright will be will have to be satisfied with that.	O
For now the palm tree, but I might come back and work on it later.	O
So this was a sketch from earlier I was starting to try to fill in these darker areas.	O
Normally, like how that looks will raise out a bit of it and just go from there.	O
Right, but we are starting to make more sense here.	O
It is starting.	CHITCHAT
I have some see I have some brushes that have sort of a leafy texture which might come in handy here.	O
I was because I've been going for this traditional look.	O
I've been trying to paint everything and not rely a ton on stamp brushes with this particular style, but.	O
When it comes to leaves then I can make an exception.	O
I love using.	O
Leave brushes are kind of fun for you to stamp in.	O

I'm gonna try to work them into my painting in a way that feels natural.	O
So as the plants are getting further and further away from us, they're also getting a little bit more pale.	O
No, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hi Jennifer, welcome I hope you got a good rest.	CHITCHAT
So let's get a little bit more of a green green.	O
We've got a lot of Blue, Green, need some green green.	O
Can you recommend a good welcome tablet to work on?	CHITCHAT
So I'm using the Wakeham Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
If you are looking I love this tablet, but if you're looking for something in a little bit more of A.	CHITCHAT
Like depending on your budget.	CHITCHAT
In a lower price range, the Intuos tablets are really good.	CHITCHAT
Um, I'll type that name in the chat so the interest line.	CHITCHAT
I don't know about a specific one, 'cause I haven't really kept up with like what the latest models are, but I know a lot of professional artists that use those and they seem to last a long time and have good pressure sensitivity, so there are definitely an option.	CHITCHAT
But the welcome is come out.	CHITCHAT
The welcome brand has come out with a few different like more affordable screen tablets lately.	CHITCHAT
So if you really want to get a welcome, you could look at the welcome one or maybe the 16.	CHITCHAT
I think those are more reasonably priced screen tablets from them, but I really love my 22 so it kind of depends on your budget.	CHITCHAT
Hey pro designer welcome.	CHITCHAT
Now there's also other brands that make screen tablets.	CHITCHAT
If you'd really like a screen tablet and check out some other options.	CHITCHAT
So I'm not really like in love with the shape of these that I came up with over here.	CHITCHAT
Then I will rework that a little bit.	CHITCHAT
How long have you been painting for you make this look so easy.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Melody, I've been doing well.	CHITCHAT
I've been doing art my whole life.	CHITCHAT
Basically from when I was a kid.	CHITCHAT
I love to draw and I always would always draw.	CHITCHAT
But I got into digital painting about.	CHITCHAT
Like 6 to 7 years ago, maybe like 6 1/2 years ago somewhere around there.	CHITCHAT
So I've been doing digital for a long time.	CHITCHAT
Doing these virtual Plein Air Studies during these times studies is one of the things that's helped me out the most in getting really comfortable and experimenting with different styles and things.	CHITCHAT
So I started doing these maybe a year and a half to two years ago, and they've been like one of the most helpful things for me.	CHITCHAT
I think I improved more in that time than I did in the time before, so I would definitely recommend doing these kind of studies if you're interested.	CHITCHAT
All Ricardo I'm sorry to hear that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I haven't tried them out myself.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate the feedback for chat.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
I still have the palm tree on its own layer.	O
What's actually on the same layer is the other trees, but I'm going to remove it, but on its own layer.	O
The way I can kind of mess with the contrast and things.	O
So I'm going to take the lasso tool to help with some of these close-up leaves.	O
I actually love this technique.	CHITCHAT
So I'm excited to show you it's a simple idea, but basically just taking the lasso tool and sort of drawing with it so you select a leaf shape and then hold shift and then make another leaf shape.	O
And so they're pretty basic shapes.	O
Nothing too fancy.	O
And you could just select a bunch like this.	O
And fill that in with either solid color or something with texture if you want.	O
And then while it's still selected, you could give a little bit of a gradient or texture or something.	O

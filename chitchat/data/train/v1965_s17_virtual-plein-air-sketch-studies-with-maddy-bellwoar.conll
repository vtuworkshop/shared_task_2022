Make it more interesting, and then deselect it, and you've got a bunch of leaves and then make a new layer an.	O
I'll probably do a couple different layers of this is it's not necessarily you need things to overlap when you're doing this kind of stuff, you need to overlap for to look more natural.	O
So probably take me a couple layers to be satisfied, but.	O
Well, at another group believes.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Can you have a leave a link to your fabulous looking chair chairs manufacturer site?	CHITCHAT
Although I can guess it's expensive curiosity, I don't have a link handy, but let me type the chair model in the chat for you and I'm sure just Google it.	CHITCHAT
I think you'll be able to find it easily, but.	CHITCHAT
It is the Noble chairs epic gaming chair and black.	CHITCHAT
That's the that's The One I have.	CHITCHAT
I think you'll be able to find it.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So will fill in the new leave shapes.	O
You can add.	O
Some brighter colors, not variation.	O
You can decide which layer you want on top.	O
We can also take another brush.	O
And yeah, you're welcome at Keene.	CHITCHAT
It's a good chair.	CHITCHAT
I really like it.	CHITCHAT
And we can add a like a stem, you know.	O
We've got these floating leaves.	O
You can get it really get away with them floating anyway, 'cause sometimes the stems can be covered up by other leaves.	O
You don't necessarily see all this, but.	O
Yeah, I can draw that in.	O
Haha, this is an amazing portrait of a Tiger.	CHITCHAT
Hiding a Tiger would look so good in this picture.	CHITCHAT
It's good, good, good colors for a Tiger.	CHITCHAT
Alright, one more layer of leaves and I think we could.	O
Thank you, Pedro.	CHITCHAT
Q.	O
So if anything is bothering you about the other leaves, this might be time to use them to cover it up the additional ones.	O
Thanks fishing all.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Mona.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Well you guys are always welcome to join in if you like no pressure, but if you ever feeling inspired to, I always share the references that I use below the stream in the description and don't feel like you have to paint at this pace.	CHITCHAT
You know I've been kind of working my way up to painting faster over the last couple of years with doing time studies, but you're still welcome to join in if you want.	CHITCHAT
It's it's fun and we usually have a few people painting along.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Just for practice, I find it's a little bit more fun to practice with other people.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's hard to have the.	CHITCHAT
I don't know the motivation to start it up.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you ever want to paint along with the stream, you guys are always welcome to do that and you can just post whatever you do, whether it's a little sketch or a more detailed painting.	CHITCHAT
Whatever you have time for, you can post the results of that in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Uh, we're like I always have trouble depicting the difference between foliage and leaves at a distance from the close ones, like how to give the bouquet effect?	O
How should I deal with that?	CHITCHAT
Um, depicting the difference between foliage and leaves at a distance from the close ones.	O
OK, so there's a couple things you can do.	O
For one, you can make as they're getting further away.	O
Kind of like with what I did here.	O
Make them lighter in value, so so actually lighter, more like there's hazy air between those plants.	O
So for example, the further away plants what you can do is make them.	O
Like I said, lighter.	O
Sometimes you can have a more atmospheric color like add some blue.	O
They can be more towards blue.	O
The plants that are closer to you, they're going to be.	O
Darker, they're going to be more the real color less of this, like blue atmosphere that happens when things are further away.	O
And also you can paint them more detailed the further away plants you can leave them a bit blurry or loose and then the closer they get to you you want to.	O
Paint them.	CHITCHAT
Paint them more detailed I guess.	O
I hope that makes sense.	CHITCHAT

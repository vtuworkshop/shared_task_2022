Pamela Kyle's brushes are really good.	CHITCHAT
I've been on a kick of experimenting with making my own brushes, though.	CHITCHAT
I got into this like I don't know.	CHITCHAT
A few months ago and I'm kind of addicted to it.	CHITCHAT
So the brushes I'm using right now I've made an I'm working on putting together a brush set that will be available if anybody is interested in purchasing it.	CHITCHAT
I do have a brush set that's it already is available now that I've made that is a It's like a Ghibli inspired brush set.	CHITCHAT
It's got a lot of watercolor textures and.	CHITCHAT
Plants and foliage type things.	CHITCHAT
The brush that I'm working on right now is a little bit more dry.	CHITCHAT
Traditional textures like pastels, charcoals, maybe gouache with a lot of dry brushing, that kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, a little bit of both.	CHITCHAT
I've certainly used a lot of other peoples brushes, but at the moment I'm I'm interested in making mine, so I'm also I'm using a lot of custom ones right now.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
See I hope I'm not missing too much in the chat.	CHITCHAT
You guys.	CHITCHAT
Jennifer says.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to get you a picture of the ranch where I grew up so we can all work on it.	O
But if an effort but I'll get it, that would be really nice.	CHITCHAT
That would be really nice.	CHITCHAT
How are you switching from black-and-white so quickly?	O
Yes, it's a shortcut that you have to set up, but let me show you how to do it.	O
OK, so once you set it up one time you're going.	O
It's always going to be there, but you have to set it up one time, so you want to go to view.	O
Proof set up.	O
And then custom.	O
I'm just going to go slow in case anybody wants to write this down.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure you can also look it up later, but.	CHITCHAT
So view proof, setup custom and then you click that and then this box comes up and then the only thing that you need to change here is.	O
Under the device to simulate, you need to select working grade gain 20% from the drop down menu.	O
And then you can click OK.	O
So mines already done.	O
So I'm just going to cancel it.	O
But then after that anytime that you press CTRL Y it will turn your painting into black and white and you can just press CTRL Y 2.	O
To go back to to the colored version.	O
All thank you Pamela.	CHITCHAT
Let me get a link for you real quick.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for asking.	CHITCHAT
So again, this is a previous brush set that I made that you can look at in detail.	CHITCHAT
Make sure you like the textures and everything.	CHITCHAT
The ones that I'm using right now are in a brush that that will be coming out soon, so but I'll link you in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I thank you again for asking.	CHITCHAT
I saw another question.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to go back up here.	CHITCHAT
My painting is about 3 year old level Steven.	CHITCHAT
Love you see the painting you shared.	CHITCHAT
Alright, messing around with fresco cool.	CHITCHAT
I like the textures you can see the textures of the brush strokes and fresco.	CHITCHAT
Hey this is cool.	CHITCHAT
Hey don't please don't don't feel bad you gotta start somewhere an I mean I like what you're doing.	CHITCHAT
You got a nice bold hard edge and you've got some soft edges up here that those are.	CHITCHAT
Those are good signs to me.	CHITCHAT
I find a lot of times.	CHITCHAT
People struggle, especially at the beginning with landscape painting of including hard edges.	CHITCHAT
People really shy about hard edges.	CHITCHAT
I just keep just keep working on it.	CHITCHAT
You guys.	CHITCHAT
If you saw some of my early landscapes you might be very surprised because they didn't look like this, so that shouldn't surprise you.	CHITCHAT
But you know sometimes it can be.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, they were looking pretty rough when I started.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, Claire Z.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Uh, see, do you ever add texture to your paintings to look like an oil canvas?	CHITCHAT
Not usually Anthony.	CHITCHAT
Usually I just try to do that during the painting process with the brushes and with my painting style.	CHITCHAT
I don't usually overlea texture at the end I've seen people do it.	CHITCHAT
It can look cool, but it's just not my thing.	CHITCHAT
One thing I will do is sometimes give a little bit of noise filter, but that's about it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no problem Judy.	CHITCHAT
The best thing about that is Oh my gosh, check this out.	CHITCHAT
You can actually color pic when it's in black and white, so when it's in black-and-white you can color pic its color at picking the real actual colors and you can paint with the colors too.	O
And then when you turn it back into color, it's whatever color that you painted with.	O
So I use that a lot when I get confused and then I try to.	O
Like figure it out and then go back to color.	O
Yeah, exactly saying it's non destructive, it only is going to change your view and then you press CTRL Y and it goes right back to the colored version and it hasn't done anything permanent to your painting.	O
Hi Pablo's, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
So I use that a lot.	CHITCHAT
The other shortcut that I've set up for myself is the flip.	O

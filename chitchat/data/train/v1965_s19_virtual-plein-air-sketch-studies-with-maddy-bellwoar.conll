Which is a little less useful today.	O
I think the flip turn this over every time.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I like to flip the canvas because it gives me a fresh look at what I'm doing sometimes after I'm painting for awhile.	O
You know, you kind of get kind of like have a hard time even seeing any of your mistakes at that point.	O
So flipping the canvas it kind of helps.	O
Give you a fresh view.	O
Um followed one of your studies.	CHITCHAT
It took me days to get an awful result here.	CHITCHAT
Really fast indeed.	CHITCHAT
Need to practice a lot more.	CHITCHAT
And realize how good I am at photo shop and how bad at drawing.	CHITCHAT
It just takes time.	CHITCHAT
It takes time.	CHITCHAT
It will definitely benefit you that you're good with Photoshop though.	CHITCHAT
Like all that knowledge is going to be really handy in digital painting.	CHITCHAT
Show us your early landscapes.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'd be happy too.	CHITCHAT
I have actually gone through some of those on the streams before.	CHITCHAT
One day we can do that.	CHITCHAT
I wish the sad thing is that.	CHITCHAT
I lost one of my older hard drives.	CHITCHAT
Had even more of the like very very.	CHITCHAT
First one is in the sadly those have those have been like last time, but I do still have some some early ones that I can show in that some of you guys have seen but yeah.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to give a nice texture to these fluffy little little trees up here.	O
Little leaves and things.	O
So I'm going to try to explain something I hope.	CHITCHAT
I hope you guys will understand what I mean, but when it comes to painting faster and practicing with these kinds of studies, one thing that helped me was letting go of my expectations of how good any particular painting is going to look.	CHITCHAT
And just trying to get everything in the scene painted in in this set amount of time.	CHITCHAT
So let's say an hour or so is what I wanted to spend.	CHITCHAT
The amount of time I wanted to spend on a painting instead of like so for this scene.	CHITCHAT
For example, early on when I started doing that, I'm studies the thing that would be tough for me is I would end up with like one of the trees looking really good.	CHITCHAT
And then a lot of the rest of the painting just not even being there by the end like I would run out of time.	CHITCHAT
And then there would be like a whole area that I didn't paint.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
And so one of the things that I had to start doing was saying OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to paint everything in, even if it looks bad.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to paint it in so I would have like.	CHITCHAT
Very rough, just like almost like cartoon looking tree that I just put in so that had something in there and then I would go to start working on other things and get everything in the scene.	CHITCHAT
Just everything has to be in and then you can go back and improve different areas.	CHITCHAT
And So what happens is overtime as you do these studies, you get faster.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I would end up being better at budgeting my time slowly.	CHITCHAT
You're going to be able to do more, and you're going to be happy with what you can do in that amount of time, but it's really hard to get the full benefit of doing that.	CHITCHAT
I'm studies if you don't really treat them like a time study and you allow yourself to.	CHITCHAT
Like take along time on some area and then the other area isn't done.	CHITCHAT
So even if the results end up looking what you would consider as bad.	CHITCHAT
It's still a success if you're able to get everything in the scene, even if it looks rough.	CHITCHAT
Just get everything in that time and then just like let that be what it was you know.	CHITCHAT
That is a study and then you can like close it.	CHITCHAT
Never look at it again.	CHITCHAT
If you want, you know these don't have to be for your portfolio necessarily there just for practice and less you want to make them for your portfolio, but that changes things a little bit, 'cause then you start being a little bit careful.	CHITCHAT
Little bit too afraid of making mistakes.	CHITCHAT
So allow yourself some studies where it's OK if they don't come out great and there's no expectation of posting or sharing.	CHITCHAT
It would make a cool postcard, thanks.	CHITCHAT
Populous as I once painted a landscape painting, it came out so bad you wouldn't even know it was a landscape painting.	CHITCHAT
It's normal, it's normal.	CHITCHAT
I used to be more of a character painter when I first got into digital art, I did almost almost only characters.	CHITCHAT
And now I do.	CHITCHAT
Now I do primarily landscapes.	CHITCHAT
It's just my interests.	CHITCHAT
My interests kind of changed overtime.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, I'm just bringing it Up 'cause If you if you have the idea like I'm bad at this, I'm going to a landscape painter.	CHITCHAT
You can change that if you really want to get into it.	CHITCHAT
Don't feel like that you're doomed or something like even if you feel like you're not good at landscapes now.	CHITCHAT
That said, This is definitely something that can change overtime.	CHITCHAT
If you if you spend some time working on it just like anything I need to practice more on portraits and characters 'cause I haven't been doing that lately.	CHITCHAT

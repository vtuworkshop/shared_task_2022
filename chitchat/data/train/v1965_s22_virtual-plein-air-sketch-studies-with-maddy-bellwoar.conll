Different lots of different different tutorials and things that have helped me over the time that I've gotten into digital art and been doing that.	CHITCHAT
So there's a whole bunch of things there.	CHITCHAT
You know everyone has such different personal preference is it would be hard for me to recommend like one particular artist to you, but there's a lot of stuff there.	CHITCHAT
A lot of different different artists that do tutorial, so you can kind of like Peru's and see if anybody's.	CHITCHAT
Style appeals to you.	CHITCHAT
That's my biggest advice to people that are getting into digital art or any type of art.	CHITCHAT
And you're feeling kind of lost.	CHITCHAT
Ask yourself, like ideally, what kind of art would you want to be able to do?	CHITCHAT
Like?	CHITCHAT
What are your preferences?	CHITCHAT
And that means.	CHITCHAT
That could mean style or could mean stop subject matter and that can change overtime as you learn more like this.	CHITCHAT
Figure out what you want to do.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
I really hope you find something helpful there.	CHITCHAT
So for example, maybe you want to do portraits.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you want to do animal paintings, maybe you know whatever it is an you can find a search for artists that are good at that thing.	CHITCHAT
A lot of artists are selling tutorials nowadays Patris on gumroad, or doing free tutorials.	CHITCHAT
There's workshops, streams, so if you find what you'd like to be able to do then you can start looking for guidance on that thing.	CHITCHAT
If you don't really know what you want, it can feel really overwhelming.	CHITCHAT
And just remember that just because you were starting with something doesn't mean you have to only do that thing forever, so it doesn't have to be something that you overthink.	CHITCHAT
Just say, OK, I would like to be able to do portraits and just start following artists that do portraits.	CHITCHAT
Just looking for them.	CHITCHAT
On social media he ran be hands, watch some streams wherever whenever is convenient for you, and then you can find tutorials that way.	CHITCHAT
That's what I did, and that's there's so much out there.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Pavlos gave a really good recommendation in the chat.	CHITCHAT
That's a really good one.	CHITCHAT
Marco Bucci.	CHITCHAT
Man, I didn't list him in my top artists.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I guess I gotta cut it off somewhere.	CHITCHAT
But Marco Bucci is definitely been influenced with me with his colors.	CHITCHAT
I absolutely love what he does with color.	CHITCHAT
Haley are how are you welcome?	CHITCHAT
Almost missed you there in chat?	CHITCHAT
Well, I kind of.	CHITCHAT
I mean I want to do more with this, but I feel like I should kind of rap this one up or I'm going to run out of time to do the other paintings for today.	CHITCHAT
So I might I might like end this one here.	CHITCHAT
I'll add a little bit more highlights to the.	CHITCHAT
To the street here.	CHITCHAT
But I think then we'll go on to the next one.	CHITCHAT
I'm a photographer and always said painting gets lost at my elbow and won't come out my hand.	CHITCHAT
I love landscapes.	CHITCHAT
Well, photography is definitely art.	CHITCHAT
Maybe maybe you'd be interested in getting into as a like a starting point.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you'd be interested in like photo manipulation.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe you already do that as a photographer, but you know you can certainly paint over your photos.	CHITCHAT
Photo bashing is a thing, especially when they're your photos.	CHITCHAT
You have complete ownership over them.	CHITCHAT
You could maybe start with something like that.	CHITCHAT
That's fun to do.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Last little details.	O
I will go on to the next one.	O
If we have time I could always come back and do some more on this, but.	CHITCHAT
I will lock the layer so I don't accidentally somehow destroy this painting with some of the other ones that were doing.	O
But yeah, here's our first 2 first paintings.	O
Let's go on to the next one.	O
Hopefully will have time to do for in this stream.	CHITCHAT
That was my goal, although I had a little tech issues at the beginning.	CHITCHAT
We were kind of catching up from then, so we'll see.	CHITCHAT
We'll go for at least three, maybe 4, depending on how long things take, but the other two reference images that we have.	O
They're both below in the description, and I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Open these so one is quite a bit more simple than the other.	O
I'm a bit scared to be honest at this one that I picked, but somebody requested a painting a location in Singapore last week so I was looking around in there and on map crunch and you know it's kind of hard to find the perfect reference, but I found this scene which I thought was really, really pretty and just had beautiful, bright, cheerful colors.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of bounce light and interesting things.	O

I do think it's really detailed and technical because it's a building and there's a fence and all this kind of stuff so.	O
I think it might be a good challenge to try to simplify this.	O
Like I said, I'm a little scared, but let's try it.	CHITCHAT
Let's just try it.	CHITCHAT
We gotta push ourselves a little bit.	CHITCHAT
If you guys like the other image better, this was the other one which I think has cool lighting.	O
This was the other one that was potentially going to be for our studies today.	O
So you can do this one if you want.	CHITCHAT
If you find this one more interesting.	CHITCHAT
Already do photo manipulation.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for all your encouragement.	CHITCHAT
Cool cool, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Always go about 2 hours and realize they didn't save.	CHITCHAT
Yes, did I save?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I'm I usually click it with.	O
I usually click the shortcut CTRL S so I don't even remember.	O
Sometimes when I say it 'cause it's just happening.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you Claire Z.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Foster.	CHITCHAT
Thanks everybody.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
OK, so we've got the next image.	O
And we're going to try again to keep pretty.	O
To keep the our idea of getting the main.	O
Feeling of this scene and not obsessing over every detail because there are quite a few details.	O
So I think we can do it.	CHITCHAT
Let's put the reference a little bit larger on the other monitor, so I have this next to chat.	CHITCHAT
If you guys want to give it a shot, you can find the reference reference below the stream in the description.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to take a quick savati before we start this one.	CHITCHAT
Windows always get me Windows.	CHITCHAT
Windows always get me in paintings.	CHITCHAT
This one's got a lot of Windows.	CHITCHAT
Gotta face our fears.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we're going to do this composition.	O
I think this one is a better shape for this scene.	O
OK, so new layer I will do a sketch.	O
I will do a sketch.	CHITCHAT
I usually do sketches.	CHITCHAT
We can get rid of the other sketch.	O
So this will hopefully help us plan this out.	O
OK, so here we go.	CHITCHAT
If I want so if anybody feels overwhelmed by this, something that I can do to try to simplify things is think about the biggest shape possible and then work within that and make things smaller.	O
So, for example, this house on the left, it's kind of like this at the most basic level, and then within this we've got these different floors.	O
But we kind of got a shape like this and then down here there's another house next door.	O
Ooh Jackson, let me see.	CHITCHAT
So Jackson painted the last one with us.	CHITCHAT
You guys, anybody who painted along, please feel free to share if you if you feel comfortable.	CHITCHAT
Jackson this worked out really nice.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're happy with it.	CHITCHAT
I know you were feeling also overwhelmed by this reference.	CHITCHAT
I love this texture for the the branches and leaves up here.	CHITCHAT
This wispy texture that works perfectly for that type of plant.	O
It's really, really pretty.	CHITCHAT
I'm very happy with this.	CHITCHAT
I hope you are.	CHITCHAT
As beautiful as Purples.	O
Lots of different variation, Hue variation up here.	O
That was a tough one.	CHITCHAT
The pathway was really tough.	O
If I was going to come back and do anything, I probably work on my pathway a little bit more.	O
And then we've got the ground here in the foreground, just a little bit of that.	O
So within.	O
This shape we've got like the top floor here.	O
And then at the same time when we meet up with this other building next door.	O
Got the next floor and then we've got.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Like roof of the.	O
The ground floor.	O
This kind of thing, so I'm holding shift each time that I make us 'cause I'm trying to make straight line.	O
So I'm holding shift to do that is helpful.	O
So I think my proportions are a little off.	O
I'm going to move this up.	O
I think that second story.	O

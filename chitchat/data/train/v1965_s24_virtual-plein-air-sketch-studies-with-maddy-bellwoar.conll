The first story seems a lot.	O
I might just be because we're closest to it, but it seems a lot bigger.	O
All right and then we have a fence.	O
So I might I might try to freehand the fence.	O
I just felt like I couldn't really do that with the house very easily, so let's try here.	CHITCHAT
Something like this?	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Got a gate in the front?	O
And a big blocky thing.	O
Don't know what that is in between houses.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It supports the gates.	O
Big thing and then another gate here.	O
So maybe we can zoom in a little bit more.	O
Really focus on that one house and just have like a little glimpse of the neighbors.	O
I know I'm going to have some proportions issues, but I'm going to try to keep things roughly the way they should be.	O
So looking at the middle of this fence, this post comes up here and what is that line up with then?	O
There's this other post here.	O
These are the support like support beams.	O
And this is all one solid.	O
Yeah, structures I know, uh.	CHITCHAT
There's a.	CHITCHAT
There's a tree.	O
Luckily that comes over here and covers up a bunch of stuff.	O
Maybe we can make that re bigger.	O
Can make the tree but put an extra tree.	O
Um heilala I'm a graphic design student need to this platform and I really wanted to say that your work is amazing.	CHITCHAT
Thank you lol welcome, I hope you enjoy it here and thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
It's very nice of you and Hi Michael.	CHITCHAT
Hi Mike, from UK better late than ever.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for your brushes that I downloaded last week.	CHITCHAT
Really enjoying your tutorials thanks that makes me happy to hear an.	CHITCHAT
I hope you enjoy the brushes.	CHITCHAT
Satisfied with how it turned out, the lasso tool technique for hinting leave seems pretty useful to experimenting with it lately.	O
Lasso tool is so handy I go through phases of being obsessed with the lasso tool, and then I kind of.	O
Lately I haven't been using it too much 'cause I've been going for this painterly effect in the lasso tool.	O
Can be pretty precise.	O
But I like I do like it still for those leaves.	O
All right, so we've got step one.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to erase away guidelines I don't need anymore as we go.	O
'cause otherwise things are going to get really hard to understand.	O
So get rid of that diagonal line.	O
An I might make a new layer, so on another layer we're going to do the door and other things that might start to get.	O
Confusing.	CHITCHAT
So this.	CHITCHAT
Proportion is wrong.	O
That should be like this.	O
So there's a door back here.	O
Oops, I was doing that in another layer.	O
Try it again.	CHITCHAT
There's a door, and then there's a window.	O
Oh my gosh, there's so many windows and there's something else.	CHITCHAT
It's like a cabinet or something.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying not to zoom in, so.	O
That will help me from getting too obsessed with details.	O
Gotta window here with one 234.	O
Add suddenly the house is a deep forest.	O
Over here something else that's covered up by plants.	O
Thankfully all right up here.	CHITCHAT
We got more windows.	O
Hold shift for a straight line.	O
This sketch won't be in my final, this is just helping me place place things.	CHITCHAT
We will definitely be painting painting under this sketch and will get rid of it when we can, so I don't mind if things are a little messy as long as they are.	O
Help me put things in the right place.	O
So this window got 3.	O
And then we can duplicate that.	O
But we want room for one more.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Again.	O
Why am I doing that?	CHITCHAT
Oh 'cause I'm also selecting that layer.	O
OK, and then finally we got one window over here on the 2nd floor.	O
Oh my goodness.	CHITCHAT
But I do think that the light shining off the windows is really pretty and very satisfying in the bounce light.	O
That glow got a great lighting effect, so that is going to be the focus of this painting.	O

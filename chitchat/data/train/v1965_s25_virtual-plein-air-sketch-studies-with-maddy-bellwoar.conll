Another window with three probably again, copy that other one.	O
Same here.	O
Do do do.	O
And it's probably one more of the same.	O
Over here on the left, but it's partially covered by.	CHITCHAT
Archery archery friend.	CHITCHAT
This place looks nice.	CHITCHAT
I like it.	CHITCHAT
OK, the neighbors also have some windows, so they have some kind of like a balcony here and neighbors have one too.	O
It's like about this high.	O
I've got trees.	O
Not sure you sorry.	O
We have plants hanging.	O
Something like that.	O
OK, so just to assess before we get into things, I think between the second and third story I need to add some more room.	O
So I'm going to merge the windows down.	O
So we've got all this on the same layer, and then I'm going to select.	O
This layer and move it up because I think there's a lot more space there than what I indicated.	O
Ahahahahaha Jackson I know I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I.	CHITCHAT
What got into me with this one?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you guys can see the second story, we can actually see.	O
Underneath the roof.	O
Facing up towards it.	O
So here's this support beam and then back here.	O
Is the wall.	O
And that's all underneath.	O
Make an impressionistic version.	O
Yeah, my sketch is all on one layer.	O
It wasn't earlier, but I merged down at one point when I was like happy enough with it.	O
Usually if I'm going to overlap things, I will keep it on a separate layer and then once I do once I draw the whatever is going to be overlapping and then I think that it's OK.	O
Then I'll merge it.	O
Hey project, the paint things are going good.	CHITCHAT
I can give you a little preview.	O
This was the first painting of the day here and then we did like some tropical vibes over here and now we are.	O
Starting a pretty.	O
Technical one, but I'm going to try not to get too technical.	O
My actual painting.	O
I'm laying things out here 'cause I think it will help make it easier, but when we get into it, I'm going to try to focus on the lighting in the mood and maybe some textures.	O
Maybe some nice textures.	O
It will be very impressionistic.	O
Alright, so here's the end of this balcony.	O
OK well.	O
There's some other details in the foreground.	O
I'm getting lazy though.	CHITCHAT
I kinda just want to start painting.	CHITCHAT
So we might have my just like skip on through, but there's there's a like a plant pots that are attached to this.	O
Fence.	O
Will plants?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hi Jason, Good morning.	CHITCHAT
Haven't watched from your streams in awhile.	CHITCHAT
Glad to be here I'll go.	CHITCHAT
I'm good to see you again.	CHITCHAT
Yeah we did two studies so far these two up here and now we're we're beginning with another one so we came in a good time we're just starting this got through the sketch here and we're going to begin with painting in a moment.	CHITCHAT
So an example of something that I would keep on a separate layer having to do with the sketch is I would definitely make a new layer if I wanted to sketch in the tree on the left coming in front.	O
I would want to have that on a separate layer, 'cause I wouldn't want it to.	O
I don't know, it would just feel crazy to do it right on top of everything, but I don't even know if I'm going to sketch that in.	O
I think I'll just like wing that in the painting phase.	O
'cause it's a bit abstract of a shape.	O
Anyway, I know that it takes up this whole area, but we can see through it a little bit 'cause it's kind of loose.	O
There's a lot of space in between the leaves and branches.	O
I think it would be hard to sketch that in without taking a really long time.	O
So I'll just leave it out.	O

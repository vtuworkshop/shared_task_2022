Oh yeah, so the reference let me put it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Do.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Trying to organize the.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to look at the composition.	O
I want to give a little bit more room for the Sky up top.	O
I think it's important.	O
Nice blue blue Sky.	O
OK, well let's start painting.	O
I'm going to do a little clean up here and see what kind of random layers I have.	O
I don't know why I have two layers that I don't even know what's on them, so will get rid of those.	O
The other two are my other paintings will keep those.	O
And then we'll put this layer on, multiply lower the Opacity so it's easier to see through an will, put it around 20% or so, opacity, and then lock the layer.	O
Press the little lock icon here so we don't accidentally paint on that.	O
And make a new layer underneath and then I'll start painting there.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I think I will continue with the underpainting approach.	O
So I'm trying to model this after traditional painting Workflow.	O
I know that this might be really weird.	CHITCHAT
For some people, because it was really weird for me at first when I saw artists doing this, I saw a tutorial of someone doing this kind of thing and I was like what on Earth?	CHITCHAT
'cause I didn't do I started doing even though I did traditional drawing first I got into digital painting before traditional painting, so I wasn't familiar with the whole underpainting thing.	O
So this was really weird to me, but the idea is we're going to get rid of having a white or even Gray background.	O
We're going to have something that if we show through to this color at any point, it's just going to give a nice warm glow.	O
Yeah, thank you, we are.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm in CST.	CHITCHAT
I'm in the Netherlands, so for me it's actually what time is it.	CHITCHAT
330, three, 30.	CHITCHAT
In the afternoon it's crazy.	CHITCHAT
Oh thanks Lee.	CHITCHAT
OK yeah, you found them.	CHITCHAT
Yeah OK so yeah so so that it helps get rid of the white.	O
The Scary White canvas.	O
And also it's nice because well if you look at the value you know it's somewhere in the middle ish so when you paint lighter you're going to be able to paint lighter and you're going to be able to paint darker and it helps give like a way to sort of in a sculpture away like carve out your shapes rather than just having the shade everything down from from a light color.	O
I don't know that feels tough.	CHITCHAT
Feels tough.	CHITCHAT
Hi there, Liesl.	CHITCHAT
I hope I'm saying Your name right.	CHITCHAT
You guys can correct me if I mess up your names.	CHITCHAT
Just found it yesterday.	CHITCHAT
Love how you see color and light.	CHITCHAT
Do you do any of your gouache paintings on live streams?	CHITCHAT
All thank you.	CHITCHAT
I do.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I'll be doing that tomorrow on Twitch so I can put a link to that in the in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I'll be doing some traditional.	CHITCHAT
Painting.	CHITCHAT
Every.	CHITCHAT
Every.	CHITCHAT
Thursday and thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the nice comments.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now we've got our underpainting an I will just make a new layer on top of that and then start my painting.	O
So now I'm going to go with color for the Sky.	O
Anne will pick something really.	CHITCHAT
I want to go like really just as intense as the reference.	O
'cause That's really blue.	O
Yeah, that's nice.	CHITCHAT
So do you see when I, when I don't perfectly cover that area you see through with this like dusty kind of texture?	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it, so that's a nice thing about doing this kind of underpainting and we can also choose.	O
So I'm going to color pic from the blue will go a little bit later.	O
Anna little bit towards the green and will get just a tiny bit of a different Hue.	O
And then we can go over top to give a little bit of a gradient.	O
Just a little bit.	O
So then we have a soft transition between the you know 'cause the Sky is always going to be deeper blue right up top and then towards the horizon it gets brighter and brighter and a little bit more washed out color so.	O
Forget that a little bit.	O
So next thing I like to work big to small, so we want to get rid of the Orange.	O
I mean we don't mind a little showing through, but we want to get everything blocked in so.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Let's figure out what color goes is going on down here on the ground.	O
So there's a big range there's.	O

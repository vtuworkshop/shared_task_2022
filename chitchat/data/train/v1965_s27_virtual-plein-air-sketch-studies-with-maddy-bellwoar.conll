There's the area and Shadow and highlight and I'm trying not to color pic from the reference so it takes me awhile sometimes.	O
To guess what color is there, but I feel like a color similar to this is good for the darker areas, so I might use that as a starting point, and then we're going to add the bright white highlights.	O
Oh cool, you're starting Nathan Foxes Landscape quote schools.	CHITCHAT
Of course you are going to love it.	CHITCHAT
It is amazing.	CHITCHAT
It is like the best course that I've taken of that kind.	CHITCHAT
And honestly is one of the most helpful courses I've ever taken related to art.	CHITCHAT
It goes over so many fundamental things.	CHITCHAT
It's really, really good.	CHITCHAT
And he actually does a couple digital demos in that, even though it's like a watercolor and gouache thing, he does a couple digital demos, which was like a really cool surprise for me as a digital artist.	CHITCHAT
That was like wow.	CHITCHAT
This is awesome, so don't be nervous.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be great.	CHITCHAT
All thanks, you guys use colored gesso, that's awesome.	O
That makes sense, yeah.	CHITCHAT
So my experience so far.	CHITCHAT
I do mostly like I do mostly guassian traditional so I don't have a lot of experience with gesso and things like oil and acrylic, so that's cool to hear about.	O
So I'm trying to find a nice sort of shadow color for the building.	O
Just as a starting point, I'd certainly want to get a lot brighter than this.	O
But I really like the glow that's happening inside under the.	O
For example, under their roof.	O
Where there's like a little bit of a glow, and then you get the bright.	O
Bright sun so hey, maybe I'll have to go back and forth to get the right colour.	O
Maybe it will take a little time.	O
OK, so I think for me this is actually enough that I'd like to start with the bright white areas and this painting.	O
I feel like I'm going to use some selection tools to make sure things are pretty crisp.	O
Even though I want a painterly look, I want those textures to exist within strong shapes that are going to make this easy to look at and understand what's going on.	O
So I'm going to use the rectangle marquee tool to just select direct angle.	O
And then we're going to pick a color that's really bright, almost pure white, but not quite there.	O
What will figure out what's a good color for this area, but?	CHITCHAT
And here we go.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to fill in this area around the windows where the really, really bright sun is shining on this house.	O
Anne, I want the.	O
The light to end kind of around the same area.	O
what I could do is use a another brush and just erase out a straight line across everything that would also do it.	O
Using gold gesso underwater color gives a bit of a glow.	O
That sounds really pretty gold gesso.	O
I didn't even know that existed.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, cool thing with using texture brushes like this on buildings is that it can give you that look like stucco or something.	O
I mean, this building is honestly pretty smooth looking but yeah, it's an interpretation.	O
So maybe I'll select a similar brush for the eraser so it can erase down into it, or very straight across.	O
Depends on how bowl do you want to be with that?	O
But looking at the reference, I think actually I should probably go a little higher.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
There we go, that's better, Yeah, Alright, let's go down to the next floor.	O
I think this will make a lot more sense after we have the bright white in.	O
Next thing would probably be windows for me.	O
I'm doing this all on a separate layer too, so we might be able to easily edit things once I feel like I'm happy with where everything is, I'll merge it down.	O
Got a little bit left to do before I feel confident about that.	O
So holding shift go across for straight line.	O
Hold shift.	O
We don't need any bright areas in the middle here.	O

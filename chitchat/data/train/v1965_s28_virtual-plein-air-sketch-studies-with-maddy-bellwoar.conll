That's going to be.	O
Shadow One thing that I've learned is if you want your highlights to really, really stand out, there's only.	O
You can only go so bright you know there's only you can only go to a maximum of pure white, so.	O
What we could do is go to the background and go to like curves or brightness contrast and like kind of dark and things.	O
Lube it more in everything else.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I like what that does to the Sky that makes the Sky really intense.	O
I might have to just work on darkening the building.	O
I'm OK with how things are, but that's just a tip.	O
Sometimes.	O
If you're having trouble making the glowy areas look as Glowy as you want, or as bright as you want, you can consider darkening the other areas around it.	O
Like relative.	O
To that, and usually that helps make that area really pop.	O
But I think I'm OK with how it is.	O
what I might do is go a little bit more towards pier way in a couple areas.	O
The nice thing about doing a sketch for this one is now it's like pretty relaxing overall to.	CHITCHAT
Do like fill in the shapes.	CHITCHAT
You wouldn't think of painting buildings is being relaxing.	CHITCHAT
Putting the time in for the sketch makes this a bit more.	CHITCHAT
Relaxing.	CHITCHAT
See, these aren't lined up properly to the reference book.	O
Hopefully it'll work.	O
We've got a another highlight across the bottom here.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
We've got some dappled light on the.	O
On this fence, so will have to come back and add more shadows, but I'll go pretty brave with it for now.	O
Just to block in the shape.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
What am I missing?	CHITCHAT
We've got other areas that are going to be bright, but I think these are the brightest.	O
So I'm going to lock the layer that already do that, no lock the layer.	O
Of course we're going to lock the layer there and then we can go brighter and then.	O
Go even even more Bray just in a couple spots like right right where the brightest light is hitting were almost looks overexposed in the photo we can go a little bit brighter there.	O
And that's it.	O
That's the phrase I think I will go.	CHITCHAT
Saying, says Daniel Smith, paint is made in Seattle.	CHITCHAT
They have a pretty goal.	CHITCHAT
Gesso and wonderful granulating watercolors.	CHITCHAT
I've heard good things about Daniel Smith.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know it was made in Seattle.	CHITCHAT
That's so cool.	CHITCHAT
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
My sister lives well nearish to there.	CHITCHAT
Awesome.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to make a new layer under this layer.	O
I think it might be easier to paint the windows.	O
Having that having the white layer separate, so we'll see I won't merge it quite yet.	O
I usually like to merge pretty often with these studies, but.	O
OK, I think the next thing is that I want to work on are probably the rooftops and then it'll be hopefully easier to understand what's going on with these buildings.	O
So up here, maybe I'll start with a.	O
This warm, almost like Terra cotta ish color and then we can go a little bit brighter for some highlights.	O
We can lock that layer.	O
And just kind of do a little bit of a stripe like this is kind of a fun thing about doing.	O
The stylized work is you can sometimes hint at things in a way that isn't necessarily realistic, but it gets the job done.	O
It's kind of fun, so using patterns and stuff.	CHITCHAT
A little shadow over here.	O
That's pretty bright.	O
Don't know if I like that.	CHITCHAT
Better.	O
Maybe a little shadow Ray on the Ridge here so it's.	O
We can get a feeling of that edge.	O
I like to do these little dots for a tile roof.	O
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, Robert.	CHITCHAT
That's very nice of you.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like my my gosh work.	CHITCHAT
I think I've heard that comparison before.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I love bright colors.	CHITCHAT
You guys I can't help that.	CHITCHAT
That's one of the things that I love about gouaches for someone who likes bright colors and how bright you can get things in digital gouaches great 'cause you can also get really bright.	O
OK, so this the roof here is a little bit darker.	O

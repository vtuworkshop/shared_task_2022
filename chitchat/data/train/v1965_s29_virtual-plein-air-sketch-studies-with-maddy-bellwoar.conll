I think it's partially to do with the angle and maybe that tree.	O
Or maybe it's actually just a different color?	O
Is a different house.	O
So some highlights here to show the reflection.	O
This roof is definitely made out of some kind of different, but it looks like a different.	O
Texture to me.	O
It looks very reflective.	O
We may come back to that.	O
I'm not crazy about that, but well, at least get some of the reflection in.	O
Here.	O
We're going to get some shadows, so if you're having trouble picking colors for shadows and highlights in your work, here is something that I like to do is, for example this.	O
I would consider be like real color or the local color of that.	O
Roof is just a guess 'cause we're seeing it at an interesting angle with a lot of shadows and highlights, but this is what I'm guessing is close to the color that that roof actually is.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
If you drag, if you color pic from there then you can go to your color wheel, go towards a darker color.	O
Just drag that colored down and maybe will go a little bit more towards purple to have like a cooler Shadow and then you can access from there.	O
If that's a good color for your shadow.	O
If you want it to be darker or something like that.	O
What is the name of your color wheel software?	O
It is called Coulouris.	O
If you look below the stream in the description, there is a link Anna Discount Code for it.	CHITCHAT
If you're interested.	CHITCHAT
It is a a plugin that is like a third party plugin.	O
So if you have photo shop CC 2019 or any more recent 2019 or 2020 then you will have a similar color wheel just already included.	O
That's a somewhat recent update, so if you go to window.	O
Color.	O
Then you can find it there.	O
It might show up like this.	O
The Hue Cube 'cause this I think was the default, so you can just go up here and select a color wheel.	O
So this is similar and this is already included, but the cooler is has some extra features.	O
It has gamut masks and things that can help you with different color schemes like you know hooking you up with secondary colors and different things like that.	O
I honestly don't use that stuff too much, but for some people might be really nice to have depends.	CHITCHAT
But I just like the triangle.	O
I really like the picking the colors from the triangle personally.	O
I find it easier for some reason.	O
Some people really prefer the qubits.	O
Apparently it's a personal thing.	O
But yeah, I like the triangle format.	O
Yeah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Millie.	CHITCHAT
Yeah you can find it below.	CHITCHAT
So we'll put a.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, the underpainting color seems like a pretty good color for the area below the window.	O
Tired out the window.	O
The overhang of the roof on the 2nd floor.	O
That color seems like it's working pretty well.	O
Let's do windows.	O
Let's do windows.	CHITCHAT
I do feel like I'm a little all over the place, but I'm just trying to look at what areas have big shapes that need to be filled in so the White was really standing out to me as being like really important.	O
And then the roofs were really big.	O
And now I just think, OK, Windows should be next so I don't know.	O
I try to explain my thought process, why I'm doing what, what, in what order, and sometimes I'm not even sure.	O
But yeah, we're trying to get the big to small get through these important.	O
Aspects so for the windows we could do something like this an make a selection with the.	O
Rectangular marquee tool.	O
So we make make one rectangle and then hold shift and you can make another rectangle and then hold shift and you can do something like that.	O
And let's see what it looks like.	O
Let's see if it ends up looking to mechanical or if we like it.	O
So how to choose the right color?	O
So we can drop in a color for the window.	O
And then let's put in a highlight.	O
So wherever the white is stopping, that's where we're going to that whole area.	O
Below there, we want to have a lighter color.	O
So we want to highlight to match up.	O
You know, 'cause The Sun's hitting the windows and the wall.	O
Hey, that could be a fairly fast way to do that.	O

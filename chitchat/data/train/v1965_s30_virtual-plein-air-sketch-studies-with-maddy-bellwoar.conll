I do think that I'm too bright with the window.	O
Let's Dark in that little bit.	O
We are, it says, a little artist trading cards size.	CHITCHAT
Quick sketch.	CHITCHAT
Wait, you did a quick sketch of this one that is OK.	CHITCHAT
Is the one before we are.	CHITCHAT
I was like how?	CHITCHAT
This is so pretty.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
It has a great enerji yeah really nice enerji impressionist.	CHITCHAT
That kind of feeling.	CHITCHAT
Is this pastel again?	CHITCHAT
I love that texture.	CHITCHAT
I gotta work on a texture I gotta work on a brush that looks like that.	CHITCHAT
Lee art.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to make a brush based off of your painting.	CHITCHAT
Your pastel painting style.	CHITCHAT
With Clarice, can you have the Hue Cuban RGB sliders at the same time?	CHITCHAT
Oh I have no idea.	CHITCHAT
I've actually never tried to do that.	CHITCHAT
I actually don't even know if you can have the cube in Coulouris.	O
I've never tried to use the cube before here.	O
I don't know if they have one.	O
Yeah, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you have the cube.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you have the cube.	CHITCHAT
Do you?	CHITCHAT
Do you use the cube?	O
Instead of the.	O
The Triangle.	O
Never looked for it before, but I don't see it.	O
I didn't see it in the settings.	O
All right, so we've got windows.	O
I mean, I could just duplicate this window.	O
Can shift it a little bit more towards blue.	O
So I'm trying not to color pic from the reference, but sometimes it gets to the point where I might breakdown and do it soft pastels.	O
So pretty so pretty.	CHITCHAT
I was going for that kind of thing with this brush actually, but.	O
I got more work to do.	O
What are you using Strama computer?	CHITCHAT
I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
It's a screen tablet.	CHITCHAT
I'll type the model in the chat.	CHITCHAT
So you can look it up if you like.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I will continue with the windows in this manner, 'cause I feel like it's working pretty well.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I might just duplicate once and then.	O
These windows have a little bit of a different lighting to them.	O
There's more sons will do these.	O
Separately, will do with their own.	O
Their own painting.	O
Alright, so I'm selecting everything we can select this one too.	O
And this can be a starting point.	O
I'll color pic from what I have over here on that window and then these are just going to get a little brighter.	O
So this one is basically the same, but then we get.	O
Bees get super bright lot of light hitting.	O
You're a Hue Cube fan.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know this about you.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kidding.	CHITCHAT
I wish I was, you know, it was a problem for me for awhile till I found something and now it's The Standard and well, not standard, but it's an option in Photoshop so.	O
No problem, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't think it has the Hue Q.	O
Oh Ryan Oh my goodness, how are you still awake?	CHITCHAT
I'm wondering if we should make a set up section.	CHITCHAT
Actually, now that you mention that that would be amazing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we are having a lot of, you know similar questions which I don't mind.	CHITCHAT
You guys are totally fine to ask that.	CHITCHAT
'cause like somebody you might not be here when somebody asks it earlier like don't feel bad if you want to know something, just ask me.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, yeah and it may be that would be good.	CHITCHAT
To be able to put a section for like.	CHITCHAT
Tech details and stuff.	CHITCHAT
OK so yeah we got top floor windows.	O
So one thing I might want to do is.	O
Come in between these windows and bring that color little bit of.	O
That White glow.	O
The wall paint color.	O
And if I turn off the sketch, if I can find that layer.	O
Yeah, then well, we see that a lot of areas are not blocked in yet, but you can see how the.	O
How the windows look?	O
Put that back on.	O

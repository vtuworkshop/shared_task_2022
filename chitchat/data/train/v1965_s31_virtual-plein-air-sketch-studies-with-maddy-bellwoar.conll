Michael says there is an Adobe extension in Photoshop 2020 called Adobe color themes, which is worth a look.	O
Cool, thanks.	CHITCHAT
The non triangle.	O
Oh, thank you as well.	CHITCHAT
OK so yeah we go on.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Oh, hang in there.	CHITCHAT
I hope I hope you're almost done.	CHITCHAT
I'll put a little bit of a shadow under the.	O
Under the roof, turning on, turning that layer on a Nov or that really made me realize I need to work on this area.	O
Oh yeah, yeah Ryan.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely no.	CHITCHAT
I totally know what you meant.	CHITCHAT
Totally know even I just didn't want to discourage anyone.	CHITCHAT
Alright, the same will add A.	O
Highlight a little bit of a cooler color.	O
I absolutely love this in the reference.	CHITCHAT
If you guys can pick up on it underneath the so the 2nd floor underneath the roof.	O
There's there's some bounce light and.	O
It's just, it's really, really pretty.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what color it is.	O
Honestly, let's call it pick and find out what color is.	O
It's that color.	O
What do you call that?	CHITCHAT
If this color.	CHITCHAT
But it looks really cool compared to everything else like wow.	O
Mine is like way too bright.	O
That's OK, I'm going to keep going 'cause I've been working a relative to the other colors in my painting, so I want to change it now, but.	O
Yeah, I really like that highlight.	CHITCHAT
Oh that's awesome Ryan great.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad to hear it.	CHITCHAT
Get a little bit more of a shadow under the top here.	O
OK.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Who merged that down?	CHITCHAT
Gotta start merging things.	O
I don't like it when there's too many layers.	O
Will merge the windows.	O
And merge this too.	O
OK so we have.	O
Basically everything on the same layer right now.	O
And we're going to add more windows.	O
So let's do the same thing we did before will make a selection.	O
For the windows and I wouldn't look into a bunch at once.	O
So here do do do.	O
And here.	O
I'm trying to leave a little space in between the windows.	O
For the wall.	O
I call that color.	O
Desaturated cappuccino brilliance.	O
I'm like I'm not even going to try.	CHITCHAT
I like that.	CHITCHAT
I could go for a cappuccino right now.	O
All right, and one more over here.	O
Maybe we'll just select all these.	O
Shall we do it all?	CHITCHAT
Will just get all these will do assembly line windows.	O
So I'm holding shift to add to this election every time and you can hold alt to subtract from it if you select too much.	O
You can also control Z.	O
You can undo a selection, so.	O
Super handy.	O
Down here we've also got windows.	O
Let's just get 'em all.	O
So for example, down here, if I select with the rectangle tool, then I end up overlapping some other things, so I can hold alt and.	O
Deselect areas.	O
And let's go back here.	O
Dude.	CHITCHAT
Do.	O
OK, we got a whole bunch of window selected, so let's see what we can do with them.	O
So one thing you can do if you feel safer painting like this is you could just drop in a flat color on all of 'em.	O
So and then you could paint on top of that because you'll have you'll be able to do a lock transparency could press that button and then little checkerboard button on the top of your layers palette.	O

Then anything you do will only affect those shapes.	O
So if you feel like it's too, it doesn't feel comfortable having this big selection.	O
I don't mind having this election for a long time, it doesn't really bother me too much, but.	CHITCHAT
If you want to, you can feel something in there, but for me we're just going to go like this.	CHITCHAT
Through the windows.	O
So the next one down here, this one is pretty dark, so we'll start with our shadow color and maybe go even darker, maybe a little bit blue.	O
So those windows are pretty dark and had a couple little highlights.	O
Things look shiny.	O
Down here so we have a shadow from the.	O
Yeah the the overhang of the roof here.	O
Love the right windows on the top floor looks like cloud reflection.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I could see that.	CHITCHAT
I wonder what really is I, I'm sure.	CHITCHAT
Well, the sun is really bright, so that's part of it.	CHITCHAT
But you're right, it looks like clouds.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I didn't even think about that.	CHITCHAT
So we'll make these pretty bright too.	O
We can go a little bit more from a blue green blue to a blue blue.	O
And then the bottom.	O
We've got pretty dark windows.	O
Clever is so funny.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's been a lot of instances of excluded windows from my paintings, seriously?	CHITCHAT
There's been a lot of times where I just especially getting speed studies where I'm like we don't have time for Windows well.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, specially windows and reflected things.	CHITCHAT
But here I'm trying to make up for it all in one painting, trying to get all the windows in this one.	CHITCHAT
I want to put some random little shines in here.	O
Little tiny reflections and things.	O
And these windows are pretty dark over here.	O
OK.	O
Are we bear?	CHITCHAT
A little extra.	O
Contrast.	O
OK, we deselect and this is what we have man.	O
Those windows on the bottom they just seem like super out of place.	O
It's just because they're so dark and everything else around them.	O
It doesn't quite fit in yet so we'll get there.	O
Will get there.	O
We just gotta work on the other things around those windows and it will start to make more sense.	O
But yeah.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Are we still need the we still need the sketch layer, but I'm looking forward to not needing it anymore.	O
Let's work on making that happen, so I want to fill in everything that.	O
Right now we're relying on the sketch for.	O
So one thing would be the.	O
Looks like a metallic kind of affect on the edge of the roof.	O
So we'll make a new layer, paint that in.	O
We can lock the layer and then if we wanted to look metallic or shiny then we need contrast so it looks like there's some little like ripples in it.	O
Hello mother ship welcome thank you thank you.	CHITCHAT
Can't be faulted, their windows were meant to look past am clever.	CHITCHAT
I see where you get your name.	CHITCHAT
That's going to be excused from now on.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
A little bit of highlights to make this look shiny.	O
Does it read?	CHITCHAT
OK from afar.	O
Hopefully we can always paint over it.	O
I'll try not to get too upset, obsessed?	CHITCHAT
OK, let's go to the second floor and do the same thing.	O
Just hold shift.	O
For straight line.	O
I think there's a little bit of reflection of light from the trees, so we get a little bit of green on this.	O
Just a tiny bit.	O
It's nice that we have a straight on view and I can just hold shift to make a straight line.	O
If it was, if we had a different angle.	O
Then I wouldn't be there.	O
Wouldn't be so convenient.	O
So adding some highlights.	O
To the roof.	O

The.	CHITCHAT
The refund Papa the first first floor hoops.	CHITCHAT
Tried to make a straight line and that's what happened.	O
That out.	O
OK.	O
Michaelsayscolor.adobe.com great place to play and find colors which can then be saved straight to your library.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the suggestion.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So the next thing I want to do is where the roof on the top I want to pick a darker, almost Brown.	O
Color.	O
We are getting a bit of a hard shadow right under the tiles and it's pretty intense.	O
The contrast I'm going to do this on a separate layer 'cause I'm still unsure about the colour I'm I'm choosing to go a little less saturated.	O
Do you want to see something cool?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, definitely.	CHITCHAT
And will try.	CHITCHAT
Doing that same thing here.	O
Maybe if I apply the shadow to more than one?	O
Floor it will start to.	O
Start to work.	O
Gotta get that highlight on this one too.	O
This house is.	CHITCHAT
Really pretty.	CHITCHAT
I want to I want to get this.	O
Top of the second roof.	O
The roof on the second floor.	O
A little bit more the right colors right now.	O
Whoops, we just have the blue Sky.	O
Showing, but we want this.	O
Peachy color instead.	O
Try to rotate the view and raw with the shift key down.	O
Try to rotate OK.	O
Actually, what is the shortcut for rotate?	O
I literally never do it.	O
Let's have to do it this way.	O
Oh wait, that's The Transform.	O
Whew.	CHITCHAT
Every once in awhile I rotate by accident, but I actually don't know how to do it on purpose.	O
Can somebody tell me how?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like we were talking about earlier today, but I only ever flipped my canvas for some reason.	O
Well, there's a little bit of back story as to why, but I never rotate it and I don't even know how to do that.	O
But I'm curious what happens.	CHITCHAT
It's just R.	O
Oh yeah, I should've known that I OK yeah it's are OK so we've rotated.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to hold the shift.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
So it's still.	CHITCHAT
It's still horizontal, but because I've rotated that can make the line in that direction just R.	O
Thanks, Ryan.	CHITCHAT
Thanks you guys.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's a reason for me to actually rotate my canvas.	O
So we were talking about earlier like why do I not rotate and the basically the story is I used to do some.	O
Process videos and things and I notice that when I would record and try to speed up the process of me painting with.	O

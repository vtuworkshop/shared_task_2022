When when I would rotate the canvas it would make it really not nice to watch the video sped up 'cause it would be like very jarring with everything.	O
Tilting around all the time, so for process videos I kind of got out of the habit of.	O
Using that function and then I just started relying on flipping the canvas, which also can be a little bit annoying if you speed the video up a lot.	O
But yeah, I got used to just only flipping every so often and then I never use rotate anymore.	O
Didn't even know what the command was.	O
Anyways, the shift draws actually constraint to the views horizontal vertical, so you can draw straight lines at any angle by rotating the view.	O
That's cool, thank you, thank you for that trick.	CHITCHAT
I might use it in the future, 'cause that comes up sometimes.	CHITCHAT
You can also do the make A dot and then making a hold shift to make another dot and it'll make a line between the dots, but you see what happens here.	O
So for example dot, you can barely see my DOT but thought shift dot.	O
Oh, because the weight here we make it on the layer above, so dot shift dot but it will apply the like pressure sensitivity of your brush, so you'd have to turn of- transfer an shape dynamics to make that work you know.	O
Yeah, so then then then you get that straight line, but it won't.	O
It won't be.	CHITCHAT
You won't be able to like use the.	O
Control things as much.	O
Nice.	CHITCHAT
OK, well I'm glad it helped.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you David.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's.	CHITCHAT
Get back to our house.	O
I think I'll merge down what we've done so far.	O
Will keep going what?	CHITCHAT
What else do we need to put in?	O
To the sketch so that we can get rid of the sketch.	O
So I want a new layer and I'm just going to work on some things.	O
Oops, let's let's get my transfer back on my brush.	O
Yeah, I don't like to work without that.	O
Just make sure that the lighting is making sense.	O
Like where does this white glow end should be the same on both of these columns?	O
Thanks, I'm hoping that will help me about a tablet years ago, but almost never use it because it was always wanting to turn it and it doesn't work like that all there you go.	CHITCHAT
OK are are an you can turn everything.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, David.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's figure out I don't really know what happened over here, but for some reason this roof is like really far away from the other house with.	O
That's not how it should be.	O
Let's get these guys a little closer.	O
Leart says I'm actually used to not rotating the canvas due to doing traditional art, so you don't rotate.	O
So for me I never rotate my paintings when I'm doing gouache painting for example, 'cause usually it's taped down to a board or to my desk.	O
But if I'm sketching with pencil or pen, I do find that I will like rotate the paper if it's like the papers loose if it's not taped down then I will.	O
I will turn it.	O
It kind of depends on the medium.	O
So I want to go a little bit more towards green and a little bit darker for this.	O
Shadow under here.	O
It's maybe a little bit about Yankee color on its own, but I think in the scene it's kind of nice.	O
And it's a result of bounce light.	O
There's a bunch of plants and things I think those might be affecting it.	O
Light bounces off the plants.	O
So I'm looking at the time I do think we're going to end up just finishing this painting for the day.	O
I don't know if, well, I think we won't have time to do a fourth.	CHITCHAT
'cause this one is turning out to be a bit time consuming and we had some tech issues earlier.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I think we'll just finish up this one and that will be my goal for this stream today.	CHITCHAT

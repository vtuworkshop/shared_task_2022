Just for you guys that were.	CHITCHAT
Following along with the paintings.	CHITCHAT
And these windows also should be a little bit lower.	O
I think I made them a little bit too high.	O
There's a bit of space under there between.	O
So little shadow under that like overhang.	O
Bring that will further over to this side comes.	O
Out over top of.	O
That other post.	CHITCHAT
Very cool.	CHITCHAT
Thank you yeah I am project I've been using actually one brush from most of this painting.	CHITCHAT
I think I did the underpainting with a different brush and other than that I've been using one brush.	O
I'm really happy like it.	CHITCHAT
I've been enjoying it too.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's get some light on the ground as well.	O
There's some bright light hitting the pavement.	O
Yeah exactly, we are.	O
I'm going for a soft pastel kind of look.	O
So there's these kind of streaky shapes.	O
I think it's just from water washing down the driveway out into the street, so you get this kind of streaky look down here.	O
So looking at the reference.	O
So I'm going to lighten things up and then I think add the darker streaks back in.	O
I'm just looking at it and it looks mostly lighter, so I think maybe that's a better starting point, mostly lighter.	O
And then we'll add the dark colours then.	O
And then over here on the ground it gets a bit darker.	O
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
Kind of Fanning outward like this.	O
And I'm going to flip my canvas to try to get a fresh look.	O
I've been painting from one angle for a long time and I probably should've flipped it earlier.	O
Yeah, now when I see this, it makes me want to.	O
Bring this a little bit higher.	O
Yeah, that feels better I think.	O
And we see this sidewalk go all the way into this like courtyard area going up to the front door over in the neighbors.	O
And we're also going to get a bunch of plants and stuff over there.	O
So that's an area I should probably.	O
Try to get rid of all this orange.	O
There's a window in here.	O
Something, or maybe it's a door, I don't know.	O
You can also hold Elan use the lasso tool with your brush.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
You know that would really be super handy for me, Michael, thank you for bringing that up.	CHITCHAT
I think I will.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll reprogram that to a different key.	O
I've reprogrammed most of my hot keys to the left hand because then it's like so much easier for me to reach them if I'm trying to figure out where L is on, like looking over at my keyboard.	O
Yeah, that one.	O
I would use a lot.	O
I would use that old time, yeah?	CHITCHAT
And then it goes back to the brush.	O
I probably should have.	O
Got that one set up earlier.	O
We aren't going to need three versions of the brush, one for hard soft pastel, one for medium, an extra soft.	O
Hey, if you.	CHITCHAT
No pressure, but if you would like if you were inspired too if you like.	CHITCHAT
Scribbled like on the paper a little bit with those different examples of those three, I would definitely use it as inspiration.	CHITCHAT
I would use it to help design the brushes.	CHITCHAT
Or if you have any paintings where you used them and you.	CHITCHAT
He didn't mind sharing.	CHITCHAT
I would definitely take a look at that.	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't have a ton of pastels myself.	CHITCHAT
I have just that one set.	CHITCHAT
But it would really help to see I've actually been watching some videos on YouTube to try to see people painting with different materials.	CHITCHAT
And that helps too, but.	CHITCHAT
Ha.	CHITCHAT
Nice project.	CHITCHAT

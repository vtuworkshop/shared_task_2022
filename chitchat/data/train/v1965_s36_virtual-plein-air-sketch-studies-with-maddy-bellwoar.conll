Paid 2D and 3D.	CHITCHAT
They combine very well.	CHITCHAT
So you'll be in good shape.	CHITCHAT
We decide to.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's start with some foliage.	O
Finally, will paint some plants.	O
Let's flip this over 2.	O
So right now I'm working on the left in neighbors area.	O
Or maybe that's still their house.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
This could be just like a really Big House.	O
It looks like it's their neighbor though.	O
And then over the neighbors place.	O
I'm going to start with some.	O
Darker brownish green maybe will put a little shadow underneath there too.	O
And then we'll go from there into a more green green as we get into the real color of the plants.	O
Move our way up into so when I'm painting plants I like to areas that are in shadow.	O
I like to use more of a blue, green, darker color is something I've noticed from doing a lot of photo studies.	O
So sometimes even in a scene where it's not so dramatic, I still like to use this as a sort of how I how I do it.	O
So Blue Green in the shadows and then getting more up into a yellow green as it gets brighter and brighter than that will make it look more like the sun is hitting the plants.	O
So I kind of like the vibe that I'm getting from sticking with this texture throughout the painting, so I'm going to try to resist going and grabbing different brushes.	O
Right now when I paint foliage I have, I usually have a lot of fun with like grabbing different brushes and trying them out, but I'm going to try to stay loyal to this one because I think in the end it might give a nice look, but there is.	O
There's a cool plant up here that's got this kind of leaf, so let's do that.	O
It's a little little star burst kind of thing.	O
Give a little bit of a variety to the type of plants we see here really.	O
Oh my gosh, thank you leave.	CHITCHAT
That would be awesome.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm painting this on a separate layer, thankfully because I want to do something underneath there.	O
There's a part of the architecture that I haven't really paid much attention to yet, but over here we've got a wall that comes out and comes towards us and the color in there's a little alcove in there, so I just want to put that warm ish color behind the foliage here and that will make more sense.	O
Trying to match the reference.	O
We're getting closer to not needing the sketch anymore, but we've really needed it this whole time.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So there's our plants I want to go to a lighter color green.	O
For some of these leaves that are getting hit by.	O
Late.	CHITCHAT
And then if we go down we get more and more into the darker Blue Green.	O
Not sure if I like that I'm going to put that layer behind the other one.	O
I think that's just a little peek, little bright green peeking through.	O
That's that's fine.	O
I would like to go back and do more with this foliage later, but.	O
I want to move on now.	O
There's going to be a fence covering good amount of it, so I don't want to go too crazy and then have to paint over all that.	O
That's the worst, that's sad when that happens.	O
Kind of get attached to an area you paint, and then you realize, oh wait, that has to get covered by a bunch of stuff.	O
So there's some kind of I don't know if it's like a storage cabinet or something.	O
There's some kind of Brown rectangle over here.	O
That's all I know.	CHITCHAT
That in.	CHITCHAT
Part of house, it has a little bit more of a warm color.	O
So let's try it again.	O
Oh yeah, I'll move this back.	O
Forgot about my reference.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
For some reason my shortcuts not working anymore to flip this.	CHITCHAT
OK sorry guys, oh there we go.	CHITCHAT

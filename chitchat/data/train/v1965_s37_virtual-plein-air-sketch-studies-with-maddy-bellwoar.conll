There we go OK, I don't know what I was doing wrong but we got it.	CHITCHAT
Little warm light in between the windows.	O
Maybe nice to paint over the edges of windows so they don't look so.	O
Clean compared everything else in the painting.	O
And we can go even a warmer color for the door, so it's a pretty door.	O
Wooden door with a bunch of details.	O
We're not going to do all the details, but.	O
And get this nice warm color.	O
You can really tell there's a lot of glow.	O
Details on the side.	O
And then gold handles.	O
I think I could add a little bit more light on either side of the door.	O
There's quite a bit of bounce light here, just like we're seeing on the ceiling in the second.	O
2nd floor.	O
Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
I was getting worried too.	CHITCHAT
I I don't know what happened.	CHITCHAT
OK, so there's going to be a fence covering a lot of what happens here, but I'm just going to put in a light background.	O
So what we're doing is we're seeing through the fence into the like the pavement that's reflecting a lot of light on the ground here.	O
So make a new layer and.	O
Pick a color for the fence and we might end up changing this.	O
Till we find the right color.	O
But I think this is OK start with.	O
So let's just hold shift.	O
And make a bunch of.	O
I'm going to keep my brush the same size.	O
So the the slots of this fence will be the same size.	O
This is on its own layer, just have to double check.	O
OK, and then we'll go with a darker, almost black color.	O
Oops, that's too dark.	O
Around the outside.	O
Maybe less saturated, it looks like it's some kind of metal and it's reflecting a cool color.	O
Is the blue Sky.	O
So something like that.	CHITCHAT
It could be a little bit more room the top.	O
There we go.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So there's our fence.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's a little bit busy.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit busy.	O
So what we can do is underneath that layer we can maybe try to make things.	O
Cleaner so that the fence.	O
This, like stripes of the fence, will be easier to see.	O
Or maybe it maybe it's not so important.	O
We can test things out.	O
So the door comes down a little lower so we can have the color of the door coming behind there.	O
Same thing over here.	O
Yeah, we don't see through a lot.	O
I mean, you can't really tell in detail what's going on behind there so we don't have to get too detailed and crazy with our rendering behind there.	O
But yeah, that's a little bit better.	O
Just allude that there's some stuff going on.	O

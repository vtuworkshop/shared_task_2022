Merge that down.	O
Alright, I'm excited that we're getting into more finishing things.	O
It's hopefully going to start coming together.	O
An plants plants.	O
I've been waiting for that.	CHITCHAT
So one thing we can do before we merge the.	O
The fence I could duplicate the layer.	O
If you want a more solid look.	O
Also, we can lock the layer here an add some shadows and highlights like for example if you want the bottom to be darker or if you want.	O
A darker shadow underneath of individual slots of the fence.	O
You could do that, maybe that will help it look more 3 dimensional.	O
So doing the same thing with the holding shift for straight line.	O
And just doing a tiny little bit underneath each.	O
Thing It doesn't take too long I mean, I think it's worth it.	O
You can do the same thing on the top with a lighter color.	O
So color pic from the fence just go a little brighter and.	O
And maybe not every single one needs it, you know?	O
But like a little highlight here and there.	O
OK, I think I'm happy with that.	CHITCHAT
There also is.	O
Some kind of post in the middle which I've sort of ignored groups.	O
Let's get that.	O
So on a new layer will come like this do.	O
And there is a lot to do in the scene, even with trying to keep it simple.	O
Right, so little highlight.	O
On the metal.	O
Metallic area.	O
Thank me by need to move the center over to the right a little bit.	O
Doesn't feel quite centered.	O
Alright, will merge that.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Next Area on the left.	O
Let's get this fence finished up so there's a whole bunch area that's in shadow.	O
We've got some cool and warm shadows here.	O
It's going to be nice.	CHITCHAT
You had the plans.	CHITCHAT
Shadow underneath the.	O
Plant holders Start to make some sense of this area.	O
There's a little flower pot.	O
Weather in.	O
There's also some dappled light, some.	O
Flashes of light and shadow from the tree, which we haven't painted yet.	O
The highlights and shadows on the fence is so satisfying for some reason.	O
Thank you, I'm glad that boat extra detail is worth it then.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Pamela.	CHITCHAT
Claire C.	CHITCHAT
Come over here on the left there's.	O
I think maybe it's the neighbors fence or something like a blue Gray color.	O
Just the basic shape in there for that.	O
There's also a bunch of little little garbage and recycling bins.	O
I don't know if I'm going to paint those in or not I mean.	O
I do feel like that kind of adds something.	O
I don't know well, we're not going to focus on at first, that's for sure, but if we feel like something is missing at the end that we can consider it.	O
Right, so if we're looking at this fence, an 3D mindset, then this side of the post?	O
Yeah, we gotta figure out where the highlights and shadows are, which the sun is coming from the front aiming towards this house.	O
So everything facing the front is kind of really bright like but on the left side of the post here we've got shadow.	O
Little Shadow and then we have to look at the right side of this one is in Shadow and then there's a really intense light stopping right at the corner.	O

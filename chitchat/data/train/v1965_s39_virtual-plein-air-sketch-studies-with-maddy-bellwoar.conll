Where is this image from Singapore from Singapore?	CHITCHAT
Someone requested Singapore last week so I went looking.	CHITCHAT
And this is what I found.	CHITCHAT
Well, I found a bunch of different pictures but.	CHITCHAT
I was searching on map crunch.	CHITCHAT
Which.	CHITCHAT
You know, grabs images from Google Street View.	CHITCHAT
So it wasn't like just a whatever Google images found for Singapore.	CHITCHAT
So there were a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Like residential things and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Hey Donna, how are you?	CHITCHAT
So there's a bunch of.	O
Foliage and plants.	O
Here I think it would help me to paint these in and then hopefully will happen.	O
Is the fence is going to be easier to paint after that?	O
Right now I'm just having a struggle where the background color is not as dark as it's going to be an it's kind of tough to judge.	O
Right, we can maybe put some flower pots instead of the garbage bins.	O
With a little more aesthetic.	O
But sometimes fainting those details can be, you know, make a place look more like.	O
People really live there, and that kind of thing.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So get the lasso tool.	O
And I'm going to select.	O
And hopes that didn't go too well.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to Freehand Lasso.	O
Never mind.	CHITCHAT
So I'm selecting the area that I want to paint within.	O
And we're going to work on the shape of the posts, but I just want to work on the.	O
The general.	CHITCHAT
General area here.	O
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Pamela, I'm glad to hear that.	CHITCHAT
That makes me happy.	CHITCHAT
I hope you guys are having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate the company.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try just painting these and see how they go.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about actually using the lasso tool to select individual like plants.	O
These kind of look like.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
They really big leaves.	O
Let me zoom in.	O
There's almost like banana leaves or like.	O
Something like that.	O
Yeah, that really cool.	CHITCHAT
OK, So what I might do is take my brush and go to the shape dynamics and turn on pen pressure.	O
So this will make it so that you can see what's happening.	O
The difference is that my brush will be go to more of a point and then as I press down more it's going to get thicker so.	O
Let's try that, maybe it'll help with painting these plants.	O
So that way I can try to get more of the shape of them with one individual brush stroke so some of them we get like the little stem.	O
Then the leaf.	O
There's a lot of plants.	O
There's a lot of leaves overlapping, So what I'm thinking is maybe I'll do like layer one of these darker ones, and then we'll add the highlights.	O
The kid lock the transparency.	O
And choose a lighter green and just kind of go over the leaf shapes already made.	O
So that looks a little better.	O
Especially when we zoom out, you gotta zoom out.	O
Yeah, that's OK.	O
We can.	CHITCHAT
We can go somewhere with this idea.	O
Thank you, Lena.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a new layer underneath this and let's let's color pic from the window as a starting point and will go a little darker.	O
And I'm going to use that color back there.	O
And over here.	O
So if you look at the references pretty dark all over here under the.	O
The roof.	O
And behind the plants.	O
So we'll just put more will, put more leaves and for coming in front of this.	O
Going to call it failed hard with this one.	CHITCHAT
I'm posting the whole page so it's even smaller.	CHITCHAT
Jackson, OK?	CHITCHAT
Let's take a peek.	CHITCHAT

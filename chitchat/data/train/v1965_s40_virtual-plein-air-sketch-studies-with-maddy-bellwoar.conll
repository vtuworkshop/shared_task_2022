I don't blame you like this.	CHITCHAT
One is a workout.	CHITCHAT
Oh.	CHITCHAT
That's adorable guys.	CHITCHAT
Check this out so these are Jackson Jokers Studies with us today.	CHITCHAT
You did a really good work today.	CHITCHAT
Nothing to feel bad about even this one.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's the foliage that's bugging you, but I think the House the bounce light in between these floors.	CHITCHAT
That's one of my favorite things about the reference and I can get that turned out really well in your painting.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I hope you feel good about today overall, even if this, even if you don't really like this one.	CHITCHAT
I like the Ibrox Pression.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, yeah, I'm also getting.	CHITCHAT
I have to admit, this one is like tiring me out how I don't know how long we've been working on this one, but it's been a challenge.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I agree Pamela, I agree.	CHITCHAT
All right, we're going to keep going.	CHITCHAT
We're going to keep going.	O
So there's Oh, Oh, I just noticed like a big thing.	O
OK, so this.	CHITCHAT
The roof here.	O
It actually goes up like that.	O
This is lower OK.	O
Can discoveries?	CHITCHAT
I just didn't really pay attention to this earlier.	O
Honestly, I think what I was doing with sketch I said something like, Oh, the tree will cover this so I don't have to pay attention to it.	O
And now.	O
I'm trying to figure things out.	O
OK, so this is going to come down.	O
A little bit.	O
And then we can get some.	O
Little.	O
With little shadows to show the end of the tile roof, there we go.	O
Yeah, that is something I totally missed.	O
Alright, better, OK, we're getting there.	O
Let's add a little bit more, a dappled light, some of these bright highlights are hitting the.	O
Side here and upon the.	O
The roof.	O
And will paint another.	O
Let's see if I can.	O
Yeah, I can go to select reselect.	O
That's handy.	O
Don't have to select that again.	O
And let's add some more plants so this time maybe we'll have the plants coming.	O
In front of this other group, so will start to give a layering effect.	O
Hi Muneer, how are you?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we got this big group and they reaching out.	CHITCHAT
I mean if you look at the reference these plants, they come all the way in front of this window.	O
So I gotta add a lot more.	O
Let's select that again.	O
Re select when we're going to add a whole bunch more.	O
Over here.	O
And we should be in good shape.	O
More plans the better as far as I'm concerned.	O
So I'd like to have some leaves going in different directions there for the most part, they're all kind of like going in One Direction mean they're pretty organized looking.	O
Do we want to get a little bit of a lively feeling?	O
I'm going to turn on color dynamics on my brush.	O
See if that does anything interesting.	O
Color dynamics should give some slight Hue variations.	O
It's barely noticeable.	O
I usually have my color dynamics settings really low.	O
So that it looks natural but.	O
Let's turn it up a little bit.	O
Not happy with the last one, but overall I really enjoy painting along an Mattie.	CHITCHAT
I'm loving how this one is turning out a bit different from the others but still really beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it is different from the others.	CHITCHAT

A little bit less painterly and more.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It feels a bit more.	CHITCHAT
Mega stylized review, where you put it?	CHITCHAT
Happy you like it.	CHITCHAT
I'm enjoying this one.	CHITCHAT
I've been kind of working towards.	CHITCHAT
I've been wanting to experiment with this kind of style for a while, at least at least In addition to other types of painting that I do.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm never going to.	CHITCHAT
Want to feel like, Oh I can only paint one way.	CHITCHAT
I really like trying new things and new workflows.	CHITCHAT
But I see.	CHITCHAT
There's been a lot of more stylized art that's inspired me a ton over these last couple years, especially recently.	CHITCHAT
And it's nice to try.	CHITCHAT
Try it out.	CHITCHAT
And feel like somethings working 'cause I had a lot of attempts.	CHITCHAT
At doing this kind of work on various streams.	CHITCHAT
Feel like it's finally starting to.	CHITCHAT
Get a little bit more natural for me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well I have to add another fence which I'm not super excited about.	O
But here we go.	O
I'm going to color pic from the fence I already have here on the right.	O
And yeah, we use the same size brush and we should be able to do this.	O
Not too much trouble.	O
I'll turn off color dynamics again and we'll just go 12.	O
3 four OK, I guess it wasn't too bad.	O
Ann Maybe I'll just duplicate this.	O
Make sure it's exactly the same.	O
Poop.	CHITCHAT
Really thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like the texture too.	CHITCHAT
It's been a little bit of I feel like I've had to use some discipline to stop from switching brushes, brushes, 'cause I usually like to use a few throughout the painting.	O
But it's help.	O
Things feel more consistent to stick with one.	O
Ha feel like I've walked by this house in South Florida in Miami.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's interesting.	CHITCHAT
You say that because when I was looking for references so this the reference is actually in Singapore and somebody requested last week to do a place in Singapore.	CHITCHAT
So I was looking for that an when I was going through on the Google Street View Thing.	CHITCHAT
I was really surprised because I you know, if anybody doesn't know, I kind of grew up in South Florida.	CHITCHAT
I spent a lot of years living there and it reminded me there was a lot of houses with like tile roofs and just kind of similar architecture and some similar plants and things.	CHITCHAT
So I yeah, I thought I kind of had the same feeling which is funny, like of course there's a lot of differences too.	CHITCHAT
But I noticed some similarities that surprise me.	CHITCHAT
So bitter about more fences haha right like come on, I'm done with the fences.	O
Almost though almost we're going to add a little highlight to this.	O
Also dispense also be somewhere.	O
Needs a little bit of light hitting.	O
I think this is one of my favourites.	CHITCHAT
The depth of the floors is drawing me right in.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Oh	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to lock that layer and maybe I went a little overboard with the highlights.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Will go over some of those that.	O
The shadows are also clear.	O
OK, so God Fences.	O
And we need to bring this wall up now so that this makes this is nice and flat.	O
There shouldn't be that much space.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
The bright white lights I'm going to color pic from the reference 'cause I'm very curious what that color is of the wall in the shadow had how far to?	O
Oh, it's actually not that bad.	CHITCHAT
I was curious if my value was really off.	O
It's actually not that bad.	O
OK.	O
It just felt wrong.	O
For some reason.	O
I wasn't sure if this shadow was right, but maybe we can just work on the transition between the highlight in the shadow.	O
Maybe that'll help.	O
Matt is on the fence about more fences, basically.	CHITCHAT

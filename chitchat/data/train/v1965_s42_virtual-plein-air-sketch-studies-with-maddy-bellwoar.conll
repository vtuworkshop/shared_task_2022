A Spanish common in South Florida?	CHITCHAT
Yes, yes.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people speak Spanish there well, there's a lot of people from Spanish speaking countries that live in Florida.	CHITCHAT
And so.	CHITCHAT
Then They have that background and no speak Spanish and a lot of people because of that.	CHITCHAT
Also want to study Spanish because it's a good thing to know in that in that area.	CHITCHAT
So yes.	CHITCHAT
Offense Madness.	CHITCHAT
OK, so a little bit of a darker.	O
Shadow underneath the.	O
So this comes down this matches up here.	O
Alright, I'm excited to get these little.	O
Planters.	O
So full of plants.	O
It's going to be really cute, I think.	CHITCHAT
Ah, I just notice something.	CHITCHAT
So I can bring this fence a little bit further over.	O
On top of that.	O
That will help.	O
Hopefully with the depth.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's start with the plants.	O
So I think my sketch layer has.	O
Yeah, you can see that things have moved a bit from where I sketch them in.	O
But we did have a little planters like that.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Make a new layer and.	O
Color do we want this?	CHITCHAT
Is going to be really cool because the plants are just like my favorite kind of effect.	O
The plants are partially in Shadow and partially in highlight, so I'm going to right now.	O
I'm going to only focus on the shape of the plants first.	O
I'm not going to worry about the.	O
The color, I mean, I'm just gonna pick a random green.	O
And one thing that I think is so cute about these planters in the front is how like puffy and rounded.	O
And just like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I like how the plants look in the front.	O
It's very cute, so we're going to get the shape first like this.	O
And then will work on the colors.	O
Sometimes it's easier to do that in steps.	O
And there actually.	O
So the planters are close together and pretty full, so there just meeting together with the plants are meeting together in the centre.	O
OK, so now we can take the lock the transparency up here I'm going to flip.	O
And we can go with a more like green blue color.	O
Go darker.	O
Yeah, over here it's going to be in shadow with a more of a green blue and then on the right were going to get into like a yellow warm yellow.	O
Then we can have a little bit of a transition there, but the sunlight I really makes the sunlight look nice.	O
Oh, thanks for hanging out with us Michael and thanks for the tips and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy the rest of your day.	CHITCHAT
And we can add some little little leaves.	O
Little highlights.	O
I like to add these blue green highlights.	O
A little bit of texture like this.	O
And then we can.	O
Add some later highlights and we get into the Sunnyside.	O
The more yellow highlights.	O
Pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
And maybe we can have some.	CHITCHAT
I'll turn off the air, turn on the shape dynamics again.	O
And we'll go little bit more of a pointy tip, and then we can add some little spikes.	O
'cause these plants look kind of spiky.	O
This one has a nice book feeling for some reason.	O

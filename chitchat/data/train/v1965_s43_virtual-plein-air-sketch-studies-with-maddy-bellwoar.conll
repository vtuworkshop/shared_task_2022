I can also see a girl with a person walking down the street in a similar style.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should try to add that in.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if well.	CHITCHAT
Well, I know.	CHITCHAT
I certainly won't be able to do it during this stream 'cause we're kind of nearing the end, but.	CHITCHAT
Maybe maybe I can experiment with that a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
So on a layer below that, I do feel like even the white color picked from the reference.	O
It just feels like this needs to be darker over here.	O
I don't know what that is.	CHITCHAT
About But I'm going to darken this a little bit.	O
Yeah, there's some areas that can use a little bit of cleanup.	O
Little bit of polishing.	O
Surround the windows with those hard edges.	O
We could sort of.	O
Go over those with something more textured.	O
That was the area I use the lasso tool for and I think it stands out a little bit.	O
There's some little details on the outside of the door.	O
Congratz Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
Congrats.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're going to.	CHITCHAT
Get a good rest.	CHITCHAT
After that.	CHITCHAT
I could actually raise out some of what I just did there.	O
This is why I like to work on a separate.	O
Um layer and kind of check.	O
Check my work before emerged.	O
Sometimes I find that I took something in that direction.	O
I don't really like.	O
I like to be able to erase out before I commit, so I'll usually work on a separate layer.	O
For awhile and then turn the later on and off.	O
See how it looks and then merge down from happy with it.	O
It gives me a little chance to fix stuff.	O
Hey Andy, how's it going?	CHITCHAT
For anyone just coming in, we've been doing studies today at this third one I think is going to be the last one, 'cause there's still a bit left to do on it, but this is what we did for the day so far.	CHITCHAT
This one was really fun.	CHITCHAT
Oh, at the beginning it wasn't, but it ended up being really fun.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, this is one we're doing right now.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Right, I'm glad we could be with you to the end there.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, we have another fence.	O
My gosh I forgot the neighbor.	O
The neighbor has offense, OK?	CHITCHAT
OK guys.	CHITCHAT
Let's do this.	O
So we're going to make a new layer.	O
It's a different kind of fence, though not.	O
The same style.	O
But we're going to try similar approach.	O
So this is a black fence.	O
Metal.	O
And it's got a little bit of a fancy design.	O
So something like this, it goes off the side of the screen.	O
This is on a separate layer so I can erase away and fix things.	O
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good day so far, Andy.	CHITCHAT
So there's an interesting.	CHITCHAT
I don't know about this design if we're going to get it exactly, but I'm just going to wing it so it seems like something it goes straight and then has little curve at the bottom.	O
Wish I could maybe make one of these and duplicated that might be smart.	O
Thank you Ryan.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Take care, talk to you soon.	CHITCHAT
Do you have an Instagram account?	CHITCHAT
Yes, actually thank you, Ella.	CHITCHAT

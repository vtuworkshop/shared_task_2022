It's I think the link is below.	CHITCHAT
In the description, yeah, it should be there.	CHITCHAT
If it's not showing up or anything, just let me know and I'll post it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
But thanks for asking.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to duplicate that one layer that I made and we're just going to use that.	O
'cause I think that that would be way more accurate than me trying to draw the same curve at this over and over again.	O
That's not going to happen.	O
And maybe it will look.	CHITCHAT
Charming.	CHITCHAT
You know, sometimes it works when you.	CHITCHAT
Mistakes, sometimes it can work.	CHITCHAT
I do think maybe I should have duplicated it to be a little bit thicker.	O
Alright, will merge all the.	O
Details.	O
Yeah, yeah, I can actually, I don't know that he does.	CHITCHAT
He occasionally would stream on Twitch awhile back doing some UI design stuff.	CHITCHAT
Things design things.	CHITCHAT
But it's been awhile.	CHITCHAT
So I don't have like any accounts.	CHITCHAT
He doesn't have any accounts where he shares that stuff.	CHITCHAT
If that changes all, I'll let you know.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is a little tedious, but here we go.	O
We got our pattern.	O
I think that was probably the better way to do it.	O
For the sake of this matching properly.	O
Alright, so I'm going to duplicate that and go to edit transform, flip horizontal so that we get that overlap design.	O
That you see in the reference.	O
Only I missed a couple on the side.	O
Duplicate that edit transform, flip horizontal.	O
Alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, of course I I got it.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh thanks project.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, project project avoid posted my Instagram and chat.	CHITCHAT
Thank you pastor.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy that you feel the Sunny Vibes are coming through with this one.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I want to erase out a little bit where these lines went above the fence.	O
Alright, well we've got our fence.	O
About too much drama.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you John, thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
OK, so there's a few more things we need to do to get this feeling feeling finished.	O
We're missing the tree, so the tree we gotta get the tree in an then.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's the main thing.	O
There's also I honestly don't know what this is over here.	O
I don't know if it's like a mailbox or something, but there's something over here.	O
We can kind of just put in the colour, there's like a Gray metallic thing here.	O
We don't need to understand it, we just need to paint it.	O
Alright, so we painted the thing we can come back to that later and like maybe.	O
Do something else with it.	O
But at least it's not orange.	O
And.	O
Match that down.	O

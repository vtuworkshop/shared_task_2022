Let's think about this tree on the left.	O
So I will work on the branches 1st and I'm just going from the reference an roughly putting the branches where I think they should be.	O
And we can make some decisions to if we think something is going to look better, we can change things up.	O
I like to paint in an erase out when it comes to tree branches.	O
Sometimes I find it hard to make natural looking tree branches.	O
I don't know why but.	CHITCHAT
It helps me to make a paint stroke and then use the eraser to erase part of it away and then it starts giving getting that a less perfect 'cause it when you're using a brush.	O
It has like that perfect gradual thickness and when you erase away then you start getting some more of the natural randomness to the thickness of the branch.	O
So I really like that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you I came, that's really sweet.	CHITCHAT
I'm crazy.	CHITCHAT
Basically.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's bring a couple of branches down here.	O
And the reaching out.	O
I'm not going to paint all of the branches in the reference.	O
I think that would be a bit busy anyway.	O
But just get some basic ones in.	O
Honestly, that starts to look a little bit better, even with just the branches.	O
Even without leaves, that's really helping.	O
The area needed needed this tree.	O
Fig tree.	O
Try to get some branches going in different directions and not just in the same direction.	O
Again, trying to fight my natural urge to.	O
Make the same shapes over and over again.	O
Keep it natural.	O
OK, so we'll have that be the start of our tree.	O
And then I'll make a new layer.	O
Now this might be where I finally have to depart from this brush.	O
I've been using the same brush for the whole painting, which is works pretty well, but these these leaves on this tree are.	O
They've got interesting shape and they've got some sharp angles, so maybe I'll just start with it and see how it goes, but we might end up working with a little bit of a different shape brush.	O
I think it's a door so they don't have to open the big gates all the time.	O
Oh, that would make sense.	CHITCHAT
Wow, my perception of scale is really weird.	CHITCHAT
I didn't imagine that it was something you could actually walk through, but but it could be.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
Looking at map French, it's a bit confusing.	CHITCHAT
How does it work and how do you navigate the site?	CHITCHAT
Oh, let me show you, I'll do like a quick demo.	CHITCHAT
I'll do a quick demo 'cause I've learned a lot overtime about how to use it.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
If you go to the view of the day is really nice today there's always a view of the day.	CHITCHAT
OK, so when you go to the website?	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
If you click go so this is map crunch for anybody like what are we looking at.	CHITCHAT
This website randomizes Google Street View images so it's good for finding random locations to paint.	O
If you're wanting to do virtual Plein Air Painting so when you press go, you'll get a random place like in the world, so it could be anywhere and sometimes look at that.	O
That's really pretty.	CHITCHAT
I like this one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you'll get sometimes it'll be like on the side of the road and sometimes it's nicer than others.	CHITCHAT
You know, sometimes there are low res and you don't know what you're going to get, but you can also.	CHITCHAT
You can go to the options and you can select a specific country if you want a certain look like if you want like tropical or feeling, or you know whatever country here you're looking for geography press, go and then you'll get an area in that specific country.	CHITCHAT
You can also click the map here and then you can drag and drop this little person and then you'll get you'll end up in that area where ever you drop so you can find maybe specific areas that you want to paint and then you can go there and find something there.	CHITCHAT
So all different kinds of stuff.	CHITCHAT
And that's basically how I use it.	CHITCHAT
There's some other things you can do down here when you when you're at the map, and I think the list has it too.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, these settings down here you can select if you want like urban areas, indoor areas.	CHITCHAT
Or if you want it to go on auto and that will make a slideshow for you and you can say how many seconds and it'll like automatically switch to a new location.	CHITCHAT

So yeah, if you are looking for a cool places on there.	CHITCHAT
Like I said earlier, if you use the map, you're more likely to find specific places that you might like want.	CHITCHAT
You might want to paint if you just click go then you can get a lot of the side of the road but just still fun.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of treasure hunt, but if you want to join my discord, if anybody is interested, you can.	CHITCHAT
Click the link.	CHITCHAT
I'll put it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
We have a channel in my discord called virtual plein air, and we're always posting pretty places that we find on map crunch in there.	CHITCHAT
So if you are like feeling like you're spending a lot of time not finding anything good.	CHITCHAT
If you want to skip through that part of the process, you can just join our discord and search through that area like I can show you real quick.	CHITCHAT
Please just ignore all my notifications and stuff, but in the discord you can just scroll back up.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of me and a lot of others in the community, like to post cool places we find with nice lighting or good composition or interesting places, and you can scroll up through these forever.	CHITCHAT
It is a lot so.	CHITCHAT
If you would rather do that than just aimlessly searching, there's some good ones here.	CHITCHAT
We're always posting new ones.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
I know what you mean.	CHITCHAT
'cause when I first started looking for references there, I was also like how are people finding good stuff?	CHITCHAT
How is that happening?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, that's how.	CHITCHAT
That's how.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
That's also true sieve.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can if you want to look for for actual photos.	CHITCHAT
The thing is with map crunch is a lot of times the camera view because of the Google Street View car.	CHITCHAT
The 360, the way that it takes the photos.	CHITCHAT
It creates a lot of distortion with.	CHITCHAT
Like sort of fish.	CHITCHAT
I kind of looked.	CHITCHAT
I personally don't mind it, and I've gotten used to it.	CHITCHAT
But Some people really don't like that, so you can always go to other sources for photos, but I like the map crunch because I like the first of all.	CHITCHAT
I like that there's like literally endless.	CHITCHAT
I mean, well, I guess I shouldn't say Endless 'cause there is.	CHITCHAT
There is a finite amount of photos there, but I mean it's the whole world.	CHITCHAT
There is so much you're not going to run out of things to paint.	CHITCHAT
And also it's good for expanding your visual library because there's you know architecture and geography from around the whole world and you might find things that you didn't know what interests you, so there's a lot of regions that I've come to appreciate more because of doing these.	CHITCHAT
You know which is randomly ending up in an area and being like, wow, this is really pretty.	CHITCHAT
Where is this?	CHITCHAT
You know there's certain places that I've come to appreciate more because of that.	CHITCHAT
I didn't really know what they look like before.	CHITCHAT
So it's definitely some benefits to doing it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if I like this.	CHITCHAT
Method for the tree.	CHITCHAT
Yet I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to keep going.	CHITCHAT
Still will decide.	CHITCHAT
Oh cool, yeah, you should be able to find some good stuff like that, and I know what you mean.	CHITCHAT
I I also live really far away from my original.	CHITCHAT
My original home and sometimes I like to go through there and look at pictures and places to paint and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
You know the feeling.	CHITCHAT
So right now I'm painting the darker sort of background.	O
Leaves that are in Shadow and then we're going to paint a lighter group.	O
Groups of leaves that are getting hit by light.	O
So by starting with the darker ones then we have some room to go lighter and give the idea of depth hopefully.	O
Hopefully.	CHITCHAT
Have an idea?	CHITCHAT
I don't know if this is going to work.	O
But I'm going to make a selection and then try to make a brushstroke.	O
Yeah, that might work if you look at the shape of.	O
These leaves are very interesting.	O
I might be able to use the selection tool to make it possible for me to stick with this brush.	O
I'm really trying to stick with this one brush.	O
By Jackson.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for painting with me.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this one is going to something else.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this could work though.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to try it in a few other places, so I'm going to make a bunch of these little Piney selections.	O
Make my brush stroke within that shape.	O
Do that down here.	O

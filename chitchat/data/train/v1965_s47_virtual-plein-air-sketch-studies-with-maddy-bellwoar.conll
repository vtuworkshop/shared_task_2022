And then whatever you want.	O
Also, it's kind of fun.	O
Yeah, there's a tree finally.	O
Finally.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's make a new layer.	O
I will start with some lighter greens.	O
There really bright, actually.	O
There's a lot of yellow.	O
That looks good.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
My concern is this.	O
I might have to do a lot of.	O
Stuff like what I was just doing.	O
OK, here's what we're going to do.	O
We're going to step one, which is a little bit closer to this color.	O
And let's create a little bit of a glow.	O
Then we'll go with some really bright.	O
Individual leaf shaped things.	O
The idea.	CHITCHAT
OK, it looks messy.	CHITCHAT
Will see if it works.	CHITCHAT
So now we make a new layer or we go even brighter and a little bit more yellow.	O
So this should really stand out.	O
And now we're going to focus on individual leaf shapes and the way it looks like this plant is.	O
This tree is working is like there's a central area and then coming out from that.	O
So let's try that.	CHITCHAT
By Claire Z.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
I know I actually got to go to.	CHITCHAT
This is going a little longer than I planned, so I'm going to try my best to get this tree finish up with the tree real quick and then.	CHITCHAT
I got around here.	CHITCHAT
But I enjoyed the enjoy the stream in the company today, you guys.	CHITCHAT
I will be posting this.	CHITCHAT
Probably here on Behance so I post a lot of what I do on Instagram and also on behalf, but I kind of try to save my better stuff for be hands so I don't post every single thing here.	CHITCHAT
But you can always, uh, yeah there's a link to my Instagram below the stream in the description.	CHITCHAT
And that's where you'll see a lot of my studies.	CHITCHAT
Even some of the more the less polished ones.	CHITCHAT
But I really like this one.	CHITCHAT
I think it has potential, so I'll probably Polish it up a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Post stream.	CHITCHAT
Maybe on another day when I have more time, but I wanted to show at least the end of the process of this tree.	CHITCHAT
what I was going to try to do and I do like this enough.	CHITCHAT
What I'm doing here with the tree that I think is worth it.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit time consuming compared to maybe taking, uh?	CHITCHAT
Some kind of leaf brush and going in here, but hopefully it'll be worth it.	O
So using the lasso tool to get a hard edge on top and then letting the brush randomly.	O
Just end where ends on the bottom, so you get that nice sort of natural jagged edge like the leaves.	O
We can try also just kind of painting it in with a smaller brush that might be faster even.	O
So making a line and then.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
This is a very busy tree, so something I notice leaves will have a couple different.	O
By project thank you.	CHITCHAT
Have a good rest of your day.	CHITCHAT
When you're painting leaves, you guys, there's a couple of different effects that will happen.	O
Sometimes you'll get light shining through the leaf and sometimes light shining off the leaf.	O
So normally what I noticed is when there's light shining through the leaf, you get that beautiful like subsurface scattering effect, and the leaf will be really vibrant and like Super Green.	O
It depends on the plant, but it would be very very saturated yellow, green and then sometimes.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Find Rainier.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you'll get light shining off, like reflecting off the leaves, and that will.	O
That'll be more of a white light.	O
So yeah, I'm not choosing colors for the.	O
For the leaves here, it's going to be vibrant, saturated green for light shining through and then a couple areas will go with bright white light shining off the leaves.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well I am sorry that I didn't get to finish this one.	CHITCHAT

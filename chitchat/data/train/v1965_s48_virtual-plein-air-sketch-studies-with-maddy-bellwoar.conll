I have to admit I knew this one was a little ambitious from the start, but I thought we could do it and it ended up taking a long time because of the details and the architecture so I should probably practice at more of these scenes.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully you guys don't hate them because we can do somewhere together, but will still keep doing natural scenes and other things.	CHITCHAT
Maybe will do some portraits in the future too, so we'll keep trying to mix it up, but I think I'm like about out of time, so sadly I won't be able to get this to 100% of a finished state during stream today, but I'll try to finish it up soon and post it and share it, but most of what's happening from here to the end is going to be polishing, so spending a lot of time probably making leave shapes.	CHITCHAT
And then going through and cleaning up little areas.	CHITCHAT
And maybe maybe maybe tweaking some things.	CHITCHAT
But it is close.	CHITCHAT
We got most of it done.	O
Got most of it done.	CHITCHAT
I hope you guys enjoy the process.	CHITCHAT

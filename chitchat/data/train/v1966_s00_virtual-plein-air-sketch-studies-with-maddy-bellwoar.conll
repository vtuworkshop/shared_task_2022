Hey guys, I hope you're able to see me.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that abrupt ending of the stream, but we're back there.	CHITCHAT
It seems like there's a little bit of trouble.	CHITCHAT
I was having a little bit of trouble connecting with the server, but.	CHITCHAT
It seems like we are good now.	CHITCHAT
I'll keep an eye on things in my in O PS, but hopefully will be able to just continue on from here without too much trouble.	CHITCHAT
So we will just pick up where we left off.	O
I didn't get a chance to upload all of the reference images again, they should be below the streaming description.	O
But let me let me at least put the one where we're doing right now.	CHITCHAT
In the info tab and I'll just put them there one by one when we go to the next scene.	CHITCHAT
But I hope you guys are able to see and hear me if if there's anything weird going on there, let me know.	CHITCHAT
Hello, we're back.	CHITCHAT
Thanks guys welcome Koons Ryan Barack, thank you, sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
So we'll just continue.	O
We were just starting the sketch for this first reference image.	O
So I will pick it up right there.	CHITCHAT
Let's go, let's go.	CHITCHAT
So we've got this layer alright.	O
So working on proportions just get trying to get the mean.	O
I mean proportions or placement of things on the House.	O
So it's OK if it's not 100% perfect.	O
This isn't an architectural rendering, so we just kind of want to get the feeling of it an.	O
That we can do free hand I think.	O
Hi Robert, Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, things seemed to be going better.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we've got the roof little tile roof.	O
And there's going to be a bunch of plants.	O
That's something that really attracted me to this scene.	O
Is this cheerful little Bush is and flowering plants.	O
So I like this shape in the front of this.	O
This one type of Bush that's kind of rounded looking and.	O
Very very small little leaves so it almost looks like one solid green fuzzy shape from the distance.	O
And I mean we can go all the way down here or something like that and then above that there's another.	O
So this is where I might start to erase away the shape underneath where we no longer need that line.	O
All race that away so it's easier for me to see what I'm doing and then we'll.	O
Had some more little Bush is.	O
There's a flower group of Flowers here, so as you can see, I'm just putting in the shape of what these the shape.	O
The area that these plants are going to take up, rather than drawing the actual plant.	O
It just kind of drawing it outline space for them, so ends up looking very cartoony, which is kind of fun.	O
But I'm just trying to block in the area that I know I'm going to use for painting these these plans.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
He's big, Flowery Bush is up here.	O
They're going to have a little bit more texture, be a little bit more random.	O
So we do see the line of that house over there.	O
OK, and the stairs I should probably pay a little bit of attention to these.	O
Make sure that they make sense.	O
Perspective Wise.	O
OK, that'll work, I think.	CHITCHAT
Hi Akash, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome anyone who's just getting here.	CHITCHAT

You can find the reference images below.	O
The stream in the description if you want to take a look at them or if you want to join in and sketching.	CHITCHAT
So there's something here I'm not sure what exactly that is.	CHITCHAT
I think it's something to do with the water drain pipe, so.	O
Yeah, we'll sketch it in.	O
There's a little birdhouse that's Cute.	O
Somewhere over here.	O
Cute little birdhouse.	CHITCHAT
That's the kind of thing that you know.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe, maybe it's even a mailbox.	CHITCHAT
Might be actually mailbox.	O
That kind of looks like a birdhouse.	O
Yeah, I think that's what it is.	CHITCHAT
Funny.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but we could add in an extra little, you know those little little details that you can sort of exaggerate if you like them.	O
Maybe I'll add a couple of bird houses or something.	O
I think this is the kind of house that would have preferred times.	O
I've got a big fluffy Bush over here.	O
Something like this?	CHITCHAT
And got a little bit of A.	O
Like a rose Bush or something, but you know, we could add some fines crawling up the house.	O
A little artistic license there.	O
I like these plants over here.	CHITCHAT
There's some.	O
Plans with a different type of leaf like sort of like a palm leaf type plant.	O
Warlock works perfectly fine.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you want me to call you Warlock?	CHITCHAT
You can change your name here to Warlock if you want.	CHITCHAT
It's really hard for me to like.	CHITCHAT
Remember when people want me to call them something different than their name in the chat.	CHITCHAT
It's just.	CHITCHAT
It's just hard for me to register that I'll try my best, but you can actually change your name here if you want to be called something different.	CHITCHAT
That way it'll be easier for people to call you that.	CHITCHAT
I Samuel, what drawing tools are you using?	CHITCHAT
I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22 that is my drawing tablet.	CHITCHAT
I'll type it in the.	CHITCHAT
The chat.	CHITCHAT
How often would you say you exaggerate or make stuff up off pattern?	CHITCHAT
Oh, OK, so historically I would say not that often, but more and more lately I have been trying to get comfortable going off the reference here and there and personalizing things a bit.	CHITCHAT
I felt a little bit less comfortable doing it when I.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, when I was kind of newer to this and I felt like well when I would try to go off the reference.	CHITCHAT
My I didn't like the results I but as I've gotten more practice and more experience, I feel like I can go go off the reference a little bit more successfully.	CHITCHAT
So I've been trying to experiment with that more and more lately.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, it has been happening.	CHITCHAT
I would say I would say with each painting there's possibility that change something on a very minor scale, like adding extra flower Bush or something like that.	CHITCHAT
But when it comes to big changes, I would say I don't do a lot of big changes when I'm doing studies 'cause then.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm really trying to just learn from what's there, but I am starting to change little things more and more to my preferences.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping that that's something I will get better at doing and get more comfortable doing the more I do this, so I would like to do it more.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to zoom in a little bit.	O
Bring this down.	O
And get caught up often feeling like I'm cheating.	CHITCHAT
If I go off the reference.	O
Oh, that's funny.	CHITCHAT
It's interesting how people have different.	CHITCHAT
Like for some people they have to fight the urge.	CHITCHAT
Like for me if anything I have to fight the urge more often or the feeling more often that I'm cheating.	CHITCHAT
If I do follow the reference.	CHITCHAT
And now now I want to just be clear on this.	CHITCHAT
That's sort of like a.	CHITCHAT
That's something that used to bother me.	CHITCHAT
Earlier on when I had kind of a misconception that artists had to like, create everything from scratch and the misunderstanding about references, then I had that sort of feeling.	CHITCHAT
Nowadays I I have a very different view on that and I understand the most professional artists are using reference most of the time at least to inform their work, even if they're not recreating that scene exactly.	CHITCHAT
They're using that as a very strongly as a guide for how to do a good lighting, or how to paint this kind of.	CHITCHAT
Animal, like it's it's totally a regular, normal and a good part of a process to to use reference, but I used to be more on the other side of things and think like I had to come up with everything on my own so now I'm happy to be more on that side the other side.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I cash is better, I thought were luck would be easier for you.	CHITCHAT
That's my name on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
Now I know who you now I know who you are and that's good.	CHITCHAT
I'll try my best to yeah if I can call you at cash then that's easier for me.	CHITCHAT

'cause yeah, it's hard for me to remember to say something else when I'm reading your name.	CHITCHAT
So if you're good with it I'm good with it.	CHITCHAT
We are doing right now.	CHITCHAT
Let's see where this one is.	CHITCHAT
We've got a few different countries represented in our studies today.	CHITCHAT
This is do I think we're in.	CHITCHAT
North northwest Spain right now.	CHITCHAT
That's where this house is located.	CHITCHAT
If you want.	CHITCHAT
If you look below the stream in the description, the first link there is the map crunch.	CHITCHAT
Link to this location so you can actually click on that and like sort of wander around the area if you want.	CHITCHAT
If you want to like, take a closer look you can.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I better get going with the painting 'cause I'm having way too much fun with this sketch.	CHITCHAT
We're going to run out of time if I keep going on this.	CHITCHAT
Hey David, good to see you welcome.	CHITCHAT
That actually, that's true too.	CHITCHAT
Guess I swap back and forth.	CHITCHAT
Gotta be less Harden ourselves.	CHITCHAT
I know, right?	CHITCHAT
It's true artist so it can be really it.	CHITCHAT
We can be really ourselves.	CHITCHAT
Not very, very high expectations.	CHITCHAT
Trying to get comfortable with the learning process and the mistakes that come along with it.	CHITCHAT
OK, like these, these little houses in the background here.	CHITCHAT
Do Brazil.	CHITCHAT
I would definitely be open to that if you guys find any good images from an area you'd like me to paint using the.	O
Using a map crunch or pixels and Unsplash those those are Rosie free images we can use.	O
You're welcome to post.	CHITCHAT
There's a there's a channel in the discord suggest suggest references.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, suggest topics you can post that stuff in there if you want and will consider it for upcoming upcoming streams.	CHITCHAT
One of the ones I have today is from Singapore and that was somebody requested Singapore last week.	CHITCHAT
So I do try to take the suggestions into account.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Will put this layer on multiply an lower the opacity of the layer so we can barely see it.	O
I'm going to be painting this with just the sketch as a guide.	O
Will see if the.	CHITCHAT
We'll see if the sketch ends up being.	CHITCHAT
In the final one, usually not, usually, not for me.	CHITCHAT
Haicheng, oh, don't worry, we're going to do more sketches depending on how much time you have to hang out those today planning to do, I'm going to attempt doing four of these studies so they'll be more sketching going on for the next one.	CHITCHAT
Hi Elena, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I hope you have a good day too.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
So I've been experimenting with a little bit more of a traditional workflow lately, so that includes doing full like underpainting and everything, so I choose a color usually.	O
If I'm painting a sunny scene, it's going to be something like this.	O
It's going to be something like a warm glow color that gives a feeling of a warm glow and just sketch that in in the background like this.	O
I hate Francesco, welcome.	CHITCHAT
No worries.	CHITCHAT
We only just started.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of stream left to go, so it's you're here at a good time.	CHITCHAT
Don't worry.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for coming over.	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to start with painting the Sky.	O
So I like to paint the Sky first for a few reasons.	O
I feel like it helps set the.	O
Set the tone for the whole painting the whole scene.	O
Because the Sky is going to tell us about the time of day, about the weather, about the overall mood and lighting.	O
So we do the Sky 1st and then we're set up to have, you know will be able to know what kind of colors to paint, everything else, how the light is going to affect those other objects.	O
So that's why I like to do this guy first.	O
Also, generally it's the furthest thing away an I like to work back to front.	O
Layering so that also makes sense.	O
So I try to create a little bit of a gradient in the Sky, but painting with A textured brushes a little bit harder to get a gradient.	O
You can always do it with a big airbrush and that'll be nice and smooth.	O
A Samuel says when creating, do you use this screen on your tablet and a larger screen like a computer or laptop?	CHITCHAT
I'm looking into cheaper alternatives like the welcome intuos pro, yes, so my setup is the I have the Wakeham Centriq 22 so it's a screen tablet so I'm drawing on the screen and then I do use another monitor also.	CHITCHAT
Actually when I first was getting into digital I had my centriq one other monitor.	CHITCHAT
I'm streaming, I got another monitor so I have two extra monitors other than my tablet because I have the streaming software and other things on there you don't necessarily need that for me.	CHITCHAT

I was doing great with one monitor and my synthetic and that was like a great setup.	CHITCHAT
So, but yeah, that's what I use.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so that depends on the person Samuel.	CHITCHAT
So when it comes to having a screen, tablet or non screen tablet alot of professional artists use the Intuos line.	CHITCHAT
The one you're talking about.	CHITCHAT
It has a great pressure sensitivity.	CHITCHAT
That's the most important thing.	CHITCHAT
A lot of people say that they get.	CHITCHAT
You get used to drawing sort of drawing on the mouse pad kind of thing looking up at the screen but you get used to that overtime.	CHITCHAT
I personally thought it was difficult.	CHITCHAT
I had borrowed an intuos from a friend and tried it out.	CHITCHAT
And I ended up saving up and getting SMT 'cause I found it difficult.	CHITCHAT
However, I that was a very brief experiment with the intuos.	CHITCHAT
I think if I had maybe stuck with it and kept working with it to get through that initial awkwardness, maybe it would have been fine for me.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to say 'cause usually when I talk to people, that's what they say.	CHITCHAT
It was weird for awhile and then they got used to it.	CHITCHAT
So it depends on your budget.	CHITCHAT
If and what you want to do there, there's a lot of options.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well let's go on to the house.	O
I just want to get everything blocked in in a simple way as soon as possible.	O
So what I try to do is work.	O
Like I said back to front but also big to small.	O
So the next thing that I'm doing after the Sky is looking at what should I do next?	O
And so I'm thinking these houses or the are very big shapes and their important.	O
I mean this is what the scene is about really.	O
So I'm going to try and block these in pretty quick.	O
And I'm looking at subtle color shifts.	O
The This area close to us that looks like a little bit of a shed or something that's attached to the house.	O
This one has a little bit of a blue kind of tint to it.	O
This building back here is a little bit of the Brown.	O
It is differentiating a little bit and the style that I'm going for is kind of.	O
A little bit of like a plane air.	O
Egg wash type painting style.	O
This is I started getting into this.	CHITCHAT
This medium in traditional and it's definitely influenced my taste in digital art.	CHITCHAT
I've been trying to.	CHITCHAT
Kind of match my digital art to that traditional vibe.	CHITCHAT
Do you need performing computer to work with this antique?	CHITCHAT
Yes they do have a.	CHITCHAT
I forget what it's called.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a mobile studio.	CHITCHAT
The Wakeham Mobile studio.	CHITCHAT
If you get that then it has processor and everything and it's like an all in one thing and you don't need a PC.	CHITCHAT
But for the model that I have the Centriq 22 and for most of their sentix you do have to have attached to a PC.	CHITCHAT
It's not going to just run on its own.	CHITCHAT
The brushes I'm using right now are not the exact ones that are linked below.	O
The ones that are linked below that was my go to set for about a year and a half.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of really good brushes in there, but the ones that I'm using today and that I've been using on stream lately are.	O
It's a pack of brushes that I'm working on creating.	O
I've been working on them as fast as I can.	CHITCHAT
I know it's taking awhile, but I've only been able to work on them here and there, like on the weekends and stuff.	CHITCHAT
So I'm chipping away at it, but I am going to make this brush pack available for for people to Purchas if you're interested in the future.	CHITCHAT
I'm just tweaking some last things.	CHITCHAT
There's a couple more textures I want to include in this brush set that are not yet represented so.	CHITCHAT
That will come in the future.	CHITCHAT
But the ones that I'm using right now, there's nowhere to download them yet.	CHITCHAT
Do you sample the colors from the photograph?	CHITCHAT
I do not.	CHITCHAT
You certainly can.	CHITCHAT
I don't simply because I'm trying to practice.	CHITCHAT
My ability to like look at a color and figure out what it is.	CHITCHAT
So I I believe that helps with understanding of color and just overall speed of painting and comfort with getting creative and going off of the reference image with a little bit more of your personal.	CHITCHAT
Um preferences, but I don't like.	CHITCHAT
I know some people feel very strongly against color picking one way or the other.	CHITCHAT
Like it's cheating.	CHITCHAT
I do not believe that the reason that I'm not doing it is simply for practice, not because I think color picking is evil or something.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
It absolutely will letisha when I release this brush pack.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be I will make appropriate version also.	CHITCHAT
You can't, yeah yeah I will do that.	CHITCHAT
I'm creating it 4 photo shop but will do will do appropriate version.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Ryan.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Uh, with email, been using the Internet since 2014.	CHITCHAT

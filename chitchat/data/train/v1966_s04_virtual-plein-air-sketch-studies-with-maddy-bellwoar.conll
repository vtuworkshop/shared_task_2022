After a lot of years feel they need to get a screen tablet.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for Chiming in, you guys.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you have any.	CHITCHAT
If you have any particular.	CHITCHAT
Experience with a different tablets and you want to share that for people that can be really helpful.	CHITCHAT
Because everyone is different and it helps to hear from.	CHITCHAT
Hear from people that have tried the different ones, 'cause I've only tried.	CHITCHAT
I know I haven't tried every kind of tablet out there.	CHITCHAT
So maybe you guys can notice from looking at my painting, but I tend to start with midtones.	O
I don't necessarily jump into really, really bright colors right off the bat.	O
I guess this this white here is fairly bright.	O
But I usually kind of start with Midtones and then we get to shadows and highlights and things get more contrast that as we go, but they're pretty.	O
Pretty tame at the beginning.	O
I'm also trying to get rid of this underpainting as soon as possible.	O
I do want it to show through in little places like it is showing through, but I don't want big big blobs of orange 'cause that makes it hard to understand what's going on, so I'm going to block in the plants and get that stuff in soon.	O
And so each stare at each step on these stairs that's facing towards us is going to be darker.	O
The ones facing up towards the sun will be nice and bright, so.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
Over here in the garden, things get a little bit darker.	O
There's some shadows.	O
That's going to be a tricky one, so I like to paint when it comes to foliage.	O
I like to paint dark to light, so I feel like I like how it looks and I feel like you can.	O
Kind of get through it a little bit more easily that way.	O
Uh, my question about the computer was Do you need a very performing computer to run Photoshop and this antique?	O
Oh, I see uhm.	CHITCHAT
Photo shop.	CHITCHAT
So I can link you to a page of the.	CHITCHAT
I think I think this is.	CHITCHAT
On the Adobe website photo shop system requirements, I'll link you to this because.	O
Um, what I my, my PC.	CHITCHAT
I've kind of upgraded beyond what's?	CHITCHAT
The minimum requirement for using photo shop, for example because I have to stream also and that takes extra processing power.	CHITCHAT
I'm not 100% sure on like what exactly would be the minimum requirements for example, but Adobe has that information, so I'm going to link you their website in the chat where it talks about that.	O
I don't know that using a centriq means that you have to have more processing.	CHITCHAT
I think it's more about running the program anytime you have more processing power or better graphics card, that's going to create.	CHITCHAT
Less and less lag for you when you're painting, so yeah, I hope you hope that website will help you.	CHITCHAT
I don't have the the knowledge to go into that in anymore detail.	CHITCHAT
I think yeah, the better computer you have, the faster and easier things will be to use.	CHITCHAT
That's true always.	CHITCHAT
I cash as I have a question.	CHITCHAT
I recently started digital painting and I keep hearing that you need to sharpen the tip of the Stylus.	O
Uh, well it depends on what.	O
Kind of Stylus are if you're using a welcome you don't.	O
You don't need to sharpen anything, you have to change the nib.	O
So here if you see there's like it might be too small to see, but there's a tiny little nibs sticking out right at the top of the pen and you have to pull that out and put in a new one every so often.	O
But depending on the person you go through them at a different rate.	O
Like for me, it takes a really long time to go through and if, like maybe a year or more, I can't even remember the last time I changed one.	O
But I don't.	CHITCHAT
I have my settings set so that I don't have to press very, very hard to get to full opacity with my brush.	O
I do that for my wrist health so that I don't have to press really hard and hurt my hand.	O
'cause artists end up with these kind of problems.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hi are a welcome.	CHITCHAT
Do you ever paint on the iPad every once in awhile?	CHITCHAT
I do.	CHITCHAT
I got an iPad for Christmas which was very very generous gift and I have played around with it here and there but mainly what I was excited to use it for was kind of like when I'm out and about which with everything going on in the world right now hasn't really been the case.	CHITCHAT
And when I'm home I prefer to use the.	CHITCHAT
I prefer to use my Santee can photo shop and my most comfortable setup.	CHITCHAT

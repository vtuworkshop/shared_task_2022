So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe when it's more possible to travel and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I'll be using the iPad more.	CHITCHAT
Let's see when painting.	CHITCHAT
Do sometimes choose colors not on the image to have a better color harmony on the final painting.	CHITCHAT
Yes, that's a good question.	CHITCHAT
I do.	CHITCHAT
I just do I just kind of go based on feel an instinct and breath, personal preference.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I'll change something up that I think will look better, but it's not really based on anything.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it it might be based on some color theory knowledge that I have, but I'm not really asking myself necessarily just to be honest with you, I don't really.	CHITCHAT
I think to myself I should add a complementary color here, but it's more like I'm just looking at it and making decisions based on what I feel like it needs.	CHITCHAT
Like ha.	CHITCHAT
This might work and I try things like that.	CHITCHAT
I have my nips for two or three years.	CHITCHAT
I also know some people to change every two months.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's pretty wild.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how that happens.	CHITCHAT
Been using the same names for about six months, is still going strong.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you'll know when it's time to change it so the couple times that I have had to change my nib, what happens is suddenly it feels very scratchy like you'll make a brush stroke and it'll feel like you're scratching your tablet, which shouldn't actually scratch it, but it's just a bad feeling the way it feels like it's scraping or something, and then you'll notice that, oh, it's like flattened or something is weird with it and then you can change it.	CHITCHAT
You'll usually know by feel if it's time to change it, but yeah, mine is going strong for a long time now.	CHITCHAT
All right, trying to get all these greens in now my painting so far is a bit more muted than the reference, so it'll probably get a little brighter as we go.	O
But I kind of like the feeling we're getting here, so maybe we'll keep going with that.	O
I'm going to switch to brush.	O
That will give me a little bit more.	O
Ability to do some of these smaller details.	O
Do usually paint the shadow of the objects, bushes etc before the object.	O
Uh, it depends.	O
Sometimes I know this is kind of annoying answer, but the truth is that it will depend on the scene.	O
Sometimes you just look at the individual scene and sometimes it strikes me that it will be easier to do it one way or the other way so there isn't an answer for every single time that I'm going to do something in a certain order every single time.	O
Mostly I like to go dark to light, so usually I think I like to sort of block in the object that I'm going to be painting and then add the shadow underneath.	O
Most of the time, but it's possible it could go in another order.	O
Archer on that's a lot.	CHITCHAT
That's a lot of Noobs, and they're not super cheap either.	CHITCHAT
Do you have any suggestions on how to best learn to use brushes to their full extent?	O
The extent of options can be a bit overwhelming, So what I would say is one thing that's really helpful in understanding brushes is just playing with this palette.	O
This is if you go up here when your brushes selected you, bring up the brush settings palette and you can just.	O
I would say go through these things and just like change them and see what happens.	O
Just pick any brush that you have and maybe not our round brush because some of the options won't be really obvious.	O
As obvious what's happening with a round brush, you need something that has like a sort of.	O
More unusual shape, but pick up brush.	O
Go through the settings and just see what they do.	O
Because for me a lot of what I've learned about brushes has been through trial and error, just messing around with them in the settings and seeing if I can.	O
Discover something because.	CHITCHAT
Before I got into making my own brushes, I kind of the kind of gateway to that was like personalizing brushes from other brush sets, like just taking brushes that already exists, an trying to tweak them to better suit a situation, so that might be a first.	O
Like the first thing to try is like messing with a brush settings on brushes you already have, but just remember, like, well, as much as I love.	O
I love using brushes on like a big I love to experiment with textures and brushes, but.	O
Don't feel like if you don't feel ready with it if it doesn't feel like it feels like it's confusing and not helping you, you can always just stick to the basic brushes.	O
Brushes aren't the most important thing.	O
They're kind of like texture to me is sort of an icing on the cake.	O
The most important thing is going to be your composition, your color, knowledge, or.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT

Your values, like the darks and lights in your image and then the textures are going to be like an ice icing on the cake kind of thing so don't feel like you have to force yourself into getting into all this fancy stuff with brushes if it's not really not really vibing with it, it'll come.	O
You don't have to force it.	O
Oh cool, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I cashed it sounds good.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're going around the windows.	O
I'm going to take a peek at what time it is I know we had a little tech thing.	CHITCHAT
I do restart the stream so we might end up taking a little bit longer on this one because of that.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully will be able to stay on track.	CHITCHAT
What size of the image on your centriq that you work on, so I think.	O
My resolution is 1920 by 1200 if I'm remembering correctly, but you can make your canvas size whatever you like.	O
You know that's not related to the tablet.	O
So I can just go to image, image size, my current image size is 5000 by 4000 pixels.	O
I made it really pretty big because I want to be able to do like multiple paintings on one screen.	O
I'll tend sorry if this is a silly question, but how do you get the photograph reference pic does it on top?	O
Oh, it's not silly.	CHITCHAT
You can find a link to pure ref.	O
That's a program I'm using for that.	O
It's below the stream in the info description.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, blow this agreement and stream in the description.	CHITCHAT
You can find the info thing.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Natalie I'm trying.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying.	CHITCHAT
I know sometimes I might miss stuff if I ever miss a question in the chat if it scrolled up before I got a chance to see it.	CHITCHAT
Don't be embarrassed to repost it or something.	CHITCHAT
It's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not on purpose, but thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to keep up with it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you is Mayo.	CHITCHAT
Pure ref yeah yeah, if you're F is really handy you can use it for a bunch of stuff, organizing reference images and things.	O
The main thing that I use it for is just what you're seeing here just to.	O
Show a little thumbnail above above photo shop and it's I think it's nice during stream 'cause everyone can see at least what I'm trying to work on.	O
But if you want to see the reference larger, you can find it the link to the reference is also down there in the.	O
In the description.	O
Alright, let's get some color on these roofs back here.	O
I think we can.	CHITCHAT
This is a background so I think we can get away with just basically a flat color on the roof and that's going to be enough I hope.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Block him and distant foliage.	O
Think a nice warm green with a lot of yellow.	O
Make it feel like the sun is shining bright on there.	O
Yeah, no worries.	CHITCHAT
My darken the shadows a bit.	O
I see your sampling lot of colors from the drawing while you paint.	O
Is that for color variation or more smooth transitions from light to dark more the second one?	O
Like you're saying, yeah, I do color pic from my own painting a lot, and usually what I'm doing is blending when I'm color picking an or just.	O
You know, it's easy.	O
Maybe I want to use that color again.	O
But for example, I'll show over here like I'll take the color like this.	O
And then they'll be a color next to it, and so I'll color pic here and then make a stroke Olympic here make a stroke.	O
And kind of going back and forth.	O
And then that's how I kind of create like a blend.	O
So alt alter the color picker paint stroke all to paint stroke.	O
So I'm clicking a lot.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure you can hear it.	CHITCHAT
The keyboard clicks, but that's how I'm doing a lot of the blending like that.	CHITCHAT
And even though it's handy, I do have gotten the.	CHITCHAT
I have heard from other artists and suggested in tutorials and things, something I'm trying to pay attention to is the fact that color picking from your own painting.	O
Well, it can give you like a cohesiveness.	O
Overall, it can also kind of make your colors a little bit more dull, so I'm trying to remember not just a color pic from my own painting, but also to go back to the to the color wheel and add more variations of colors to even when I'm trying to create blends in between colors, adding another Hue in the mix is nice.	O
OK, so let's do something with these windows.	O
Maybe we can make them mostly dark and then add the details.	O
We will make the windows little bigger.	O

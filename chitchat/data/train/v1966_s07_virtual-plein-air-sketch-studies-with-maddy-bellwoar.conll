So we've got a little bit of A.	O
Scion little bit more towards a blue green color there.	O
One thing that's been a little bit hard for me with trying out this kind of style is being left being OK with things being less.	O
Clean like letting things not match up perfectly, but just remembering that when you zoom out and taking the whole scene it can still work.	O
So we've got little lace curtain in there.	O
Very cute.	CHITCHAT
I just want to hint at that and then hopefully when we zoom out it makes sense.	O
I don't know if it does, but that's what I'm trying.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's dark in the.	O
The area around the window.	O
Windows still coming out.	O
Towards us, and maybe that's where I'll use a pure white I.	O
I know some people are against using like pure white.	O
I will ever once in awhile use pure white if there's a situation like this.	O
Those window sills are like the brightest thing in the scene, so I think.	O
Going really, really bright there is fine.	O
A little bit of a darker off white.	O
Still pretty bright, but not quite pure white.	O
For the shadows.	O
And then maybe you can bring that way a little bit up so you can kind of see where the shadow begins.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So there's also shadows of wires, and things will have to put the wires in, so these shadows makes sense.	O
But for example.	O
Can have little shadows coming down the side of the house here.	O
So let's see what it looks like if I turn the.	O
The sketch back up.	O
Yeah, so I personally like it better without the sketch.	O
Some people will work the sketches in or use them in their painting.	O
It kind of depends on the style you're going for, but I try to keep my sketch opacity pretty low so that it tells me where to paint, but the I could eventually get rid of it.	O
I want to fill in more of his garden over here.	O
Go let things be pretty abstract, at least at the base layer.	O
Little dirt in little grasses and things.	O
And then we'll try to bring something out of there that makes sense.	O
More shadow.	O
So basically all these buildings as we get closer to the ground, there's going to be more shadow from the plants and other things.	O
So I want this.	CHITCHAT
It looks like a rose Bush or something is really pretty plant and I want the leaves to be more.	O
I want to stand out from the other plants.	O
I want the leaves to be more blue green like less yellow.	O
So do something like this.	O
Maybe even a darker blue green to make it through.	O
Give some dimension.	O
Pick a little highlight color for with the sun setting.	O
So I've been going over here and selecting the colors, but you can also turn on.	O
Yeah, you can use color dynamics.	O
Uncheck apply per tip and then depending on your settings, let's put this a little bit higher every time you make a brush stroke, it will slightly alter the color.	O
You won't be able to control exactly like whatever it goes.	O
Lighter or darker would be a little bit of a surprise, but it can be nice when you're painting plants and things and you want a little bit of randomness.	O

You want those.	O
Potential for happy accidents.	CHITCHAT
You want to be a little surprised?	CHITCHAT
Just let the color dynamics do whatever it wants.	O
To come up with some ideas.	O
Alright, so yeah that well that that Bush is definitely looking different than the rest.	O
I kind of want to bring that same.	O
I think it's the same type of plant over here, so we'll use the same kind of effect.	O
Speaking about styles do have a painting style like something we can say that's mateys.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think for a lot of artists, including myself, I think it's it can be harder for us to identify our own style.	CHITCHAT
I think a lot of times other people can have an easier time identifying identifying our style.	CHITCHAT
Also, I think I'm going through a little bit of a style change.	CHITCHAT
I've been experimenting with textures over the past few months, and that's something that wasn't a big thing for me before that so.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to say something that somebody might think of as my style that might have changed that might be in the process of changing.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm trying new things.	CHITCHAT
Finding new things that I like that I didn't even know about or care about before.	CHITCHAT
So I think style is definitely evolving overtime.	CHITCHAT
And it's potentially a lifelong journey, like you certainly will have a style.	CHITCHAT
Everyone has a style based on the decisions you make when you're painting it.	CHITCHAT
Just it just happens.	CHITCHAT
You know you're making those decisions.	CHITCHAT
Each brush stroke that you make, even if you're even if you're studying another artist, you're trying to learn from them and you're trying to emulate them, you're still going to have your own preferences sneaking through there.	CHITCHAT
That's just how it works, so.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I love.	CHITCHAT
Painting scenes with a lot of plants, a lot of nature.	CHITCHAT
I know this is more of a subject matter thing than style, but I love bright sunlight, dappled light, those kinds of things, those kinds of settings could be maybe something that people.	CHITCHAT
Might recognize as being something that I do a lot of.	CHITCHAT
So for me, what I'm doing to find that right now Mail is like I'm experimenting with textures.	CHITCHAT
I'm experimenting with, you know I'll, I'll find another artist that I really like and I'll do a master study of their work to try to learn from them.	CHITCHAT
Recently I did a master study of James Reynolds.	CHITCHAT
It's one of my favorite artists, landscape painters.	CHITCHAT
So I tried to recreate one of his artworks so I do feel like I learned a lot in trying to emulate his style.	CHITCHAT
So I think style studies it comes a little bit from doing master studies.	CHITCHAT
It comes from doing photo studies and experimenting.	CHITCHAT
Definitely doing things differently than what you've done before is a way to help figure out style because.	CHITCHAT
If you're trying to evolve something, then you have to be willing to attempt changing it and then see what you like and don't like about that.	CHITCHAT
This is Mattie Bowers Behets.	CHITCHAT
It's a good time, good time so far.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm happy with.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy with the fact that my my style and tastes are progressing because I'm having more fun with my art genuinely.	CHITCHAT
Genuinely.	CHITCHAT
I think it's important to look at what you get in tune with what you like.	CHITCHAT
It seems obvious, but what kind of artworks are you attracted to when you see someone else is work?	CHITCHAT
I know what is it that you see in your like Oh my gosh, I love that I want to be able to do that.	CHITCHAT
You know, if you feel that way, then I think that's a good opportunity to.	CHITCHAT
To try to study what it is that you saw that made you feel that way, try try to do a study of it.	CHITCHAT
See what you can learn from it.	CHITCHAT
See what little things like you can incorporate into your style from that.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't mean you have to.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't think that.	CHITCHAT
It's like you're not trying to copy everything about another artist or or become them, but it's just seeing something you like and saying.	CHITCHAT
How can I learn from that?	CHITCHAT
And maybe incorporating a little bit of that into what I do and doing that whenever you see those kinds of things overtime it ends up.	CHITCHAT
All those influences come together to form what you are and what you create an.	CHITCHAT
So it's an evolution.	CHITCHAT
Let's put these windows in the door.	CHITCHAT

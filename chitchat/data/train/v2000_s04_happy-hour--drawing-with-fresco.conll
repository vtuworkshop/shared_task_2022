Amazing game that I have yet to play.	CHITCHAT
I never even played Animal Crossing when it was on the GameCube would be totally honest with everybody.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's race of this year.	CHITCHAT
I think we're getting there.	O
Was something to add some hair.	O
We're about 20 minutes into that room again.	CHITCHAT
This stream is happy.	CHITCHAT
Hour is 60 minutes of drawing.	CHITCHAT
If I don't finish, it's all good.	CHITCHAT
You can catch the finished product on right here on behancebehance.net.	CHITCHAT
Backslash fresh cake.	CHITCHAT
Just give me a follow or you can catch it on Instagram at eat fresh cake and one of the cool things if you follow me here on my hands whenever I go live.	CHITCHAT
Guess what?	CHITCHAT
It will notify you, especially if you're creative cloud thing open.	O
I think if you're in the hands that tells you too, but it seems like it's only telling people when after the stream it happened, but if you have your creative cloud open.	O
And you are a subscriber to Adobe.	O
It will tell you in a little notification pop up on your desktop.	O
Now many will prepare just.	CHITCHAT
You figured it out now.	CHITCHAT
If anything you are preparing.	CHITCHAT
If you were like.	CHITCHAT
Making your schedule on a live stream?	CHITCHAT
Then I'd say you're kind of prepared.	CHITCHAT
That's what you're doing right now, which would be really impressive if you were doing that and watching and chatting.	CHITCHAT
A whole lot somebody was talking to the last week in the chat about how they find it really difficult to talk and draw at the same time.	CHITCHAT
Alright, going bald guy 'cause.	O
I'm losing my hair, maybe will give us like something I don't know we've been doing like bald slash Mohawk kind of vibes lately, which it's been kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
Something like that I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's like a weird shape that I just made.	O
I like the full bald.	O
I'm gonna full bald in awhile, alright?	CHITCHAT
Again, we're going to create something that kind of like this color palette vibe, so let's.	O
Let's start laying in our line work, let's.	O
Let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Let's bring up this background color is going to use the same color, and let's just get our line or color.	O
Now with our vector brush.	O
I think it was a pink kind of think that I use.	O
Had these usually save, but I'm never sure if I got the right one.	O
It was like this hot pink.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back.	O
Alright, cool.	O
And this is the right color.	O
Looks right, totally, right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's do it.	O
Let's sync up this character.	O
I say ink like I'm like doing it like in a traditional style, let's.	O
Do some vector art.	O
I don't know What is this called usually.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see here.	O
There we go.	O
We can start with hands tonight.	O
Let's do some little different.	O
You know, usually start with a mouth, but sometimes it helps to, kind of like.	O
Start from a different spot.	O
Change the process a little bit.	O
I think I talked about this in the past.	CHITCHAT
Is a really good if you want to dedicate like 2 hours or something on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
There's a really good interview with the guy who made the soundtrack of doom.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And he talks about how you know.	CHITCHAT
Create music you have to start from a different spot, 'cause if you change the process you change the result.	CHITCHAT
That's how you get unique works of art.	CHITCHAT
Really good, you know what?	CHITCHAT
I'll share that actually, in the discord, so they're not part of discord.	CHITCHAT
Be sure to head over there.	CHITCHAT
Give it a follow.	CHITCHAT
It's in the description below.	CHITCHAT
There's like a link to join, and I share all that kind of stuff in the inspiration section.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like how I shared the Neil Gaiman thinks he says last name.	CHITCHAT
I've heard it said two different ways before.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
About you know making good art stuff like that, so I try to post cool things.	CHITCHAT
It's not just all preachy speeches.	CHITCHAT
I also post other art from other artists that people might enjoy.	CHITCHAT
So pretty fun little thing to check out.	CHITCHAT
See what we got.	CHITCHAT
You call drinking too or line work.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, usually called line work like that's what a.	CHITCHAT
I won't call drafting 'cause I'm kind of past that point like we're.	CHITCHAT
We're in like the final stages already.	CHITCHAT
Go to add some wrinkles, a good fresh cake drawing always has wrinkles.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty standard practice for Maine.	CHITCHAT
Gotta have like little folds.	CHITCHAT
And let's start up on the mouth going to make a new layer.	O
Always working layers not destructive.	O
It's kind of nice.	O
'cause then you can go back and change stuff later.	O
It's really helpful for like client work working in layers and stuff like this and keep in kind of a graph, which I usually do at the end again because if they want to change something, let's say like hey we love everything about this but like we really hate that he had like 5 teeth you should have like 2 teeth then you know.	O

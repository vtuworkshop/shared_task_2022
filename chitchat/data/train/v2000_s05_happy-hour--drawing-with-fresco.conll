Then you have that ability to go back and change that quickly.	O
Another sounds like a ridiculous request, but stuff like that happens with client work, man people.	CHITCHAT
People request weird things like.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
They just like you know, sometimes they have.	CHITCHAT
They have their vision in their head and they wanted to be executed and it doesn't make a lot of sense, but whatever.	CHITCHAT
Keep the doors open, you know.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's let's add a bottom Rd teeth real quick before I start really drawn in the tongue.	O
He looks like a Leroy.	O
OK, so we got one name Leroy and roll with that right now.	O
Anyone else got any options for names for this character?	CHITCHAT
What is his name?	CHITCHAT
What is he doing?	CHITCHAT
Why would you snooping give finger guns?	CHITCHAT
And where is he going?	CHITCHAT
Let's add something to the story.	CHITCHAT
Like where is he headed?	CHITCHAT
Midnight gospel on Netflix.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm gonna watch that Ryan.	CHITCHAT
That's a was about.	CHITCHAT
Is it good?	CHITCHAT
Well, I guess you're recommending it would be weird if you recommend it to show that sucked.	CHITCHAT
Or if they want 4 teeth and two teeth and decide they really want for sure that happens to also say that you know better than it.	CHITCHAT
Usually it's like we want 4 teeth.	CHITCHAT
We want two teeth, they have no teeth.	CHITCHAT
Can you make him her?	CHITCHAT
Now we want it to be him again.	CHITCHAT
Where's the four teeth?	CHITCHAT
Usually like the usually the direction.	CHITCHAT
Let's get rid of those guys.	O
Alright, I like trippy can get down that I'll watch it while I drink my liquid death.	CHITCHAT
Mountain water from the Alps.	CHITCHAT
Mike and water.	CHITCHAT
Oh, from the original creator venture, I'm OK now.	CHITCHAT
I'm definitely check that I really liked Adventure Time for the first like two seasons and then.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It sounds really weird to say this.	CHITCHAT
I feel like Adventure Time became too much of itself like what I really liked about the show, started to kind of die out.	CHITCHAT
And what hot topic like the cell started to become like its primary objective.	CHITCHAT
So I slowly kind of fell out of it, but it isn't my queue right now 'cause I want to go back and kind of like get back into it and rewatch it.	CHITCHAT
Also watch it on the Cartoon Network app which want to put this out there.	CHITCHAT
I started that app up this weekend and they got a really cool feature that I think I wish a lot of streaming services would bring to the table which is having the ability to select multiple shows and then it just randomize a stream of all the shows that you really like.	CHITCHAT
It kind of reminds me of like watching Saturday morning cartoons like I don't know what I'm going to get.	CHITCHAT
I can just turn it on.	CHITCHAT
I can start watching and there's always something good so I pushed other apps would do that but it works really well for Cartoon Network's 'cause it's all cartoons.	CHITCHAT
If you one V2V3V4 from yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's when you start getting like final one.	CHITCHAT
Final two, you know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, see always on the creator goes and Sam, I know you're talking about Rick and Morty like I'm, I'm wondering what's going to happen now that they've got.	CHITCHAT
I just got hit with an ad for this actually outer.	CHITCHAT
Whatever it's called the new series that he's doing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, once Pendleton Ward jumped off it just it went.	CHITCHAT
It went belly up.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
For me, you know a lot of people really loved it, but it just didn't feel like it was the same one show.	CHITCHAT
And I've talked about this before that I feel really held to its own was regular show all the way through by JG quintel.	CHITCHAT
Awesome series ends really strong.	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty sure he was around for like the whole thing and then I saw an ad that he was supposed to do in new show for TBS.	CHITCHAT
It was a little bit more like an adult cartoon and I don't know if it ever took off the ground or what happened.	CHITCHAT
It's like I heard about it and then I never saw anything on it ever again.	CHITCHAT
An I watch like a trailer for it and it looks really cool.	CHITCHAT
But you know, I just don't know.	CHITCHAT
Oh dude, that's fine.	CHITCHAT
It's all good.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't going to think that I probably would've been like this is cool and weird.	CHITCHAT
It's would have gotten into it.	CHITCHAT
I thought the episode Dragon episode from Rick and Morty I thought was great.	CHITCHAT
I really into space next one too.	CHITCHAT
I do like how this season like I really like this season of Rick and Morty, and I like that it actually came back around more towards like monster of the week style kind of cartoons.	CHITCHAT
That's like one of my biggest things by Love cartoons so much.	CHITCHAT
I hate when they get too episodic like a really good example.	CHITCHAT

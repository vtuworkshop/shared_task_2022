Hold on.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go.	CHITCHAT
I'm like reaching now hard and preaching to the choir.	CHITCHAT
You know when I reach out to go full screen 'cause I want to like be like the talking cat on the screen, you know?	CHITCHAT
Yes, I like this is Rick and Morty, 'cause I feel like it's more monster of the week, which is why I like cartoons like I had a really hard time with disenchanted the macro ning, you know, new series for Netflix because it felt like they built a cartoon to be episodic and like, not episodic.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like this, you know, like a Netflix series again to follow it and keep up with all the characters.	CHITCHAT
And like I'm super not down with that with my cartoons.	CHITCHAT
Like I like my car.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I like a over arching story through the entire thing and it can kind of take you to a certain place no later on in the season.	CHITCHAT
But like for the most part, I like.	CHITCHAT
My cartoons would be very much like.	CHITCHAT
Here's what we're doing here is we're going in at the end of it.	CHITCHAT
It's over and tune in next week for the next cartoon.	CHITCHAT
I think that's why I like Aqua teen hunger force so much, alright?	CHITCHAT
See I Love Futurama two and I was super on board with.	CHITCHAT
With this enchanted I thought was going to be great, and then I tried really hard to give it a shot.	CHITCHAT
I just can't commit.	CHITCHAT
I know people that love disenchanted, just wasn't my cup of tea, I guess, and I tried.	CHITCHAT
I gave it a legitimate shot and it just didn't do it for me.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll go back.	CHITCHAT
I love Futurama, though.	CHITCHAT
One of my favorite shows of all time.	CHITCHAT
Hands down it's always on in my house I've watched it so many times I can't even count it.	CHITCHAT
Get to that point now where like I'm getting creepy about it like in quote things from it while I'm watching.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
What's your favorite Futurama episode?	CHITCHAT
Let's let's let's talk about that.	CHITCHAT
So my audio is out of sync.	CHITCHAT
I did have a little lag earlier and I will say, right.	CHITCHAT
I've seen that before on your streams to actually an.	CHITCHAT
And so I'm not sure what causes that.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Maybe something to do with My Internet?	CHITCHAT
I've had a few crashes.	CHITCHAT
I got a new router I want to mention this to everybody.	CHITCHAT
I'm currently running on like on a slower connection.	CHITCHAT
There was a bunch crashes.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of mystery as to why it was happening.	CHITCHAT
It came out that My Internet speed is God awful.	CHITCHAT
Not my inner, I mean my interest be actually not that bad.	CHITCHAT
My connection to my router was really bad in my router is starting to go.	CHITCHAT
It's just a big piece of junk up there right now so I got a new one.	CHITCHAT
It got delivered today so hopefully a lot of these like little lags that you get gets fixed, gets fixed.	CHITCHAT
But I've heard that the chat before that my my audio does kind of.	CHITCHAT
Get all funky.	CHITCHAT
Somebody one time said it's like watching an old Kung Fu movie, which I thought was really cool.	CHITCHAT
Duplicate this layer.	O
We're making some circles right now.	O
I don't know if Chris is watching.	CHITCHAT
He had some questions about this a while back.	CHITCHAT
This is how I make my circles since fresco does not have a shape tool had suggested it.	O
Hopefully hopefully it happens.	CHITCHAT
I know a couple people been asking, but this is my method as of right now.	CHITCHAT
How many guys?	CHITCHAT
And let's just so you know what usually.	CHITCHAT
Know how much of fun stuff to make the eyeball like really stand out but not going to do that today?	CHITCHAT
Maybe this one is kind of not like stuck in.	O
Let's have this one kind of float above.	O
Let's just.	CHITCHAT
This is wrong with that.	O
Let's do something a little different, changing it up.	O
I'll keep it interesting, you know.	CHITCHAT
In my pink Yeah, I think mine's on his way out and I'm kind of excited.	O
'cause I realized that like I can send it back to.	O
My cable provider, My Internet provider, and my bill goes down 'cause I rent that thing from them an I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
I've been so foolish as to doing that.	CHITCHAT
Like the amount of money I've used to pay for that router, I could have just bought my own and not have to pay anymore, you know?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's we got our hands.	O
Let's add our arms.	O
For arms.	O
Hey, let's turn off pressure and velocity dynamic.	O
Let's turn up our brush size to about 1517.	O
Why not just going to go poop just like that?	CHITCHAT
Also, when I mentioned I'm using pre release version of fresco really quick.	O
Because I've had questions about how do you do that thing with the eraser with a single swipe, it's it's on my version.	O
It's not out yet.	O
But it will be one day.	CHITCHAT
Then you can use it all you want.	CHITCHAT
I'll put a body in.	O
Do this thing.	O
Oh, I should.	CHITCHAT
Now you know I will do like later.	O
And as you know, I love to draw through all my work.	O

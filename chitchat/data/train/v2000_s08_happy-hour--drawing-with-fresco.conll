I feel like a lot of people really praised the rap up with that show.	CHITCHAT
And you know why Pendleton Ward left.	CHITCHAT
They're actually bothered to like.	CHITCHAT
Look into that I like was so disinterested with the show.	CHITCHAT

Like everybody was like so hardcore into it all of a sudden.	CHITCHAT
It's like like if you went to Comic Con that's everybody was dressed up as Finn and Jake like.	CHITCHAT
That stuff like I apologize if anyone is watching right now, is like a Super Fanboy of a Adventure Time and be like anything in general.	CHITCHAT
But like for some reason and call me like the OG hipster that stuff.	CHITCHAT
I always just get super disenchanted with them in it that it gets like overtly popular, you know.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't sleep wears me out.	CHITCHAT
They're going to Comic Con 2 years ago in New York, and I remember being like really confused because Kingdom Hearts had just come out and every single person was a character from Kingdom Hearts, even if they weren't a character in Kingdom Hearts.	CHITCHAT
The thing that made the character from Kingdom Hearts is that they just carrying around a giant key with them, like how many doors are you unlock and you know?	CHITCHAT
Then I laughed at my own joke just now.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, like I don't know stuff gets it, just freaks me out.	CHITCHAT
And like I'm a huge nerd like I go to Comic Con.	CHITCHAT
I love my comic books.	CHITCHAT
Hum, but for some reason when people get like really into it, I'm like OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm good.	CHITCHAT

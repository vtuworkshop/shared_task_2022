Again, it's one of those cartoons, not for everybody, but I enjoy it quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
Makes me laugh pretty hard.	CHITCHAT
'cause I have a weird sense of humor.	CHITCHAT
Hoops.	CHITCHAT
I think it's been like an Adult Swim binge lately.	CHITCHAT
Their app is pretty pretty robust.	CHITCHAT
I got a lot of content on there.	CHITCHAT
South Park.	CHITCHAT
More and more OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh wait, more than anything.	CHITCHAT
OK yes all parts of good one that's that's a classic.	CHITCHAT
Have you ever watched six days to air or Seven days or whatever?	CHITCHAT
It is a documentary about them and how fast they turn that show around.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty pretty wild.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Here we're rocking and rolling your eyes are ads of detailing.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's up now I know I just work in layers and I keep all this stuff.	O
Usually that you-know-what practice which breach, right?	CHITCHAT
Let's take all these layers.	O
Let's put 'em all.	O
No big group.	O
I wish there was a way to select more than one thing at a time I think I'll talk about that with another person in the chat last stream, but you could just like select everything and then group it.	O
I don't know how that would even be possible on an iPad, less.	O
There's like a tap old kind of function you slid down, but for the time being gotta drag.	O
And then let's duplicate this group.	O
Let's hide this bottom.	O
Once we have our build layer, let's label it.	O
Build.	O
And let's take this one and let's merge everything together.	O
Cool, oh I gotta make a pupil in his eye.	O
Player Make it a vector deselect.	O
Go here go here, it's rotate and line it up.	O
Make it look nice.	O
Google.	CHITCHAT
People time.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, catch up on that, that's why I went quiet.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy the music.	CHITCHAT
I'm catching up on the chat.	CHITCHAT
Those things they do impress the heck out of me.	CHITCHAT
Keeping the current events of Papa Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's that's like if you really watch documentaries.	CHITCHAT
Pretty wild how they rigged all the characters in 3D and stuff like that just to like be able to turn it around so fast.	CHITCHAT
Yeah they got.	CHITCHAT
They got a good thing going over there.	CHITCHAT
And they just keep it super current like it really is.	CHITCHAT
The reason why they've been around being able to stick around so long.	CHITCHAT
And I feel like if they needed to they could.	CHITCHAT
Could you know make up a make up an episode, so to speak and hold their own.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's like something didn't happen.	CHITCHAT
That was current.	CHITCHAT
But it yeah, they just have.	CHITCHAT
They got a good thing going over there.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we got him out with other guy pop some detail we could probably fill color in here too.	O
Shut down.	O
Let's go.	O
Peachy tone like a yellow like no, it's not that one.	O
Is this one?	CHITCHAT
Yeah was it this one?	CHITCHAT
Was the yellow toner used.	O
Let's drag our guy up here so we can make sure we matched that is it.	O
That's interesting, it kept the clipping mask on the bottom.	O
Wild, OK cool anyway, let's fill this guy in.	O
Filament.	O
Kind of socks, does he have?	CHITCHAT
We gave the last guy like a purple tongue.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And then he had white for the eye.	O
This will go White Sox will be thinking.	CHITCHAT
White Sox are so boring.	CHITCHAT
It will do like a.	O
Some different dark blue.	O
Now that hurts my eyeballs.	O
That hurts my eyeballs 2.	O
How's everything her green?	O
Well, that's gross.	O
He's got a space boots that works.	O
Did we decide who is fighting why?	CHITCHAT
The space galactic, whatever pick him?	CHITCHAT
'cause you got finger guns.	CHITCHAT
We know that.	CHITCHAT
But like come on, you can only get so far with finger guns.	CHITCHAT
Like who's the enemy?	CHITCHAT
Who's battling?	CHITCHAT
Light blue.	O
Let's go a little later.	O
I made like a pact with myself or pack, say packed whatever the word is.	CHITCHAT
I promised myself that I would create three similar illustrations each week for Instagram and every time I can always manage to make different colors.	CHITCHAT
Now a dva for what I already did, but sticking with it keeps me consistent and that's, you know.	CHITCHAT
It's always a key part of this whole thing to keep consistent.	CHITCHAT
And I mentioned this in the discord dedicate 20 minutes every day to make an art at least minimum.	CHITCHAT

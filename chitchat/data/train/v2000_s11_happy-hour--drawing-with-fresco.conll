I got a cool graphic like I think Ryan you have one that's like A.	CHITCHAT
That like plugs on another streamers in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I want to do that.	CHITCHAT
It's also getting hard to tell sort of lose track of all the streamers and everything.	CHITCHAT
So many of us were taking over.	CHITCHAT
But it's also for everybody else.	CHITCHAT
Is watching 'cause there's a lot of cool content out there now to check out here on bands and like that does beg the question who's everyone watching right now?	CHITCHAT
What streamers are you enjoying here on the hands?	CHITCHAT
Please let me know.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to hear.	CHITCHAT
It's how I find new people to watch in tune into.	CHITCHAT
We might get pretty pretty close with this guy.	CHITCHAT
And I'll actually take a chance to show how I had the halftone kind of like overlay to create texture and stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna have the time to do that will be really fun 'cause I feel like everybody really enjoyed that last time and maybe there's some new people watching right now and they want to, you know.	CHITCHAT
They want to TuneIn.	CHITCHAT
I know Ryan it is your job.	CHITCHAT
You gotta know who these people are.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
You know, maybe if you could just take time out of your busy life to join my streams and then you just tell people you know, like just Alert me.	CHITCHAT
Yes, there are quite a few of us now.	CHITCHAT
What's the number up to what's like?	CHITCHAT
Do we know we know the actual number of Streamers here on the hand says now?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's add some blemishes.	CHITCHAT
We're coming in on the last few minutes, but we're going to get really close, so this is awesome.	CHITCHAT
That was more helpful than anything.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll showcase it again then.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
That was more helpful than anything I've ever streamed.	CHITCHAT
You were like, that's the that's the clipping mask.	CHITCHAT
That's what I want.	CHITCHAT
Like you waited Sam for that long Sam Two who is now known as an too.	CHITCHAT
Just some little guys down here.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see here this.	CHITCHAT
We're so close to finishing this, I might just go overtime today and just finish it.	CHITCHAT
What do you say?	CHITCHAT
Is it cool if I go over the hour for today, the 60 minute mark and just kind of finish it up?	CHITCHAT
'cause I gotta do is add shading and the texture is everyone down to down to hang for hot sack.	O
I act like I have like this like like if like a commercial breaks into company off at at at the 60 minute mark.	CHITCHAT
And that's not really the case.	CHITCHAT
I kind of actually dictate that.	CHITCHAT
But like you know, eating dinner with my family.	CHITCHAT
Thinking out.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we're going forward.	O
Just finish this dude up 'cause we're almost done.	O
Like I said, we just gotta add some details, some little like, you know, pingshan pangs.	O
Also curious really quick for everyone that's returning.	CHITCHAT
I did the stream on after effects.	CHITCHAT
Everyone find that really helpful.	CHITCHAT
Should I do more of that?	CHITCHAT
Usually drawn fresco.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of my bread and butter here on Behance, but I'd love to show other softwares I know quite a bit about the Adobe Suite.	CHITCHAT
Let me know in the chat if you found that useful.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'll do more of AM.	CHITCHAT
This is true.	CHITCHAT
It is important to self restraints.	CHITCHAT
That's why I have, you know, I try to keep a pretty regimented schedule.	CHITCHAT
My schedule currently is Mondays, Wednesdays, 6:00 PM, Friday at noon.	CHITCHAT
There is a happy hour for the 6:00 PM Fridays at noon.	CHITCHAT
I do a time lapse illustrations I made that we can then Saturday night with fresh cake this week.	CHITCHAT

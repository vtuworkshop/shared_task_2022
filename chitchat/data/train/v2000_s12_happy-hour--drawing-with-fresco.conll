It's at 9:00 PM last week about 10.	CHITCHAT
I'm still toying with what the right time frame is.	CHITCHAT
9:00 PM's been working well for me, so that's what I'm doing this week.	CHITCHAT
9:00 PM.	CHITCHAT
It's usually like two 2 1/2 hours of streaming we hang out.	CHITCHAT
It's good time.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so there's our character, so let's do the shading really quick.	O
When I merge down our detail.	O
We are going to actually not merge that down.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Not do what I just did.	O
Like that spot where is down.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Here's a guy creeping he's walking doing.	O
Let's add some shading.	O
We're going to make a new layer.	O
We are going to go over the 60 minute mark for today just to do this.	CHITCHAT
Guy 'cause we're almost done.	CHITCHAT
This should take about 510 minutes.	CHITCHAT
We were right on the 60 minute Mark.	CHITCHAT
I usually blab for about 510 minutes anyway afterwards.	CHITCHAT
They got any questions or comments or you just want to say hey now would definitely be a good time to do it.	CHITCHAT
And if you don't already follow me home hands, make sure you go to my profile and click that follow button because you get notified when I do these streams.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we just had a little bit of a kind of around the eye there just to kind of give it that that 3 dimensional vibe.	O
Little bit in the ear.	O
And then we're going to bump up our brush pretty high.	O
And get down in here with the tongue in the teeth.	O
It's going to kind of.	O
Follow along with some of the lines.	O
Just to give it a little bit of that, like 3D illusion, you know, little separation.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
We just fill everything in by accident.	O
Do that quite a bit is always forget that I have to like re select my paint bucket.	CHITCHAT
It looks terrible.	CHITCHAT
Meet the tongue.	O
And we're just going to come down this leg.	O
Kind of do like a little little.	CHITCHAT
I want to call to swoop delew.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
That sounds like the planet that this guy is from.	CHITCHAT
It's a very like Justin Roiland Esque.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Way of making up names.	CHITCHAT
I feel what I just said.	CHITCHAT
A Swifty Lou.	CHITCHAT
Well, it's.	O
Here.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Put some shading on the Tao.	O
So whenever I do, my shading is pretty simple.	O
Honestly, it's just like big kind of Blobby shapes.	O
People heal shadow.	O
Back up a little bit.	O
And we're looking good.	O
Can I follow this down?	CHITCHAT
And here.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
Got my discord up in the side here, Ryan.	CHITCHAT
I see you post your schedule.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to tune in tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I'll be there.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
So let's add in some cheating on their hands.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna be ready to wrap this guy up in about a few seconds.	CHITCHAT
They said.	CHITCHAT
He quit doing the shading.	CHITCHAT
Think I said about 10 minutes.	CHITCHAT
I'm at four, so that was fast.	CHITCHAT
Will adding some highlights.	O
It's weird, like Flickr, Dan.	CHITCHAT
I thought like my stream went out 'cause I have the discord like right underneath, oh BS.	CHITCHAT
Right now I just went like all sudden like the thing just scrolled up.	CHITCHAT
Caught my eye.	CHITCHAT
Then you got nice branding so you know that helps too.	CHITCHAT
I really like the colours are using man.	CHITCHAT
They look really good and all the fun shapes and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Did nice work with that.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Let's just kind of add something in down here.	O

Cool.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add in some highlights that'll take.	O
2 seconds.	CHITCHAT
By two seconds I over exaggerate really takes a minute.	CHITCHAT
Add some shading on his butt.	O
Important always important.	O
Cool air going to add a new layer.	O
We are going to lower the Opacity this we're going to select are.	O
Pure white.	O
We're going to put some little.	O
Datsun some things and Pangs and some things.	O
Pop up.	O
That's really hard to see.	O
Probably go even higher.	O
There we go.	O
Here it is.	O
Just add in some greci column grease spots.	O
You can call it whatever you want.	CHITCHAT
We had some changes that hand.	O
True.	O
And then we'll add in that texture, and we're going to probably call today on this guy, so we're almost done here.	O
Like I said, I gotta go off the clipping mask there once they found that really helpful.	O
So I want to make sure you all you know.	CHITCHAT
Catch that before I go.	CHITCHAT
This one last thing.	CHITCHAT
Whoops Select And let's do these fingers have a little something on him, right?	O
Alright, so last thing to do.	O
Make a new layer.	O
I want to show this off a little bit 'cause they did it last time.	O
Everyone seemed really get grab your pixel brush.	O
I'm going to grab the comics brush here and will show off.	O
Have a clipping mask.	O
Works in uh, in fresco so little you know.	O
Learning lesson for everybody.	CHITCHAT
If you go down.	O
Drawn top so I kind of want to have social.	O
These dots are a little thicker that's adjusted with the pressure of the brush.	O
I want to have the thicker on the other side so I could do a couple things.	O
Got either redraw it or I could have put that layer I'm going to.	O
Redraw.	O
Oops, summaries are pretty wide brush to apply this effect.	O
Not getting it right though.	O
Now.	O
Takes a minute.	O
There we go.	O
'cause I like having these halftones is like a texture.	O
Now to create a clipping masks, I only want it on that guy.	O
It's really easy.	O
You just hit this little table right here and boom snaps right to him.	O
Get rid of all that other stuff, clipping mask and now I can take this.	O
Halftone I can lower it down and I got a nice little texture on my character.	O
A nice comic book ascona texture.	O
Grab my eraser, let's erase the stuff that junk in the eye.	O
Just get rid of it.	O
'cause like my my to be clean.	O
No real reason for why.	O
Just personal preference.	O
And you can use those kind of effects in those tricks.	O
For auto stuff you can create some cool shading effects.	O
Definitely explore the pixel brushes.	O
I'm starting to explore them a lot more in Frisco.	O
There pretty handy and like I said, you could do some really cool things with them.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
All right, and I think we're pretty much wrapped up with this character.	CHITCHAT
This Is It.	O
We made made another one.	CHITCHAT
Noob Sandau I was just joshing you earlier, Sam.	CHITCHAT
But how you like the clipping mask so much you love?	CHITCHAT
It's your favorite thing ever.	CHITCHAT
He asked me to do it all the time.	CHITCHAT
Alright, there is our character there is Leroy the intergalactic defender with his finger gun.	CHITCHAT
I don't know who's fighting space Pirates don't know if we ever decided that in the actual chat.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's Alicia was in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I just saw I just realized that another streamer, Alicia, it was in the chat.	CHITCHAT
If you're still there, at least take a second to plug yourself.	CHITCHAT
So sorry like I should have known that my bad.	CHITCHAT

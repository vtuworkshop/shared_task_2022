But today we're going to work on.	O
Just a little illustration.	O
I was kind of playing with the idea of it being a pin maybe.	CHITCHAT
Not entirely sure right now.	CHITCHAT
I think it'll be, you know, it's a little paper ship in a bottle ship in a bottle.	O
I saw someone admitted necklace like this and like this would be a cool illustration so.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to do that and it may not be a thing.	CHITCHAT
I mean maybe a thing, but I just felt like doing some illustration today, so that's what we're going to do.	CHITCHAT
And I'm actually going to turn the Opacity on a little bit with this guy.	O
Down I mean so mean 60%.	O
5250 and I'm going to relock it.	O
I'm going to not have a fill on it so I can track everything I need to.	O
And then I'm going to do control.	O
Alt drag.	O
To put this here, I'm going to make it.	O
A little bit taller.	O
And then we'll grab.	O
This guy Michael Square and connect it all.	O
And.	O
I'm going to work my Pathfinder.	O
We're going to Unite those.	O
Today is today a.	O
And then we're going to want to take the shape builder, and we're going to subtract wrong button every time.	O
How about that does that also though?	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're actually going to let's copy.	O
And paste in place control shift V High that one.	O
Do that again so that I can use the shape builder.	O
But then I also have the shape that I want there.	O
All right, look at that already got that bit done, we're champions.	O
I'm going to do this.	O
And we're going to do this.	O
With.	O
So I'm gonna do now though is I'm going to make sure they're all lined.	O
Oh that's right, Pathfinder Amador.	O
There we go, there all centered now.	O
Which is great.	O
This is going to stay where it is, although I'm I think I'm going to shrink it a little bit.	O
Yeah, that would be good.	O
And I'll probably extend it just for now.	O
This one Luckily can be.	O
Copy down here.	O
Made a little bit bigger.	O
And then maybe?	CHITCHAT
That ish, yeah yeah.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
And like we've already got.	O
The bottom part of her bottle.	O
Work smarter, not harder when you're up during an illustrator.	O
Do I like that I drew this with one tip smaller?	O
do I want it?	CHITCHAT
Probably wanted symmetrical?	O
I feel like that the symmetry here is important, although that I'm like, oh, I don't know.	O
I also kind of like the idea.	O
Maybe the water being a little bit higher maybe.	O
Really come here.	O
The data to do.	O
Got another?	CHITCHAT
A lips up here.	O
Although actually I think I drew it where you can't see the top, so I might stick with that.	O
This is hypothetically a clear bottle.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I almost think that.	O
You wouldn't need to do that.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
And here I feel like I like.	O
Do you need on that one?	O
Oh Still in shape builder.	O
Church.	O
And this guy has to do sort of a dip into this, so maybe I'll mess around with an ellipse and see if I can get that to do that.	O
Why does I want it to be?	CHITCHAT

Maybe this.	O
OK, maybe like that and then I'll do another ellipse here too.	O
Straighten out.	O
So the shipbuilder.	O
And I'll remove these little corners.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to.	O
Do something here so that flows a little better.	O
Pull it down a little bit.	O
Oh That's fine.	O
Then it dental dam.	O
I guess I'll let another ellipse and see if I can get that to work.	O
Set control Y so I can see where the edges are meeting here.	O
There we go.	O
That's what we want.	O
Bump, bump bump.	CHITCHAT
And I will.	O
Extend this lovely guy.	O
So I'm going to take this.	O
I'm going to copy it.	O
I'm going to paste it.	O
I'm going to flip it.	O
OK, reflect it.	O
Not that.	O
Then we're going to flip it vertically.	O
Here's like, Oh I guess it's symmetrical.	O
I didn't have to fit flip it, that's fine.	O
Whatever makes my day easier, Yes, Alright, That's.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool.	O
Now that's there.	O
Now I have to.	CHITCHAT
Bumper Bump Barnum.	CHITCHAT
So then I think the important thing here is, well, it's that.	O
The ellipses are going to change as you get higher up.	O
They get thinner as they get lower.	O
They get fatter, so this one is going to be a little bit more of an angle than that one.	O
And this one, that's why this one is better than this one down here.	O
Although I think this on my could benefit from a steeper angle here, so maybe I'll grab the pen tool and not what I meant to do.	O
Bump bump on uh.	CHITCHAT
So I feel like I'm not as confident with that.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm going to do actually is just going to.	O
Want to recreate it with the ellipse tool.	O
I realize so much on shapes in illustrator which is important in my opinion.	O
So yeah, so that feels like a good.	CHITCHAT
Phillips yeah, so I want it to be more like that.	CHITCHAT
Which is perfect.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to grab these and I'm going to Unite them again.	O
And now it feels better, which is good.	O
And then we're going to.	O
Unite these two.	O
Create this.	O
Just needs me to do.	O
I don't know if I need to do alt to just select this one.	O

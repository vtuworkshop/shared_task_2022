I think no.	O
That's the opposite or shift then.	O
There's one no, not shift.	O
Now I just have to do that.	O
That's what it is.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
So I'm gonna make sure that it is.	O
.01 Side as well.	O
Right there.	O
Luna.	CHITCHAT
No growling while moms unstream rude.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And I wanna make sure one more time that they're aligned centered on the yeah, well, good.	O
And this will be easy 'cause all I have to do is.	O
Make this white and that will hide that as soon as I bring it to the front arrange bring to front.	O
Today a.	CHITCHAT
That's good.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna make another school where?	CHITCHAT
To connect these two that I can.	O
Facebook create the same thing is this and then make it white or we get blue because it's going to be water.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
We're going to keep the strokes for now.	O
Because I'm going to make the strokes.	O
A gold or some are silver or something like that to.	O
To do the enamel pin stuff.	O
Maybe like a?	CHITCHAT
Like this?	CHITCHAT
That feels good.	O
And then bring Miskin Little Guy at Front Range.	O
Bring to front.	O
And then make this.	O
A similar blue.	O
But we're going to make it lighter.	O
Because.	O
Color.	O
Is important.	O
When you know what I'm actually going to hide this right now because we needed to paper ship.	O
And that is important so.	O
First, let's do an elliptical really.	O
Basic lips for this one so I can start that one on.	O
And we're going to lose the Phil.	O
I'm going to stop to append tool.	O
So here's the question I wanted.	O
I wanted that high and like I do.	O
Let's try this I then.	O
I want this to be symmetrical.	O
So what's going to be easy for sure is to just use the rectangle tool and do the center one, but then the other ones.	O
So I asked like that ones fine.	O
Easy Peasy, now I want this to be just this one so I can hide it.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
This one will be.	CHITCHAT

Traniece Ladson If I pronounce it wrong, please yell at me.	CHITCHAT

Did this one here.	O
I think I like that angle a mess with it if I don't.	O
And I'll just do 'cause we got.	O
These are going to be.	O
I'm going to Pathfinder all of this so it's not going to look ugly and then it's going to look better.	O

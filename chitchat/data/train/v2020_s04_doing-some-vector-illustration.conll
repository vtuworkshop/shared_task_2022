And then I question if I should feel good about myself or something so basic.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I did put it behind.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this one will be behind so will make another shape over here everything is going to hide behind it.	O
Hey murmur odd, how are you?	CHITCHAT
How's everything?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK, so this is good.	CHITCHAT
We're going to reflect this guy.	O
Copy it.	O
Paste it.	O
Right click and go to transform reflect.	O
And we're going to do vertical and click OK.	O
And then I'm going to line it up.	O
Obviously, 'cause We want to be.	O
There we go.	O
And I'm over this way.	O
And we want it touching in the center.	O
So I think that that's a good spot.	O
But now you can see that this is actually off center from the other two.	O
So what will do is will edit that in a second.	O
What's your NATO warning tonight?	CHITCHAT
This yet because everything needs to be centered.	O
There we go.	O
All right, pop this pop this pop this.	O
Unite Mandy all you all you guys know each other, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Or you just being kind, which is totally welcome as well obviously.	CHITCHAT
OK so you can see her out when I United it, it was not like it looks not correct.	CHITCHAT
It looks like a weird thing, so that's why I always rely on control Y or command.	O
Why?	CHITCHAT
If you're on Mac?	CHITCHAT
Because you want it, you want the actual not.	O
They don't want the strokes to confuse you.	O
So I'm doing that.	O
Let's actually.	CHITCHAT
To make this one bit bigger, so I'm going to bring it to where the taxes 'cause That's showing the center of my document.	O
If I can get it there, there we go and then I'm going to do the same here.	O
So now they should be correct.	O
However, once again, if you look now, these are not.	O
The write once I'm going to hit a, I'm going to drag it to.	O
On top of that I would do that.	O
Same with the other one.	O
Now that didn't work.	O
Excuse me, snap to step Snapchat, the path.	CHITCHAT
So there we go.	O
I will go back and go back to our online version.	O
So it should look a little bit better.	O
I'll see if I like it though, and I'm not sure I like how fat it is at the bottom.	O
OK, that looks better I think.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
How's how's it going in this by to cover 19 is going fine.	CHITCHAT
I Luckily solve a job because I you know working in Design Luckily.	CHITCHAT
Is a little bit is a little bit corentin proof.	CHITCHAT
I let me move this really quick.	O
I want to look really quickly at origami paper ship.	O
Sorry, that's my discord.	CHITCHAT
I just want to look, so here's my that's my music if you're interested in what my music is.	CHITCHAT
Chill hop chillhop music on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
Origami Paper ship I mean origami paper, kind of redundant, but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK so.	CHITCHAT
If I look at this little bigger 'cause it's tiny right now.	O
It's got a folded edge down there.	O
I don't think I want to do that.	O
I don't want that amount of details, so we want to show that a little bit, but it does look like.	O
I think I do have too strong of a curve going on.	O
In the bowl itself, but I kind of like the aesthetic of that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hi to Mila.	CHITCHAT
Nice to meet you welcome the stream.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think that.	CHITCHAT
Oh man, so This is why.	O
This is why there's so many different origami you can see like even like this is obviously not the ship that I'm working on.	O
That looks like a legit motor boat.	O
We're looking at this sort of very basic boat.	O
OK, and you sort of have the creases here, I don't.	O
I don't know if I want that either.	O
The other ones have creases.	O
Yeah, they do.	O
And that one is a very faint crease on that one.	O
That one looks like it was created digitally.	O
Yeah, they're just there like creases.	O
It's not like a full in the paper, but it's a guy like the image of this.	O
So what I'm actually going to do is I'm just going to drop it in the list that.	O
That's what happens when you drag from from a a copy image address, not that open in a new tab.	O
There we go.	O
This is what I want.	O

Come on, don't do this to Maine.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we're dropping.	O
Maybe I'm just used to how Macworks my PC's a little more finicky.	O
Alright, I'm just going to keep that there so I don't have to go back and forth to it.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
And that's when you do maximize instead of minimize there we go.	O
Thank you, I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
I need to add more projects to my be hands I.	CHITCHAT
I have unfortunately, as UX designer you have alot of things that are under NDA and.	CHITCHAT
A lot less that you can show.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I do.	CHITCHAT
Let's Come on, I can't command Z 'cause I've got this guy.	O
That's OK.	O
I will come and see 'cause I got my desktop.	O
I just want this back.	O
And because I think.	O
It could be beneficial.	O
Yeah, this is very flat compared to have this, so I'm going to shrink this significantly and then we're going to go back to control Y.	O
So I can see the edges, they seem to be good.	O
I'm gonna go a little little bit.	O
Yeah, so they're not good.	O
This is the power of command.	O
Why everyone slash control why?	CHITCHAT
Again, in case you're in.	O
I'm on PC right now.	O
Little easier for streaming.	O
But I have work on a Mac for work, so I have them both.	O
Oh bye alright.	CHITCHAT
Have a good day.	CHITCHAT
Up So this one actually comes up.	O
It comes up higher than I expected.	O
Maybe, well, OK, so let's restart the I just sort of sketched it how my mind thought of it.	O
And I think it should go a little higher and then we can have a triangle that comes up here.	O
Which would be ideal?	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's what I just said.	CHITCHAT
That's what that's what I'll start with, 'cause I think that feels better.	O
Let's hide this guy right now.	O
Is giving me a headache.	CHITCHAT
Just from seeing all those things.	O
So let's create another triangle and this one is going to be where it comes here in the center.	O
And I will change on the stroke.	O
We're going to change that, so that's inside.	O
So that doesn't do that silly thing, just for now.	O
Nice to meet you too.	CHITCHAT
Up OK, we're going to mess around with this a little bit, but I want to see one more time.	O
We're going to check the CMD why I'm good.	O
And so toggle so you just go back by hitting command.	O
Why again, all right and so then I'll use this as a way to start my.	O
Just move it this way a teensy bit.	O
There we go, and so I'm just going to hit a grab this not that.	O
A grab the.	O
Yeah, it's grabbing it 'cause it's going to command bracket to push up behind.	O
No, that's P.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
To push it behind so I can grab this.	O
There we go.	O
And that should go there.	O
Yeah, so this one doesn't have inside this one.	O
It does have inside so.	O
That's why it looks silly.	O
I'll do that again.	O
I'm going to change these two rounded.	O
So it feels less.	O
Invasive.	O
Of the color.	O
Right now.	CHITCHAT
I do like that.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
But now I have to see what it looks like when I do this, which is what's in Eric, making me nervous, maybe even.	CHITCHAT
More that feels better.	CHITCHAT
Alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
And they're gonna Copyright pace.	O
We're going to reflect.	O
Oh, I did not mean to click copy, but that's OK.	O
I could have done the other one.	O
I think this is the right spot.	O
We're going to go in Oregon, come out the command, why?	CHITCHAT
Again, yet we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, that kind of looks like a thing.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's exciting.	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to use.	O

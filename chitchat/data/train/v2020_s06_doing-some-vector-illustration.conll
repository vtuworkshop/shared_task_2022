This guy and no.	O
No I gotta select these also.	O
No, this one and this one.	O
There we go.	O
We're going to connect.	O
Those were going to remove.	O
By holding all we're going to move these other lines right there so that it flattens out.	O
That feels nice again, cool.	O
A better feel, little bit more nice if we once we fill these.	O
With White And we'll bring this into the back.	O
Open up is not for the reckner drawing, there we go.	O
OK, that's nice.	O
I do think, however, is a little too high.	O
Which I didn't know until I went through all that so.	O
What I'm going to do is we're going to hit A and we're going to grab all of those.	O
I'm going to remove that one.	O
No.	O
I'm not going to do that.	O
We're going to hide.	O
We hide this one until they grab it from the top.	O
Then I'm going to do that.	O
We're going to go we.	O
So that it is.	O
Feels correct.	O
Confirm one more time that were centered.	O
But that's not gonna be the case, because these three need to be.	O
I'll do you control group Groupon?	O
There we go.	O
I was on it.	O
Definitely looked off.	O
Off alignment for a second, we're going to do a control artist in my rulers confirm that their centered.	O
For the same spot, they seem to be, yeah.	O
Oh, that's important too.	O
Maybe I could, maybe I could hit safe.	O
Desktop.	O
OK.	O
Yeah, just just so messed up.	O
And we'll call it paper ship in.	O
I feels good, I think.	CHITCHAT
So it's going to be interesting is when I add these two back in.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Is This guy that guy OK?	CHITCHAT
This one is really quite excuse me.	CHITCHAT
And take another bite of my sandwich.	CHITCHAT
Lunch is important everyone.	CHITCHAT
I kind of want to see what happens if I do this.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
I might like that.	CHITCHAT
I might like that.	CHITCHAT
Because what I want to do I think.	CHITCHAT
Is.	CHITCHAT
Like if I hide let me group that.	O
Show me your face.	O
Under that, do that, oh.	O
See, that's always important to check if you got some extra lines going on 'cause I don't happen.	O
I want to do what I did here which is in Merced a little bit in the water.	O
That's that, boy, which is important.	O
But also we need to do that, so I'm going to go here.	O
Papa, there maybe do it a little bit higher.	O
Yeah, it feels right.	O
We're going around our stroke so that it doesn't have that.	O
Terrifying stroke that was before.	O
And instead of making the Phil White will make it a light Gray.	O
So that it's definitely sitting in the back.	O
I think I'm going to try and keep this to four colors for five colors.	O
Because if I do make this into a pin.	O
It will be.	O
More expensive, the more colors you have so we will reflect this transform reflect when they get a copy of the vertical.	O
And then move it on over.	O
Great, that looks really nice.	O
I think it might be a little close to the edges.	O
Layers this.	O
Reset.	O
It's at the top.	O

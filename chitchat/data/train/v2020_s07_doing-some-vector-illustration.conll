I'm a dork, wow.	CHITCHAT
Alright, and we're going to grab both of these and put the inside here.	O
Behind everything, so let us together and I'm just going to hold alt.	O
And shrink it it, it did did Ted.	O
I'm going to say tad.	CHITCHAT
It happens.	CHITCHAT
Tidbit tad.	CHITCHAT
You know all those things.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's try again.	O
Make sure they're all aligned centered.	O
Yeah, I know people off I can tell.	CHITCHAT
OK.	O
So this one here.	O
It's actually not going to be white.	O
So I think I should.	O
Is it going to be clear?	CHITCHAT
But I don't.	CHITCHAT
Oh jeez, maybe it's not very clear.	O
Maybe it'll be like a light light light blue.	O
Yeah, that would be nice.	O
Let's do like a light light Blue Nile.	O
Do doing the same color as this, but then it's going to be.	O
Super Super Super Super Light.	O
Almost undetectable, yeah, that looks good.	O
And then learning this year here.	O
This create another little.	O
One of these guys paste it in place so it can control shift V.	O
Now we're going to let's make it like a so I can see everything.	O
Let's make it like 30%.	O
Now select this.	O
Or will I or will I?	CHITCHAT
Yeah I will.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm going to copy this off, paste it in place more time.	O
Will Unite it so that its own shape look.	O
It looks like a little Crown.	CHITCHAT
How cute little Crown and then will do.	CHITCHAT
Pathfinder to delete it and delete that.	O
Opening to have the other one.	O
Selected.	O
As well, so I will grab.	O
This will grab that.	O
It will grab this.	O
Needs just to be this little bit here.	O
So there it is.	O
Alright, well we lost that one of course.	O
So let me go back.	O
Add another one of these in place.	O
That's fine.	O
Shape builder one more time.	O
There we go.	O
There's something else.	O
In that little path, that's the correct one, and then this one.	O
There's two of them have created two of them up.	O
Let's delete one.	O
I guess I don't know.	O
And there's that perfect, OK.	O
Now we can delete this guy.	O
Bring this back.	O
I don't think we want to stroke on this one.	O
So I'm gonna hide that.	O
No, I wanted to, uh, that's yeah, OK so.	O
Because I had 'cause I still have stroke on right now.	O
It is including that in the designs, which is not what I intended.	O
But will work with it because it logically that makes sense that illustrator thought that's what I wanted.	O
So just spend it a little bit and I'll explain that a little bit higher here.	O
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Maybe baby.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Not sure.	CHITCHAT
Do you like where it's at?	CHITCHAT
But I think I also want it to be like.	O
60%.	O
Oh, but I think the stroke should be there maybe.	O
Oh, I don't know, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Decisions, decisions, everyone decisions decisions.	CHITCHAT
And so kind of unlike contemplating making that taller.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I could do.	O

Really is just not wait.	O
Wait on that.	O
Make this an actual shape.	O
And then just do another opacity on this one, which is possible.	O
It would still.	O
I think it's still look great.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Do I like that the lack of Opacity on the stroke, though?	O
If I don't, that might be OK.	O
'cause then I can do a copy and paste in place again, but then I'll remove the fill and then make it 100%.	O
Ah, there we go, OK?	CHITCHAT
That feels better.	O
I think, however we did just add another color so that with that it has become a Gray.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Which I How do I feel about that?	CHITCHAT
So right now we've got.	O
One of our stroke color, which is will be metal, so that's not that doesn't count.	O
So the black one count we've got.	O
Gray Oh it, but it will be if I pick like a goal that will have to change.	O
Interesting, think anything cut, this works.	O
But what good is that?	CHITCHAT
Now I can smooth this around and not care.	O
How deep it is OK?	CHITCHAT
I actually kind of like it without the little tiny squares.	O
The top I think will keep it in this spot.	O
We got 3 Blues right now.	O
And two Grays.	O
OK, so we're at five colors and I still need to have the Cork and the Cork is going to be a different color, so.	O
Or maybe it'll be the metal who knows?	O
I'm out of water.	O
So at bubbles.	O
A white does camassa color, so it actually is at six colors right now.	O
Yes, I just simplify somehow.	O
Maybe, maybe we'll, maybe we'll just keep these back triangles as White as well.	O
Let me see how that looks.	CHITCHAT
Not bad, not bad.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and you know what?	CHITCHAT
This is another blue too because.	O
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
Complications.	O
Alright, let's think on it.	O
And then let's now let's work on.	CHITCHAT
Let's work on our lovely.	O
Cork.	O
And I'm going to pull this on top and then.	O
It's opacity, so it's a little bit.	O
I locked it silly girl.	O
Drop a 40.	O
So I'm working.	O
With the right idea here.	O
I don't think I like it that.	O
Pitched let's go like this.	O
OK.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
That you know I'm going to start again with.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I get excited about doing freehand stuff and I don't want to do that.	CHITCHAT
His free hand is where things become inaccurate.	CHITCHAT
And I don't want that.	CHITCHAT
Let's center this on the Artboard.	O
Feel aligned to our board.	O
There we go.	O
OK, so it does actually don't have all of this on the Cardboard centered on their approaches.	O

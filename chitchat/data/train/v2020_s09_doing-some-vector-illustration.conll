Centering it together.	O
There we go.	O
Perfecto Mundo But this going to hide the filter now.	O
We're not there, we go.	O
Let's do.	O
Not that far 123.	O
She.	CHITCHAT
Hey.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
That feels a little better.	CHITCHAT
Still may be a little too pitched, so I'm going to go wanted back over maybe two.	O
Yeah, let's go.	CHITCHAT
It feels a little fat, like wide.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that feels better.	CHITCHAT
I think we would see the top of it.	O
I think we would, so I'm going to copy this.	O
Paste in place.	O
Shrink it in a center.	O
And then shrink it a little bit.	O
Yeah, that feels good.	CHITCHAT
And then this one would go down here, but it would be a little.	O
It's obviously a little bit not as wide.	O
But also it will be a little bit taller.	O
Because.	O
It's further down.	O
That's the curve here.	O
There we go.	O
Go.	O
Do this process down.	O
Check our way again.	O
As I can see, yeah.	CHITCHAT
The pressure I when there's a stroke involved.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Cool, so we're going to do.	O
Merge these two, or is my Unite.	O
And then.	O
We will.	O
Duplicate this lovely.	O
Playing hide it.	O
We're going to use.	O
This guy.	O
Do that.	O
And change the stroke.	O
2 rounded.	O
Then go back and add the layer back end, which is good.	O
So now for some reason it's still doing that, which just means there's strayed.	O
Little guys somewhere there we go found him.	O
Perfect.	O
Now I need to go under all these lines.	O
Oh, not all of them, excuse me.	O
There we go.	O
And this cannot be filled.	O
It needs to be.	O
Transparent.	O
Let's make this color.	O
Oh, geez.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
It's like a quart color like a.	O
OK, great there maybe.	O
And then I'll make it that on the same color, but then will make it a little bit darker.	O
Thanks darker as we want.	O
Alright, also I'm not.	O
Fully looking at this right right line of the other, we go needed to do that.	O
It looks with maybe it should be lighter because.	O
With the darker it looks like it's.	O

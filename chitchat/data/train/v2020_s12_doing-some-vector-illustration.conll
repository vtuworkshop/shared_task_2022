All right, copy this guy.	O
I look silly for a second is hiding on good stuff.	O
And we will do shape builder to Nix those and Nicks that.	O
And then I'm going to.	O
With this on top, it's going to have no Phil but remain.	O
The black stroke.	O
And then we're going to have.	O
This be this.	O
Huzzah.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I think it would be a little bit less than the thickness here.	O
'cause I think the glasses thicker here.	O
So let's make it 40%.	O
Alright, we're creating lots of colors, which is a problem for if this becomes a.	O
This becomes a pin.	O
Fancy sandwich for a fancy streamer?	CHITCHAT
Yes, very fancy.	CHITCHAT
It's made from chickens, chicken that came out of a can so.	CHITCHAT
Super fancy.	CHITCHAT
That's one thing that I know I can eat.	CHITCHAT
If we're running out of food.	CHITCHAT
Checking out of account is not that bad shredded chicken and we can.	CHITCHAT
To a great chicken salad.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we might not want this, but might not want that there.	O
Because of the lovely, even though it looks more realistic.	O
But when I limit our colors right now I have we have white, we have light blue.	O
We have a medium blue.	O
We have darker blue and we have the darkest blue.	O
Let's find Blues already.	O
With White And then I have.	O
Four different Browns.	O
So we have nine.	O
This is a nine color piece right now which is.	O
The expensive very expensive.	O
So the difference here might be not like so minor that I might just keep it.	O
The darker Brown will delete this, maybe?	O
Oh I don't know, let's hide it.	O
Let's hide it because I might want to change my change, my mind afterwards.	O
It just feels so.	O
Different right now, like maybe I also don't want this to be there.	O
Oh well, we want we want the stroke there.	O
Oh that OK, that one doesn't feel as bad.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and it you know I didn't.	O
Even I didn't count the Gray again.	O
The Gray from the.	O
Maybe this.	O
Stroke actually.	O
Is is black and stays that way, so I'll paste it and I'll make this one with no Phil.	O
And I will.	O
Excuse me, hold on.	O
I will make it with a film, but we will.	O
It needs to show.	O
The different pieces, so let's.	O
Delete this guy.	O
Let's delete this guy and delete this guy and then yeah.	O
Now it will have no Phil?	O
OK, that feels better.	O
So we got rid of the Gray, so that's less one less hassle there too.	O
Those are OK.	O
Thanks for the follow, Griselda Garcia.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Another thing, if you like that better, oh thank goodness.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
Oh wait.	CHITCHAT
Why did it go back?	O
did I hit command Z?	O
Oh no, I did this.	O
It needs to be on top of the.	O
The shipping water, that's Why.	O
So what I'll do is I'll just put it in that group because it is part of the ship.	O
Yeah, it looks a lot better with the with the black stroke and what's good is that I now can if I grab this, What is this one?	O
Yeah, that's not OK.	O
I grab this an I grab this I can shift it to wherever I want.	O
I feel like I wanted it to be a little bit.	O
Or dramatic.	O
But then I the problem is, is that I'm getting the top of this water.	O
Someone might shrink this a little bit so that it still hidden behind.	O
Yeah, that feels better.	O
So now we don't have a Teeny Little Square he or treating little triangle here.	O
We don't need the triangle appear 'cause it would have been a little a little too much.	O

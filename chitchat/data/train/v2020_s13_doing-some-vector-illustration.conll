You know what?	CHITCHAT
This makes me want to do the design trend that everyone does.	CHITCHAT
Which is.	CHITCHAT
Where is that list?	CHITCHAT
It's like the colon.	CHITCHAT
You do like.	CHITCHAT
Countries of course, unlike.	CHITCHAT
Trying to show you all and I can't even do it.	CHITCHAT
You do like the worst my pucker affect.	CHITCHAT
Not today, today, today to restore Not I want this one.	CHITCHAT
I give us these little guys.	CHITCHAT
So like one of these little guys.	CHITCHAT
And then there's the little tiny ones, and you do a bunch of room around, oh.	CHITCHAT
Now you gotta keep it the one way 'cause otherwise it's not authentic.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I can do that.	CHITCHAT
That's kinda cute.	CHITCHAT
Not gonna lie.	CHITCHAT
I kind of love that.	CHITCHAT
But obviously a mess.	CHITCHAT
I'm a little bit more, but, uh.	CHITCHAT
I'm such a nerd.	CHITCHAT
For those little things right now, which is kind of funny because I'm like wondering how I can get.	CHITCHAT
I know I want bubbles in here so we're going to make some white bubbles in the water.	O
I want the Cork texture though, and I don't know how I can do that in a hypothetical enamel pin.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Gotta think on it.	O
Or maybe we look at some enamel pins for Funsies.	O
But has a very large bubble.	O
Also, maybe we're going to make will make it actually this color.	O
Oh, shoot.	CHITCHAT
I changed the.	O
Shape of this and then did not.	O
Fix it here, which is a problem.	O
That added cuteness too nice.	O
It is cute, right?	CHITCHAT
It's like you.	CHITCHAT
Not as cute as your your pin up Isabel though.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's do we gotta fix this because I am a nerd and forgot to make it.	O
Even there.	O
So let's pop it here.	O
And we'll add.	O
So I gotta put it down below the water so we go down here.	O
Select both Unite them.	O
That did not help for some reason.	O
Oh, I'm an idiot because this is still there and that is part of the ship in water, so I have to repeat it.	O
F man, I wish I had decided on that that the height before.	O
Let's just randomly of the tick Tock song.	CHITCHAT
Let Tick Tock song.	CHITCHAT
Roxanne.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I have to recreate after we do the shapes for those ones, which is fine.	O
Summer I'm gonna hide those right now because that's the problem.	O
And they're important because it's for our.	O
Our lovely little.	CHITCHAT
Water situation.	O
Sorry, I'm thinking about how to do this.	CHITCHAT
This one is an actual is now a square at the top, which is perfect.	O
So I just need to re.	CHITCHAT
But the copy will pay some place.	O
That's not in place.	O
I mean it is, but it's not in place inside my file.	O
How dare you alright?	CHITCHAT
Shape builder alt subtract perfect.	O
Now we have the correct one.	O
And we're just going to do this.	O
Place it here.	O
This one is.	O
That they do.	O
I have selected it.	O
Oh I can select it.	O
'cause it's.	O
50 is 50%.	O
So that'll be easy to change 'cause I didn't change the hex on it.	O
Will do that will delete that guy.	O
And then we'll we'll do another one on this one.	O
And it's just going to be.	O
Blank with a stroke.	O
No, Phil.	O
And it will be.	O
100%.	O
There we go perfect.	O
Alright, we fix that.	O
Let's go back to our bubbles and then we'll go back to our cuteness that we had.	O
But I definitely think I want it to be this color.	O
Which means we need to make a separate a separate shape for every single bubble so that they have a black stroke line man.	O

Oh Oh no.	O
I like to into the thick lines.	O
Yeah me too usually almost usually.	CHITCHAT
I think it looks a lot better too, which is nice.	CHITCHAT
I think I will definitely shift this up a little bit.	O
Oh not that one though.	O
No, I gotta grab all of 'em Ship ship ship.	O
This is the ship that I'm missing.	O
There we go.	O
Like I want a little bit higher, yeah?	O
Excuse me It would be interesting.	O
What if I was like not purple water?	O
About purple water.	O
What if it was super weird and different?	O
I don't even like purple that much, but I like the I like the idea, I think.	O
Let's do that and see what it does.	O
Oh, do that.	CHITCHAT
Empire Collins Hello I'm good.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
I'm good, I'm good.	CHITCHAT
Oh, what did I just do?	CHITCHAT
Learn Adobe illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Oh I hit F1 accident.	O
Apparently F1 takes you to a screen where you can learn Adobe fun fact, learn illustrator.	O
Excuse me.	O
Let's do it is this one.	O
Copy of the hex code because it's right on top of it and that's.	O
I'm curious about the purple water thing, so we'll see how this goes and then it's at 50% perfect.	O
I kind of like the purple not gonna lie.	O
Not gonna lie.	CHITCHAT
And maybe.	CHITCHAT
Our little night not what I meant to do now what I meant to do?	O
Paste that that's purple now, which we don't want, but we want this to be slightly purple maybe.	O
I kind of like up that plays with the Cork 'cause the Cork is kind of orangey Yellowy Brown.	O
Also, purple known no one expects purple to be water, but I love Blue too.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
How?	CHITCHAT
Bump, Bump, Bump, Bump Bump.	CHITCHAT
Maybe with these ones with the small ones with the thicker lines will do.	O
Obviously we're going to fix these 'cause they look kind of funky right now, but.	O
I'm wondering if we just do the stroke and so like the metal will be the smallest bubbles, which is kind of cool.	O
Do I like it?	CHITCHAT
I like it blue.	O
Let's go back all the way and see.	O

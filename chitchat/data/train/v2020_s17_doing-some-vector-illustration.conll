Six would be the exact, the opposite, like absolute mass Max.	O
I can't talk today.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
This is looking good.	O
I'm getting excited about it.	O
I definitely.	CHITCHAT
I definitely want the little sparkles.	O
I think they're cute.	O
2.	O
Again.	O
Oh Maybe if I did actually let's try the way I did it before again, but then adjusted a little bit.	O
I don't really fiddle with it that much.	O
Rotate 45 degrees so that it's a diamond.	O
Affect is stored pucker.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
dad.	CHITCHAT
And that looks kind of nice.	O
It's a little long.	O
I'm wondering if doing this well.	O
OK, that helps a little bit obviously, but not the stroke.	O
I think this trip is a little wide.	O
So.	O
We try the Plucker and blow it again.	O
Play no effect.	O
OK, so the.	O
It's doing it like.	O
OK, so actually if I go out.	O
It does OK.	O
I think that would happen, but it did.	O
It did work on that.	O
Let's make this on a bit smaller.	O
See if it still works.	O
Yeah, that looks nice.	O
But let's play around with it so that it's.	O
Not so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so like up.	CHITCHAT
Here's where OK.	CHITCHAT
I see what it's doing.	CHITCHAT
Perfect OK.	O
I just jump to conclusions and thought that the other side wasn't going to give you what I wanted.	O
I didn't think that it was going to be.	O
Go.	O
We over here.	O
Maybe a little smaller.	O
I like the sort of asymmetry that it gives it to.	O
So I don't think I don't think I'm liking the dots on the Cork.	O
Very cool, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Aries welcome to the stream or Eris tell me how to pronounce it.	CHITCHAT
If I'm not saying it wrong.	CHITCHAT
Areas or areas?	CHITCHAT
And then let's make it.	O
Some fun colors, maybe?	O
No, we can't do fun colors.	O
I can only do colors have already done.	O
So let's do.	O
Let's do the main color I have.	O
On the in the water.	O
Which is this one right here?	O
We don't do a version of this where it's like I'm not restricted by color.	O
And feel like.	O
Scares me.	O
'cause I would love to make this like yellow, purple and pink or something.	O
But that feels nice.	O
It's a pretty monochromatic design other than the Cork.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Which I don't mind.	CHITCHAT
I do feel, however.	CHITCHAT
But I'm still not like happy, happy with the Cork color.	O
And that feels to anemic.	O
Yeah, I guess it's it's Corky's I can get Corky.	O
Very funny of Maine, right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking maybe I want to see what it looks like with this lighter blue in this spot.	O

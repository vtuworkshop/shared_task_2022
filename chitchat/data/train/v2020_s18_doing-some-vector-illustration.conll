Just because this is where the glass like the bottle would have like that extra lip of glass at the bottom.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know why glassblowers create that, but there's gotta be a reason so.	O
And the bottle which is below.	O
There we go.	O
Like this?	O
100%.	O
And.	O
No pasetti or no Phil, I mean.	O
But also opacity.	O
Grab this.	O
Use our shape Finder one more time, subtract that.	O
And then do that.	O
Not so fun of it.	O
Not that one either, for sure.	O
Should be should be white.	O
Not that one.	O
Alright, I think we're going to keep it.	O
We're going to keep it the light blue.	O
I think I'm OK with that.	O
Uhm Yeah Alright so.	CHITCHAT
Let's do a version.	O
This is why this is when I was restricting my color palette to six colors, I think that's correct.	O
We got the Cork is one colour.	O
We've got one blue, 2 blue, 3 blue for blue.	O
And then we've got white.	O
So Cork for Blues and white that is 6 colors.	O
So let's do a version for the gram.	O
Let's do a version.	O
As as sticky said, for the gram, I have locked objects.	O
Let's see what I have, it's just the my last one is the sketch for OK?	O
Oh, and I have these hidden, which is good because I'm going to use them on this version.	O
Because we did this.	O
We did this for.	O
For a possible enamel pin.	O
So now what I'll do.	O
Is.	O
We have this.	O
Oh, I should've made another layer before I did that.	O
That's fine.	O
What I'll do is I'll just.	O
New layer.	O
Copy everything over normal.	O
That's not true.	O
Yes, it will.	O
Just move it over here.	O
And we'll just keep it there.	O
I'm OK with it being on no art bird right now, well?	CHITCHAT
No, I won't because I actually have to.	CHITCHAT
Let's make it 3 by 3.	O
There we go.	O
Perfect OK.	O
So this one will delete the ones that I have hidden because.	O
They were only there.	O
In the instance that I could make it whatever color I wanted.	O
You can delete my sketch, that's fine, or I'll just.	O
I'll keep it hidden.	O
Actually that's fine and then.	O
These ones are come on.	O
Oh I just got one back that was.	O
This one is still sitting over here for some reason, which is oh.	O
'cause I'm a dork.	CHITCHAT
And it didn't grab the thing that's that's there we go.	O
Roxanne Roxanne all I wanna do is party all night.	CHITCHAT
This one I have stuck in my head.	CHITCHAT
All right, what are we listening to on chill hops over here?	CHITCHAT
Oh wrong one wrong one.	CHITCHAT
All their life nice.	CHITCHAT
Let's actually go back to their thing and I'll select a different one.	O
Alright, enjoy your ad.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Alright, so let's make this like.	O
Purple, like this one yellow.	O
Or something maybe?	CHITCHAT

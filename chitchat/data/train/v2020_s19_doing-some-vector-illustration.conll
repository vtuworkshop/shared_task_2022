And this one PM.	CHITCHAT
Can't even see it, oops.	CHITCHAT
There we go, and then we'll make these to the Gray that I wanted it to be.	O
I have it in the.	O
Not stroke.	O
Right here.	O
So we have a little bit of shadow going on.	O
The rest feel good, I think.	O
It's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not very different.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I think it's not too shabby.	O
Maybe this would be better green.	O
That's nice.	O
Yeah, I mean.	CHITCHAT
For having restrict myself, I guess it makes sense too.	O
To work, I don't know if it's better to work.	O
With that restriction first or without it, but I worked with it 'cause my mind I was thinking enamel pin.	O
Because.	O
After the fact now.	O
I have The only changes are kind of.	O
In my opinion, pretty minor.	O
So in this instance I would have added 123456 more colors, so I went from a 12 color.	O
To A6 color just by these tiny adjustments, which is kind of nice in my opinion.	O
I'm impressed with myself.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I think this is what I would have done with it if I could have done the full color.	O
Excuse me But those are probably big price difference right there in production.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
I feel pretty good buddies.	CHITCHAT
Anyone have any thoughts or?	CHITCHAT
Any critique, any suggestions, any?	CHITCHAT
Anything like that?	CHITCHAT
Loving that begins is doing this now.	CHITCHAT
I've been waiting for that.	CHITCHAT
Which community catch up to Creatives?	CHITCHAT
Maybe this is now our best Ave.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, maybe hey Eduardo, what's going on?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm I'm happy that I be.	CHITCHAT
Hence is is making this happen.	CHITCHAT
Really enjoying what are you trying to change.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I'm trying to change anything.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I just I'm welcoming feedback in case anyone has like a better idea 'cause I kind of just.	CHITCHAT
Like I was talking out loud earlier and I said I had originally had these at one point and then I think it at two point and I was like I don't know and then it sticky and chat was like Oh no thick lines go thick lines and that was helpful for me.	CHITCHAT
I totally agree with his opinion.	CHITCHAT
And I think it works well for it I do is this.	O
No, it's not OK.	O
That's something I didn't do.	O
That make any changes now I didn't seem to make much change, but that's OK.	O
Oh yeah, did oh wow, I didn't even realize I had that.	CHITCHAT
That should have been rounded from the start, so we fix that.	O
We fix that, that's good.	O
Oh, you know what we can do?	CHITCHAT
Actually, let's test out some different metals to see what it will look like.	O
That'll be fun.	CHITCHAT
So let's grab this.	O
Since that's a full color one, it's just yelling at me because I'm I sketch on my first screen.	O
So now we're going to select everything and the stroke.	O
Let's make this stroke.	O
Oman will start with gold shall we, shall we?	CHITCHAT
Alright, where gold is probably like right there maybe.	O
Oh oh OK alright.	CHITCHAT
The problem here is that I'm now put a stroke around the ones that I didn't have shortcut.	O

So we got to grab all of these little guys.	O
And make them completely gold with no stroke, which is totally fine.	O
Now imagine I need to grab the hex code actually.	O
What school does that the black one?	CHITCHAT
What's the purpose of the illustrations?	CHITCHAT
You liked it so far?	CHITCHAT
The purpose I was thinking was making it into an enamel pin.	CHITCHAT
If I have the funding.	CHITCHAT
Weather my own funding or or like maybe a Kickstarter or something, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So I feel like we lose the Cork a little bit with the gold.	O
Uh, we definitely lose.	O
A lot of that Teeny one.	O
So maybe.	O
We should keep these to the same size.	O
Or maybe that make this one a little bit bigger.	O
So that it's a medium sized one.	O
Yeah, that feels better.	O
OK.	O
What schools we can definitely do.	CHITCHAT
There's like and they have like a nickel of black nickel option for black is still an option for the metal.	O
If I wanted to do that, let's trace silver.	O
Oh wait, let's keep it below because that one.	O
Uh will grab all of these.	O
Grab this and will go.	O
Maybe like right there.	O
OK, OK, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't dislike this over, we gotta do the same thing again to this thing.	O
Grab the hex code.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
Fill their remove the stroke.	O
Probably there we go.	O
Excuse, Maine.	CHITCHAT
No, not that there we go.	O
OK, that's pretty face.	O
And then movie The last week and tries copper, which could be really cool too.	O
Copper will definitely more of an orange.	O
Varish that's cool.	O
What type of file do you have to send them?	O
Just the AI file.	O
How do you?	CHITCHAT
How do you control where that they do the lines?	O
Where they do lines that are bubbled, so anywhere that I have a stroke would be where the lines are beveled.	O
It also depends on if I wanted it to be.	O
There's two types of a noun.	O
An animal pins.	O
There is hard and soft enamel, so hard will actually be less.	O
Think it's hard.	O
Yeah, hard enamel has less of a bevel, it's actually it's still metallic, but the like appoxee or whatever it is to make the other colors that are not metal pretty much lines up with it, so it's very flat and then the soft enamel is where it's thicker and has more of a bevel to it like you're talking about.	O
Uh, I believe the file that I have to send them is A is an AI file.	O
I haven't gone into the research that much.	CHITCHAT
I only just decided to do this today.	CHITCHAT
OK, that is a very bright orange.	O
I'm just going to Google copper and see what hex it comes up with.	O
Copper hex code.	O
OK, that works B 87333 into it because that was an aggressive orange that I selected.	O
OK that feels a lot better.	O
That was really funny.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's select these guys again.	O
The little baby ones.	O
Do that and then do that.	O
OK.	O
I I might be feeling the silver or the black.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Grab something, grab these two and move them up here so I can look at him altogether.	O
Roxanne Roxanne Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's what this guy away 'cause he's.	CHITCHAT
He's our 12 color version which we don't want.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Anyone have a preference?	CHITCHAT
Of course it's going to feel different.	CHITCHAT

In illustrator we have the advantage as an advantage.	O
Of course, using layers, so like right here, our life all day you see how it has this shading right.	O
Here is really nice shading.	O
I mean it's kinda.	CHITCHAT
It looks like shading.	O
But it's really a layer that has some shapes, so let me lock all these layers up.	O
No, not that one.	O
No, no yeah that one it is.	O
And so inside of this layer we have these shapes right here.	O
And if you turn it off is gone.	O
Turned it on.	O
There it is.	O
I've already thought of a better way of doing doing this shading so it's going to be gone.	O
It's all going to be gone.	O
Take it out there it is and so my technique is very simple.	O
And and if this answers your question, please let me know and if there are still other parts that you were looking forward to me to talk about and you didn't hear him, please let me know.	CHITCHAT
So get my pin tool.	O
I love the pen tool.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to copy the same angle be similar.	O
Sort of similar.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
It's a matter of fact.	O
What am I doing here?	CHITCHAT
Yes, I'm going to make a copy of that every day.	O
So what I'm gonna do?	CHITCHAT
And let's go ahead and put a color on it.	O
Yeah, it's gotta color.	O
There.	O
For now I'm trying to.	O
I'm going to copy my my angle, that's all I'm doing is copying my angle.	O
Here it is.	O
This angle represents.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
This part.	O
This angle represents the angle that I'm going to use in doing all this shading.	O
Alright, so I have a shape this is shape, right?	O
It's just a shape, there's nothing to it.	O
OK, so here we go shift and our know.	O
Also I can make a copy.	O
And then boom is going to go right there.	O
That's it.	O
So all of my layers are going to be similar to that.	O
So let me click this.	O
Click that and then move this over some.	O
Is getting close, and now let's stick it right.	O
There we go.	O
Boom, that's it.	CHITCHAT
So they said This Is This is the the template I'm going to use for all of my.	O
Shading.	O
Uh-huh Phone like I like it now that I have that I'm going to click and drag across these and go down like that.	O
Yes, that's it.	O
I just established my.	O
Shading.	O
And I actually didn't have to put that on there.	O
But I do need to make one.	O
Anyone there?	CHITCHAT
It is boom that's it.	CHITCHAT
Now I moved that down.	O
Every dance.	CHITCHAT
Got it, the only part that matters is this top part right here.	O
'cause after that this part here.	O
You can go here.	O
I cannot leave my pen tool hanging out.	O
Come on pin tool.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Boom, so now you can see like there's some kind of shadow or 3D effect that is going to start showing up here.	O
And Oh yes, why do I have that here?	CHITCHAT
I need that.	O
There it is.	O
Got it cool.	O
Awesome.	O
There it is and so here it comes.	O
So now I'm slowly going to build out.	O
This.	O
Some of this are.	O
This these layers shapes to give this a shading effect.	O
And you can do this, you know, not that way I'm doing it.	O
There's all kinds of ways of going about what I'm doing right now.	O
I'm just kind of being Super.	O
Careful about all the angle there, so so as I move on across the letters and a half this.	O
The shape right here and look, I can click on that hit my Pathfinder boom there saw one shape.	O
And so now it looks like there's a shadow very simple in this.	O
By you loading up, I don't want it like that loading up.	O
A layer was shapes and then you turn down the opacity of the layer or this is multiply.	O
Here's normal.	O
Here it is.	O
If I turn it down like that, what if I do multiply an turn it down, then look?	O
Now I got a whole another shade and that's one of the ways in which we do shading.	O
Here's another way as I am.	O

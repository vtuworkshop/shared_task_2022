I'm working on the skull.	O
Here's my skull.	O
There's there's a layer for the shadows, you see that.	O
Later for the highlights and a layer for the color of the skull, and so by you layering.	O
Layer shapes, layering shapes, then you give the effect of a shadow.	O
Now there is the next step is really where you know well there's another a couple of these steps.	O
One of the steps that can be get really, really crazy and fun.	CHITCHAT
Is if?	CHITCHAT
You add a gradient, so let's add a gradient to this all 'cause it's not going to have a gradient when I'm really done with it, but I'm going to do it now so you can see it.	O
Then I'm going to get to the project that I came here for, right?	O
So let me lock that up.	O
No, no lock that up and get this one out there we go, boom or not, let's like this one up and get this one.	O
Alright here we go, gradients, gradients are your friends.	O
Get the fill color.	O
And as we look at OK boom, there's a gradient on it right there.	O
And in the shadow is coming from this side going out that way.	O
Look at that off.	O
On That said, 46% I can make it darker.	O
I can make it lighter.	O
I can do whatever I want.	O
Let me see.	O
Here we go.	O
Turn that up a little bit turned me up.	O
There we go, yes now.	O
That's not all.	O
Ha.	CHITCHAT
That's not all there is to that.	O
I can do more.	O
So from there make another layer.	O
Uh-huh I got my pencil here.	O
Watch this.	O
Boom, put a great in on it.	O
And then this whole thing.	O
This whole layer is going to have a multiply.	O
And a boom.	CHITCHAT
I said I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't think this is the right angles.	O
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's pretty close.	O
This side is bad.	O
Uh-huh Is close all right?	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	O
Boom, see that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, next.	O
And as a matter fact is need to keep making copies.	O
There we go.	O
Van Uh-huh There it is.	CHITCHAT
Elsa then needs to be under let's go back.	O
There you go.	O
Look at that.	O
What do you think Elizabeth?	CHITCHAT
What're y'all think about this?	CHITCHAT
See that now is like.	O
Whole whole new dimension.	O
Of illustration is coming into play.	O
Uh-huh There it is.	O
And the reality of what needs to happen there.	O
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
OK, that one is just needs to stay inside it here at the matter fast too.	O
Let's go like this.	O
Uh-huh Uh-huh There it is.	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Ask Anna cool.	CHITCHAT
I like it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what you guys think, but what do you think about that?	CHITCHAT
Elizabeth and anybody else?	CHITCHAT
Gotta comment, suggestion or question please drop it let me hear it.	CHITCHAT
The key is that you use.	O
Paths shapes.	O
To give that illusion of shadow.	O
And it's a combination of all these things that going to give you.	O
An awesome design.	O
Uh-huh That said, I need to figure out I'm gonna cut that out.	O
All that's gotta get cut.	O
OK, this is a copy of that one.	O
So let's go there.	O
Bam.	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
This is hardcore.	CHITCHAT
I like it.	CHITCHAT

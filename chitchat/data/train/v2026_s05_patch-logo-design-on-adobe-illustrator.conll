I like it.	CHITCHAT
I like this letter A part here.	O
Let's go like this.	O
Let's take it rid of that.	O
And then this one needs to go up a little bit.	O
Uh-huh And.	CHITCHAT
Miss you saw that?	CHITCHAT
Like that?	CHITCHAT
Grab this.	O
Uh-huh Hey girl, just add a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Bring it in tighter.	O
There it is.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh Thank you you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome, Elizabeth.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome.	CHITCHAT
There you go in.	O
It's a It's a combination of the gradient tool.	O
And the transparency.	O
Or the gradient window radiant palette and the transparency palette and all of those things work together.	O
what I like to do though is make sure that you set the transparency and blend modes to the actual layer.	O
That way all of these things that you create inside that layer will carry that on.	O
You don't want to have to keep adjusting each and every path that you create in a layer, because then after awhile now that's going to get redundant and tiring, and you'll be like what?	O
Where did I even try to do this?	CHITCHAT
Ah, see now that I added this gradient.	O
Which is not what I intended to do.	O
Now I gotta add it to the skull.	O
Well, you know what I do have a gradient up there.	O
And I have a great inside the skull.	O
Ha ha ha.	CHITCHAT
I may not do this one.	O
This is too much of a gradient right there.	O
This one the gradient has to be at the top, so I think that's 90 there.	O
There it is.	O
Or I can do it in the bottom.	O
And as the negative 90 bam.	O
Yeah, I could do that.	O
I could do that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I want to.	O
'cause?	CHITCHAT
'cause then that just adds extra time.	O
I was not prepared to add extra time.	O
To my design.	O
But I just thought of some more things.	O
As how it goes out, list to the gradient on this.	O
Bang.	CHITCHAT
And this negative nine?	O
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
And then I'm going to put the filter on this one.	O
Multiply Errigo And actually, I'm gonna change that color.	O
Yes.	O
Boom boom boom.	CHITCHAT
This girl here.	CHITCHAT
And try.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Color barn is cool.	O
Our light Uh-huh I'm just playing with the ideas.	O
Of course you.	O
Saturation that doesn't help.	O
Color.	O
Turn down the Opacity.	O
Doesn't help.	O
Yes, go to multiply.	O
And change that color.	O
2.	O
Lure Dark blue Uh-huh And if that's going to be dark.	O
Then the worse.	O
Are going to be white.	O
There it is.	O
Ah, and then it's going to look dramatic with the shading, uh?	O
Mainly Elizabeth Ellis says I mainly traced.	CHITCHAT
It outlines.	CHITCHAT
I mainly Tracy outlines of a different parts of humans, but I wanted to make it more realistic so this definitely helps me out a lot.	O
You welcome that's good.	CHITCHAT
OK I'm glad it does help you out and into my other technique that I'm using with my 6 Fanarts And if you check my profile you see other videos and that post is on my be hands portfolio you'll notice and I must say this outside of.	CHITCHAT
Outside of.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, not in, not in.	CHITCHAT
In the app.	CHITCHAT
For school, for or have a school.	CHITCHAT
Erin is skull service.	CHITCHAT
And I have a whole another drawing shading style and let's pull that up.	O

Yeah, so you know pregnancy to global leader higher education blah blah.	CHITCHAT
I don't like schools.	CHITCHAT
Another school OK cool, so there it is.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, there's all kinds of ways of doing shading and.	CHITCHAT
What was it exactly shading in illustrator?	O
And this is I've been taking.	O
Notes on his work and ever since Adobe draw really came into a full vector drawing app and the Apple pencil helped with the iPad I've been, I've been chasing.	O
The skill level that makes it fun has to level up my work, leveling out, leveling up.	O
So here's my Sycamore there, no, no this out the way.	O
Move this out the way.	O
Is unlock all of these for now?	O
Put it right here, boom, so here's the Scottley Poker.	O
That's one of my gods.	CHITCHAT
So it's got all the layers that I just showed you and then this one.	O
I just finished the other night.	O
It's got all kinds of gradients and shading.	O
And then, uh, the first one I finished was hers.	O
An excuse me, so I need to discuss a kinds of little shading details.	O
It should be a little darker.	O
It's kind of bright.	O
So I play with that some more when I'm done and these guys are next.	O
These guys were here.	O
And this guy right there.	O
So I'm 3 down three more to go.	O
Oh A long ways to go.	O
And uh, and so this one is another one that I'm working on.	O
I started this goal with Adobe illustrator on the iPad, and uhm, I don't know how my file I just sent it to the foul.	O
It crashed, but I was able to recover it here in illustrator so I'm very happy about that.	O
So any case that's a little quick update on how shading works with illustrator and I see some things that I want to do with this piece.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh yeah.	CHITCHAT
This is all kinds of different styles happening here too.	O
It needs to be more consistent in.	O
It's not, so I'm going to have to clean up all of this, make it harder.	O
And then, because this is very sharp, that's kind of sharp and curvy.	O
And this needs more.	O
Sharpness is not sharp enough, and then I'll get to the fence so that'll be another day.	O
I need to finish that later.	CHITCHAT
I got other stuff.	CHITCHAT
I got this other one to do an right now what I need to work on is a logo, so let's get back into where we're here for Desi's my man.	O
Let's see which one is which.	O

I gotta look over here to find that file.	O
And Elizabeth when you get done working on some of your illustrations, make sure you post them on.	CHITCHAT
On behalf.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm going to go look.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Was this here?	CHITCHAT
There's something else I got too many windows open.	CHITCHAT
There they are.	CHITCHAT
So here we go.	O
So that's the EPS that's not the one I want, so this is the one I want to write here.	O
Logo roots.	O
Yeah, that's the one hoping it.	O
For some strange reason, when you're in a look at your files in windows, it doesn't show your preview, but when you look at it in a Mac, it does show you the preview.	O
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now what we're supposed to do, what I'm supposed to do is work on a Patch.	O
And when I created this logo for rusty roots, my man Desi.	O
Check him out, he's in Facebook in Atlanta somewhere in Georgia.	CHITCHAT
I did a very hardcore.	CHITCHAT
Version of the logo, right?	CHITCHAT
Like like Super Deep.	CHITCHAT
This is a lot of different gradients in layers and things happening.	O
And it's cool.	O
When using that logo for like a shirt or a banner.	O
But once you make it smaller, you start losing a lot of the detail.	O
Which is why then I gave him this one was that a little bit less detail, but it still has shading.	O
I think that's what I'm gonna start then.	O
I did us a much cleaner version where I just took away a lot of the details.	O
And then I did another version that is way just broken down, just no cut.	O
Noah highlights, no shading, no shadows, no nothing is just the basic colours, flat colors and so that way he can use it in many different ways.	O
However, now it's time for another Patch and he wants to wear rusty and the word roots top and bottom.	O
So I'm gonna draw that out.	O
Let me see if I can.	CHITCHAT
Make sure there we go.	O
So what happened here?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	O
Just checking to see what happened.	O
Bum bum bum.	CHITCHAT
Kokoko, OK, that's done.	CHITCHAT
Done.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
I was checking to see if Jesse was there around, but he's not, so we're going to start right here and I'm looking at the reference that he gave me.	O
That's what it was, the reference, and he sent a message with.	CHITCHAT
What he wants and how The Who wants to love it to look.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to reference it it when I need it, but right now I don't have to look at it.	O
Somebody else there, it is right there.	CHITCHAT
Boom, OK, so let's do this.	CHITCHAT
So what are you gonna do then?	CHITCHAT
Well first I'm gonna get rid of things that are in the way.	O
Messing with my vision.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
I should I should keep?	CHITCHAT
I will keep this one.	O
I'm going to get rid of that.	O
Get rid of it.	O
Get rid of that.	O
Ann Since I'm here now.	O
That's going to be.	O
Is that my artboards?	O
Select them, get rid of them.	O
Boom As a matter of fact, OK, that's it.	CHITCHAT
So now.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to grab my art board.	O
Hold on, click on this one.	O
Hold on alt key click and drag.	O
Hold down shift so they kind of lineup and that's it.	O
Boom, I got 3 artboards.	O
And so.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna work on this logo up here.	O
And it's going to be based on this logo, while I still have this one in case I want to start with this one and start adding on to it.	O
Which is not a bad idea.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Thinking, thinking, thinking.	CHITCHAT
Let's see let's go like to start taking things out.	O
This circle gotta go.	O
These letters got to go.	O
A school like that.	O

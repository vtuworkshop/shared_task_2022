So now I'm starting to add the letters where they belong.	O
And you'll notice that you can send it to the paragraph so it lines up in the middle and I can move my handles.	O
Bone, so that doesn't go past this point right here.	O
And the other one is over here, so I can make my letters bigger.	O
Here we go.	O

Got the letter Y.	O
And if I was to.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think that's what it was going to happen next, so I can do a thick line like this.	O
Boom Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm after.	O
That's the idea.	O
The execution is really bad right now.	O
But that's the idea.	O
And then let's look at the thickness of these lines.	O
So that's it.	O
Uh-huh That said, OK cool alright take that layer, get rid of it.	O
Yep, delete it.	O
Near layer boom, let's go.	O
Now we move for real.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Uma.	CHITCHAT
Let's go.	CHITCHAT
And the layer is has a opacity.	O
And there you go.	O
So what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
I'm drawing the letter so they look drawn, but I'm using a actual font as a template.	O
The only thing about illustrator.	O
Is that you can't rotate the campus.	O
So whichever direction the letters going, that's the direction you're going to have to draw, and it's not a good drawing situation.	O
That's why I draw an Adobe fresco.	O
He goes complaining already.	O
See that right down there is complaining so already complaining,	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Illustrated in that May for all this drawing.	O
Is the tools are there?	CHITCHAT
But that's not how you use illustrator.	O
Are you going?	CHITCHAT
Hum, hum.	CHITCHAT
There it is, is coming.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can make him closer?	O
And bigger.	O
I'm thinking I'm thinking.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's keep rolling.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm a roll with this for now.	O
Illustrator is complaining all that rendering right there and I got a 16 gigs of ram on this computer.	O
So I should work fine.	O
All right, there we go.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Let me get that over there.	O
Uh-huh There you go.	CHITCHAT

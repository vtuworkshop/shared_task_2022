So now we know what's happening.	CHITCHAT
Get that blah brush.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Take that one off.	O
There you go.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Woo Hoo.	CHITCHAT
Alejandro Meza Looking out do you have any setting on the brush you're using which brush 'cause I got?	CHITCHAT
I've been using a couple brushes.	O
An uh, I do have a setting so number one is the blob rush.	O
And, uh, it responds to pressure.	O
And I have a set to three.	O
I got the three points.	O
I got the pressure on.	O
I got the evaluation at three point.	O
And so that less Maine get that second thing.	O
Whatever I want, right?	CHITCHAT
Then The other brush is my paintbrush.	O
An I made my own brush.	O
So right there.	O
So that way this brush gives me that.	O
I started off as a block.	O
It ends in a point.	O
There it goes.	O
So I got a couple brushes here that I've been using.	O
One gives me that automatic come.	O
A hard clean lines that I can adjust, but when I'm when I'm using this brush right here, I really don't want to draw what I really want to do is do my.	O
Anchor point my pen tool.	O
Then I select the brush and now I have a very clean.	O
Align versus all these anchor points right here that come when I use the brush itself.	O
So few few things, the blob right there you go, good answer.	O
I'm glad you told me.	O
I just answered all of them, but the blood rushes amazing.	O
I love the blah brush.	CHITCHAT
Now you can draw anything and everything with the blob rush.	O
And then.	O
May the blob rush?	O
As me.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Let me get this out anyway.	O
I need the selection tool.	O
Alright, good, now I can select the inside.	O
Of the other shape, delete it boom gone.	O
Select that, delete it.	O
Is a little short cuts that you learn as time goes on among.	O
There goes the leader.	O
Love it back to the blob rush.	O
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm glad I you.	CHITCHAT
Ask the question, Alejandro, so I can show you a few things.	CHITCHAT
This is the blah blah is amazing and this is the same theory behind drawing with fresco an Adobe fresco using the.	O
Vector brushes, because when you bring him into illustrator then that those those that artwork that you created is vector in illustrator.	O
Eraser.	O
Pressure.	O
That's fine.	O
Eraser.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
The other thing in illustrated you can't rotate the screen.	O
I can rotate this, but then camera is gonna look crazy.	O

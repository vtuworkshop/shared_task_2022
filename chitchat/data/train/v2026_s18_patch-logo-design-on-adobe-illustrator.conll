Fresco allows you to draw and vector with vector brushes.	O
Kind of like what I'm doing right now.	O
And was cool about that.	O
Is there fresco you can export a PDF and open illustrator an all your vectors are alive so you can still continue drawing an doing more to the file then was available in Frisco.	O
Fresco is still improving.	O
There's more things happening in Frisco, so eventually you'll all the clouds.	O
You'll be able to do more with wrestling, which you can right now is slowly building now.	O
Illustrator for iPad is coming.	O
I've been playing with it is I love it 'cause it'll response just like illustrator an was coming to illustrator is same thing that's happening with fresco.	O
An photo shop is that you have creative cloud documents and I can say this to the creative cloud in illustrator.	O
Open illustrator on the iPad and keep on working except that there's some things that are not supported in illustrator for iPad just yet.	O
By the time it it goes live I'm sure it's going to be pretty.	O
Khloe and Rob.	CHITCHAT
Pretty robust.	CHITCHAT
And we'll be able to do a lot more now like that.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Just do what you can, what you got, but get very familiar with fresco 'cause I use fresco all the time and if you look at my um.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's nice.	CHITCHAT
How did that work?	CHITCHAT
OK, if you look at my big hands, you'll notice how I've been using fresco for a couple of my projects.	CHITCHAT
Alot of my projects.	CHITCHAT
So fresco is still a go to app right now, but I finished my artwork in illustrator.	O
I always come back to illustrate it to finish the artwork.	O
So there.	CHITCHAT
You gotta do that.	CHITCHAT
And see if this is too much.	CHITCHAT
He may ask me to take some of this off, will see.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so try that.	CHITCHAT
Have fun with it and then check out some of my drawings that I've been doing with fresco.	CHITCHAT
But yes, illustrator for iPad is coming.	O
Oh, I can't wait for it to be ready and uh and really show off.	CHITCHAT
There's a ton of.	O
Functionality this coming to illustrator.	O
I have 40 four.	O
I'm checking I'm checking my transparency in some of this and that's 57.	O
So Why is that?	CHITCHAT
You know what I'm gonna do?	CHITCHAT
So you know, try it out.	O
Have fun with it and see what happens.	O
Central a.	O
That's what we're gonna do.	O
Normal.	O
Boom Then let that transparency be.	O
Here I'm adjusting things, making it better hair.	O
Boom that's what I meant is what I need.	O
Why is that their color?	CHITCHAT
Oh, so they still have that.	O
But yes now.	O
And so I use both.	O
So just to finish talking about what you're asking me is that I use both.	O
I use everything.	O
I use photo shop, illustrator and um on the iPad on the on the.	O
Does a surface on a PC, whatever I get my hands on, I do that I use it.	O
And so just get used to it.	O
Try it out, see how it works for you and have fun.	CHITCHAT
Have fun, enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
It's only going to get better an right now I'm finding out how creative cloud documents are working and uh, and that helps when you want to go from an iPad app to the desktop.	O
It helps to be able to just jump on whichever device you want too and see how your files and work on all your files.	O
And not worry about whether this is an app or is it is full software.	O
There I could go on and on about this all day though as I enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
I think the creative cloud is a great deal.	O
Alright, let me move some of these things out the way.	O
And, uh, that's it.	CHITCHAT
That's it is coming.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
That I'm here.	O
Let me see, Yep.	O
Let's keep working on this.	O
Uh, in here?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's go with them.	O
Blah brush.	O
So now.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	O

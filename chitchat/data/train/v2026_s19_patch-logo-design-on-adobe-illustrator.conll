Is that the same color?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's the same color.	O
As well like that.	O
There you go.	O
Sign to add some elements here.	O
And I'm using the same layer.	O
For all of it.	O
There you go.	O
Please ask more questions so that I can keep on talking.	CHITCHAT
I love drawing in Vector.	O
And whatever I can do.	O
To make it look as clean as any traditional.	O
Illustration that that's what I'm after.	O
There it is.	O
Uh-huh There you go.	CHITCHAT
I like drawing an well.	O
I like illustrator for the vectors right?	O
And then I like I'm gonna check those comments in a second and I like but I like to draw so I like the vector because of the scalability and how clean it looks.	O
You know in the pen tool, but also like being able to draw an have that organic look and feel to it.	O
So that's why I use.	O
Depending on the illustration in the drawing I use a combination of.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
The blob brush or the pen tool.	O
However, when I'm on at all, it's all.	O
Not a blood pressure.	O
This vector brushes anan.	O
It has that organic look and feel.	O
And that's what I like about that.	O
That's what I'm excited about fresco, and before that I was using Adobe draw.	O
So yes, I hope you guys are enjoying the apps like I have.	CHITCHAT
There we go and see the part of the organic looking feels that it looks a little rough.	O
It doesn't have to be perfect, you know.	O
It has a whole different feeling to the artwork and that's what I like.	CHITCHAT
I want to be able to draw things that have that feel to it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let me check the comments.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Uh, AT handle says understood good good good.	CHITCHAT
Marissa says I'm starting to try this area illustration do you have?	CHITCHAT
Ditch for beginners so you have ditch for beginners.	CHITCHAT
Explain that Marissa I don't know what that means.	CHITCHAT
Maybe there's a typo in you actually wrote a different word, and then it came out looking like ditch.	CHITCHAT
But My advice?	CHITCHAT
For beginners is 2 number one explore the application whether you're an illustrator on a computer or illustrator.	O
Well, one day or Adobe fresco on an iPad.	O
Explore the app, get familiar with what is on the was available, what is it about?	O
How does it work and then that way you're able to.	O
Create more.	O
And get creative nor where the tools are.	O
So Explorer, be creative, try things out.	CHITCHAT
See how they workout.	CHITCHAT
Weather is the right thing or the wrong thing is though that's not what I meant to do exactly.	CHITCHAT
Were you know?	CHITCHAT
Just try it out.	CHITCHAT
You know what we're going to do here?	CHITCHAT
As let's see, Yep, this right here.	O
So just try it out.	CHITCHAT
As you trying things out.	CHITCHAT
This got tricolor for now.	O
Then practice your skills you know, figure out what is it kind of art?	CHITCHAT
Do you like?	CHITCHAT
What is it that you want to create?	CHITCHAT
How was the art style that you're after?	CHITCHAT
what I did right now is knowing these tricks help out a lot.	CHITCHAT
I just copied that layer that has these letters.	O
And then I change the color.	O
And I'm going to start doing this.	O
However, that's not going to work on that one.	O
As put that back here, you have to know your little tricks.	O
There you go.	O
Turn that and then go like this.	O
Pathfinder.	O
Boom, see I got though I'm using the letters they have already withdrawn and then re using the same letters into turning into the color and then and then still bring him back to the.	O
Outline of the letters so I don't have to redraw the actual letters.	O

So check him out.	CHITCHAT
Hey man eyes asking another question, can I tell you something about graphic design?	CHITCHAT
Ask me a specific question, I'll tell you about it.	CHITCHAT
And while I wait for you to give me actual question, I'll tell you a couple of things.	CHITCHAT
Number one.	CHITCHAT
Figure out what kind of design you like.	CHITCHAT
Is it uhm?	CHITCHAT
And it has to do like the type a branding or clientele.	CHITCHAT
Right, do you want to do design?	CHITCHAT
For a dozen top.	CHITCHAT
Something is that with these letters.	CHITCHAT
You want to do design for hospitals.	CHITCHAT
You know you got to think about who you are.	CHITCHAT
There it is right there?	CHITCHAT
Say who do you want to do?	CHITCHAT
Design work for?	CHITCHAT
Type of company type of.	CHITCHAT
Organizations you know understand who you want to have, who you want your client to be, because opportunity is going to come your way.	CHITCHAT
People with money may come your way.	CHITCHAT
People with that money is going to come your way.	CHITCHAT
And, uh, and you had to be ready to choose the different kinds of designs that are out there.	CHITCHAT
The design work that you do for Coca-Cola is different than what you do for the hospital.	CHITCHAT
You know loop, so the design work that you do for.	CHITCHAT
Like a government agency.	CHITCHAT
Is different than what you do for a construction company.	CHITCHAT
Then what you do for real estate company?	CHITCHAT
So understanding the place of Design in each of those.	CHITCHAT
Industries will give you the chance to figure out well.	CHITCHAT
do I want to try it?	CHITCHAT
They wanna draw or design for buildings all day everyday.	CHITCHAT
Do I want to do something fun for like Netflix?	CHITCHAT
You know all of those things and even working for Netflix, they'll be different departments.	CHITCHAT
There could be a department for social media department for.	CHITCHAT
Marketing too.	CHITCHAT
Marketing materials for the public marketing materials for, uh.	CHITCHAT
Enter into Department design.	CHITCHAT
So think about design in terms of what are the jobs out there an what would I do with that?	CHITCHAT
This side with that and once you establish that, then your portfolio needs to reflect that.	CHITCHAT
And so if you want to, let's say work for Coca Cola.	CHITCHAT
What is I don't think Coca-Cola designs in your portfolio.	CHITCHAT
They don't cost you anything is if you're in school or if you're trying to just build your portfolio, then you do that.	CHITCHAT
And then share some of that design work that you're doing.	CHITCHAT
Share it.	CHITCHAT
Some of that share some of that in your.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Share it on social media.	CHITCHAT
So then when people see it.	CHITCHAT
The companies can see it.	CHITCHAT
You tag them.	CHITCHAT
The companies will see it and be loud.	CHITCHAT
Why does this person not have a job with us?	CHITCHAT
This give this person a job.	CHITCHAT
And then that's how that takes off.	CHITCHAT
But you have to understand what kind of design you're going to work with or you want to work with.	CHITCHAT
Not all designers are the same.	CHITCHAT
Not all designers have the same style.	CHITCHAT
Some designers like to solve problems and to design.	CHITCHAT
Create the French design that doesn't exist anywhere, and then there's some designers would like to see a template and say you know well, let me just adjust that and then that's what I'm going to use to work on this project.	CHITCHAT
And I know both kind of designers on the kind of designer the lights to work on with problems with problems.	CHITCHAT
And then say, OK, well how can I adjust this?	CHITCHAT
How can I take take this message?	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Make sure is the design reflects the message.	CHITCHAT
And once I get that problem, solvers like cool now I don't want to do the rest of the designs like I want to.	CHITCHAT
I want to come up with the branding design.	CHITCHAT
And then let somebody else.	CHITCHAT
Design all the other assets that are required, not me.	CHITCHAT
'cause then to me that's boring.	CHITCHAT
So that's a little bit on that.	CHITCHAT
If you have other any specific questions and please ask it an I will get on it.	CHITCHAT

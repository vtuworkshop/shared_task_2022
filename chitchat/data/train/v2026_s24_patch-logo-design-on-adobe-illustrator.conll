Or any I can read?	CHITCHAT
I can read words that have the alphabet that I'm used to, but let's get back to the question.	CHITCHAT
The language it is going to depend.	CHITCHAT
On the R style.	CHITCHAT
That you're after.	CHITCHAT
Like this, we wanted to be very bold.	CHITCHAT
Very young.	CHITCHAT
AMA here we go.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
Very yeah.	CHITCHAT
Curtis.	CHITCHAT
We kind of wanted to.	O
Have a fun, dirty grimy, dirty style.	O
So that's why it has a lot of bold lines, however.	O
You're lying weights in this inside area are going to be different than the outside area.	O
Why is this?	CHITCHAT
This has, uh?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there you go.	CHITCHAT
And so you had to pay attention to the line weights.	O
And the inside of a shape.	O
Or a object?	O
Because I'm outside, lines are the ones are gonna be more dramatic and bold to bring in the whole thing into focus.	O
And so like here this line.	O
It's a different in weight than the lines that on the outside.	O
And you have to think about that as your drawing something.	O
Because you want to be able to.	O
Make things fit now just because that's that works for one R style doesn't mean that that's what we do with all other ourselves.	O
Some are cells are going to be different in others, you're going to need a different.	O
Line weights.	O
Some drawings have the same line.	O
Wait all the way through.	O
It all depends on the R style too.	O
Alright, I think that's this one, yeah?	CHITCHAT
Where is this?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I need that.	O
OK.	O
So so you know, it's really depends on what you're doing.	CHITCHAT
And you need to have examples of what you're working on sometimes.	CHITCHAT
I will research.	CHITCHAT
Other artists work.	CHITCHAT
And try to figure out how they did something.	CHITCHAT
Like how did you do that?	CHITCHAT
And then I'll and then I spend time.	CHITCHAT
Testing and trying.	CHITCHAT
And making it work for me.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Right now I don't want to redraw this line, I can just do that, boom.	O
Ann Let's erase the part that I don't need.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
All right now I need to find other.	O
Let's see like all these are.	O
I'm looking for.	O
This line.	O
Uh-huh What about that one?	CHITCHAT
There you go?	CHITCHAT
These two.	O
Are you gonna delete that?	O
At least that.	O
There it goes.	O
It goes that one.	O
Uh-huh And that's done OK, so I work here.	O
Thank you you're welcome, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
I need to see this.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, ask questions, I'll answer them, but I'm still working on this piece.	CHITCHAT
Right now what I'm going to do is use.	CHITCHAT
I'll use my blood rush to see what happens.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
There you go.	O
Uh-huh There you go.	CHITCHAT
There it is.	O
Yeah, it looks weird.	O
Not right, fix it.	O
Uh-huh I need to fix that line.	O
I do less pressure here.	O
Less pressure there and there it is I don't like it.	O
Fix it.	O
So if we draw a line.	O
Uh-huh do it again.	O
Boom There you go.	CHITCHAT

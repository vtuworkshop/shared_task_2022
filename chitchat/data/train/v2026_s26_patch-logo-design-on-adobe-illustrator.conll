We earlier we were talking about like working for Coca-Cola.	CHITCHAT
Well, if you work for Coca-Cola Equator will work.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, Christopher.	CHITCHAT
If you work, if you want a job with Coca-Cola, then you had to study the way Coca-Cola does their projects in their marketing.	CHITCHAT
What the images look like.	CHITCHAT
What the drawings look like.	CHITCHAT
And then produce that type of level equality.	CHITCHAT
Got it, you got to get.	CHITCHAT
To that level, for them to pay attention to him below, we need that we need that person.	CHITCHAT
We need that artist who is that artist.	CHITCHAT
What are they doing right now?	CHITCHAT
Somebody find me a bag of money to get to this artist like yeah, that's me.	CHITCHAT
That's what I want.	CHITCHAT
So you work gotta be banging your work has to look like listen I'll work with y'all but you're going to have to pay me good money.	CHITCHAT
You want customers coming to you.	CHITCHAT
You don't want to chase customers down because then.	CHITCHAT
They'll pay you what they feel is right for you.	CHITCHAT
And since you're over here asking to contribute and show improve well, then they can just pay you enough to show for you to show improve.	CHITCHAT
I want to look at what I'm doing here.	CHITCHAT
That's not a color we want, but I need to see the those clouds.	CHITCHAT
I need to fix us.	CHITCHAT
There it is.	CHITCHAT
You know you gotta pay attention to all the details and all the things that you're doing.	CHITCHAT
And then build a most banging portfolio.	CHITCHAT
One thing that I I heard Cristo.	CHITCHAT
Say they feel you need to know who Chris though is.	CHITCHAT
Look him up on Instagram Twitter.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
One thing that Chris though says is.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's go undo.	CHITCHAT
Is if you're doing homework.	CHITCHAT
And you're given an assignment.	CHITCHAT
You need to do.	CHITCHAT
You need to and the assignment is 3 logo designs.	CHITCHAT
You need to come back with five.	CHITCHAT
If the assignment is a marketing a flyer in the start working on the campaign, you need to start working on things.	CHITCHAT
They're going to help show the true level of your work.	CHITCHAT
And the only the only way you're going to get better at it.	CHITCHAT
Is by doing more more an more you don't have to do more than others, even though that's what I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
But you're going to have to do more than was asked of you.	CHITCHAT
You gotta get a ton of bad artwork out of you.	CHITCHAT
Everything you create is not going to be perfect is not going to be great.	CHITCHAT
I've only really focused on my career seriously.	CHITCHAT
The last 10 years.	CHITCHAT
And even though I've been a professional for 20 years.	CHITCHAT
And what happens is that.	CHITCHAT
I draw and I find clients an at work, but then I got tired of having to.	CHITCHAT
Convince people or clients of what my work is worth.	CHITCHAT
I'm tired of that.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to convince anybody or what I'm really worth.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to see it.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to feel it and be like you know what?	CHITCHAT
Then let's give you a ton of cash.	CHITCHAT
That's the business.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about this example earlier today.	CHITCHAT
Is that?	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I was watching, but it got me thinking.	CHITCHAT
Is like people on the bench.	CHITCHAT
In sports, if you're on the bench.	CHITCHAT
You always saying put me in coach let me show you let me prove to you something.	CHITCHAT
That's that's that's what people on the bench say.	CHITCHAT
But the superstar he already on the court an that superstar is being is being given.	CHITCHAT
Oh the.	CHITCHAT
Ah, the UM hoops.	CHITCHAT
All the chances that are that, uhm?	CHITCHAT
That player needs.	CHITCHAT
Whatever that player wants that player guests.	CHITCHAT
But the ones in the bench I like put me in coach.	CHITCHAT
So you got to be that kind of player or artists who is already under court.	CHITCHAT
How do you get on the court?	CHITCHAT
By cranking out amazing artwork being like that basketball player who staying up all night shooting threes.	CHITCHAT
Free throws.	CHITCHAT
Dribbling.	CHITCHAT
And that's why artists need to do constantly constantly crank out work, get better, get better, get better, understanding the software, understand what you're doing, understand the tools, understand, know your computers, know your art materials, know what it takes for you to be great.	CHITCHAT

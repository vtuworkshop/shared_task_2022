I used to have a problem with seeing artists whose.	CHITCHAT
Skill level was not good.	CHITCHAT
Making it big time.	CHITCHAT

I can draw better than that.	CHITCHAT
There's a customer for everybody out there.	CHITCHAT
There's always someone out there willing to pay.	CHITCHAT
For your artwork.	CHITCHAT
So get your artwork out there.	CHITCHAT
But if you want to track, you don't want more clients, you want higher paying clients.	CHITCHAT
And if you want to attract higher paying clients.	CHITCHAT
Then you need to put out some hardcore banging artwork.	CHITCHAT

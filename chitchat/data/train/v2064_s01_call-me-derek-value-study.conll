I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully finish it.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Today we're going to finish it.	CHITCHAT
It's going to get finished today.	CHITCHAT
'cause we're going to move on something.	CHITCHAT
Not entirely different, but probably different.	CHITCHAT
Next week.	CHITCHAT
To be honest, I have no idea when I'm going to be doing next week.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, probably I really enjoy these kind of studies, the.	CHITCHAT
Value studies specially based on.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Busts and statues.	CHITCHAT
'cause typically they are well lit.	CHITCHAT
And the lighting is is.	CHITCHAT
A big thing when it comes to.	CHITCHAT
Having having your studies turn out well, that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
If the lighting of the statue or whatever your references is poor, you're not going to be able to.	CHITCHAT
Gain potential information.	CHITCHAT
Potential information.	CHITCHAT
I know what, how would you say that it just?	CHITCHAT
It really depends on the lighting.	CHITCHAT
How well lit.	CHITCHAT
And what is it?	CHITCHAT
James James Gurney?	CHITCHAT
It talks about this is actually a photo from I think his book.	CHITCHAT
The Abe Lincoln	CHITCHAT
'cause he goes over the different types of typical lighting setups that you'll see.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And like cinema and film and.	CHITCHAT
Anything really?	CHITCHAT
Photography properly like your.	CHITCHAT
Here's subject.	CHITCHAT
So it shows the most form.	CHITCHAT
I would assume that's what it is.	CHITCHAT
It's just to show.	CHITCHAT
It.	CHITCHAT
Shape and form and.	CHITCHAT
Not just be washed out anyways.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Do I have anything else to really say?	CHITCHAT
I don't think I really do.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to turn turn this down a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
For you guys, that's probably too quiet day.	CHITCHAT
You guys let me know if anything is too loud.	CHITCHAT
We're still.	CHITCHAT
There's going to be a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Ironing out Uh.	CHITCHAT
Dustin off.	CHITCHAT
Getting getting things to a.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Passable.	CHITCHAT
Quality level of quality for the streams.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I think this is good at the bars.	CHITCHAT
The bar thing is an OBS local kata, me know if any of you guys.	CHITCHAT
Stream also, but that's.	CHITCHAT
It's one thing to judge by sound bars are looking I'm in this corner too.	CHITCHAT
I think this is my OG corner.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you guys remember.	CHITCHAT
Can I stream?	CHITCHAT
Much more frequently.	CHITCHAT
And then I do.	CHITCHAT
Currently I think this was the side of the screen that I was on and then I would be looking in.	CHITCHAT
To the image right to the video.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, whatever, let's jump into it, man.	CHITCHAT
Do it, hope you guys are having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Evening, afternoon.	CHITCHAT
Friday Mean.	CHITCHAT
It's going to say I'm looking forward to the weekend, but.	CHITCHAT
It's just kind of like another day.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
That sounds really sad.	CHITCHAT
One of it I didn't mean for it to sound really sad.	CHITCHAT
I'm enjoy.	CHITCHAT
I don't work during the weekends.	CHITCHAT
I think that's something that I've done.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't know since I've pretty much started.	CHITCHAT
Freelancing is just.	CHITCHAT
As long as the schedule allows it right, I don't work on the weekends.	CHITCHAT
Time.	CHITCHAT
I guess you really are in charge of your own schedule, so it's it's kind of it's kind of up to you whether you want.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
To work more hours during the week, days right?	CHITCHAT
But thankfully I'm able to take the weekends off.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot more that I can go and do with that, but I think I think we'll just.	CHITCHAT
Will stick with the studies for now.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, maybe maybe I will.	CHITCHAT
Rant on about.	CHITCHAT
Scheduling obtaining work.	CHITCHAT
I think the most difficult thing as a freelancer.	CHITCHAT
I guess I'm going into this now as a freelancer is establishing a client base right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
That's probably the most difficult thing is just getting that rolling.	CHITCHAT
And once that.	CHITCHAT

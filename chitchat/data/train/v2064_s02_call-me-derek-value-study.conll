Kind of.	CHITCHAT
You found concurrent work.	CHITCHAT
Setting up your schedule on how often you want to work so you can pay the bills.	CHITCHAT
It's such a you're constantly balancing.	CHITCHAT
So you're spinning plates and you're putting new.	CHITCHAT
Plates in the Iron.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to melt a bunch of metaphors.	CHITCHAT
You know always having more irons in the fire.	CHITCHAT
You know, planting seeds.	CHITCHAT
Weather, weather, other metaphors can be used.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
That's all we'll we'll use for now.	CHITCHAT
There's always something else.	CHITCHAT
That's going.	CHITCHAT
At least in my world I gotta turn it down a little bit more mind.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's better.	CHITCHAT
I want to be yelling at you guys.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to be shouting.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I'm shouting.	CHITCHAT
And you guys didn't ask for that.	CHITCHAT
I mean, even if you did I don't think I'd feel comfortable.	CHITCHAT
Showing you guys alright so.	CHITCHAT
Hey buddy, can you shut up and draw?	CHITCHAT
I will.	CHITCHAT
I'll so the next.	CHITCHAT
This is just all on its own layer.	O
You know we have the reference in the background.	O
We got the reference right here.	O
We got our line drawing.	O
On this layer, the next step that I would typically do is.	O
I think we can go ahead and.	O
Make an opaque layer, kind of like masking layer.	O
Of just the just the bust so.	O
What I'm going to do in Photoshop Here is.	O
You guys see where my mouse is right here on the far left.	O
Right and I showed this before.	O
This is if you just leave your mouse.	O
Over it, it'll it'll give you the.	O
You know the info on what it is edit and quick mask mode.	O
That doesn't really tell me a whole lot if I'm if I'm being honest and I don't really know what quick mask mode is, but thankfully I can.	O
I can share that with you, I guess, and show you what it is.	O
So I'm going to go ahead and click it.	O
Right so now we've activated that mode right.	O
So if we if we click it again, we go back to standard mode.	O
And what this will do is you notice your layer over here.	O
It's turned pink.	O
And your paint.	O
His turn pink as well.	O
So basically everything that you paint while you're in this mode.	O
Even the cool thing is you can even.	O
Paint with different opacities, right?	O
Different levels of transparency and it will.	O
Also it will consider that it will take that into effect for when you leave this mode.	O
So we go back over and we click it again.	O
It might not look that like where that selection is.	O
It might not look where we painted is also a selection, but it is.	O
So it makes sense.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
It's it's a transparent selection.	O
It still right here as well.	O
But what it does?	CHITCHAT
This is really confusing.	CHITCHAT
I'm already really confused.	CHITCHAT
But we'll go.	CHITCHAT
We'll pretend we're following along.	CHITCHAT
What it does is it selects everything besides what you painted.	O
So it makes sense.	CHITCHAT
So all the all the pink.	O
All the things that you just put down, it's not selecting that right.	O
It's like being the opposite of that.	O
Any issues?	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Girlfriend just picked up some.	CHITCHAT
Dog food for OB.	CHITCHAT
Gotta eat.	CHITCHAT
So let's try that again.	O
Let's do that again here.	O
So we activate the mode.	O
An I'm basically just going to be.	O
Painting and everywhere.	O
You know it probably make a lot more sense if I just use like an opaque brush, but.	O
I'm going to stick to this for now.	O
Right, so it's pretty, you know.	CHITCHAT
So there's so many different ways that you can.	O
Make your masking layer or your I guess your.	O
I don't even know where your base layer, the layer that you cut out.	O
That's opaque that solid.	O
This is one of the ways that I like to do it.	CHITCHAT
'cause I find out my hand I have.	CHITCHAT
I have a tremor so I'm constantly just.	CHITCHAT
My hand is.	CHITCHAT
Disobeying.	CHITCHAT
100% of the time.	CHITCHAT
I guess, and obviously not 100% of the time, but it's very difficult to to use like a lasso tool and be really precise with that.	CHITCHAT

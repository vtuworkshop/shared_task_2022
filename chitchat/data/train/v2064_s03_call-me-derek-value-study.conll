I find that this gives me a lot more control.	CHITCHAT
When I'm trying to make like a selection also, you will still find myself using the lasso tool all the time, right?	O
For like free transform selections and stuff like that.	O
But for when it comes to.	O
You know cleaning up your lines and turning them into opaque.	O
Layers.	O
For.	O
Getting ready for painting.	O
I'll usually go with this.	O
See like 90% of the time.	O
Cool, OK, so I think that's probably get that.	CHITCHAT
Let's do that alright, so that's that.	O
I'm going to turn off the mode now.	O
Right, and so it's got.	O
You can see it's got the marching ants here.	O
It's also got the marching ants.	O
Going all around the canvas right?	O
So that tells you what's being selected.	O
Basically everything but the line works being selected.	O
In this particular case, that's what we want, so I'm going to turn off the line layer.	O
Right, I'm going to turn this off and I'm going to hit control alt shift E.	O
Just kidding, I have to make a layer first control alt shift E have to make a layer for there to be allowed to merge everything on, which is what shortcut command is.	O
And then I'm going to hit.	O
Delete.	O
So all that will be left is that area that we painted in with that pink color right?	O
That makes sense.	O
You guys let me know if there's ever a question.	CHITCHAT
Especially regarding regarding what we're doing, we're actually doing.	CHITCHAT
On the screen.	CHITCHAT
You can stop me at anytime.	CHITCHAT
Are you alright?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Girlfriends.	CHITCHAT
Lifting heavy things, I'm assuming.	CHITCHAT
I'm just saying if there's ever if you guys ever have a question about whatever I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Like I said specifically about what you're seeing on the screen, ask away man.	CHITCHAT
I have no issues going over that.	CHITCHAT
To clarify things alright, so we have that on its own layer.	O
Get the line there.	O
You can even see it's masking arlyne layer.	O
We bring it up, you can see it now.	O
What I'm going to do is actually going to duplicate that so we have just the line layer in the back so we can put that onto.	O
That layer we just made.	O
And in fact, I think I'll just until a little bit so hit control you.	O
Tinted a little bit.	O
So it kind of stands out right?	O
We have that selection.	O
So that's what we painted.	O
Another thing to do is I usually duplicate this a couple of times.	O
Just in case.	O
So my brush strokes when I was selecting that in the mask mode here.	O
Just in case they weren't fully opaque.	O
You know, if there's a little bit of transparency like I mentioned, when you're in that mode and your painting.	O
You accidentally paint something transparently.	O
It will remain that way, and when you turn off the mode, so duplicating your layer and merging them together pretty much takes care of anything that's not opaque.	O
Now I'm going to hold down alt in between.	O
These two layers so it clips on like that.	O
If you notice, you guys are probably already all from familiar with this stuff.	O
You know, if you can see.	O
Along the edges.	O
When you clip it on like this, it stops anything that's on this layer from appearing.	O
Outside of what we have painted on this base layer, right?	O
Very helpful, kind of.	O
Beginner stuff.	O
But once you once you know it's pretty much.	O
Part of your setup, at least it was for me.	O
I can't say this is exactly how everybody paints.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's definitely not right.	CHITCHAT
We're all.	CHITCHAT
Unique snowflakes, right?	CHITCHAT
Actually that has a different meaning nowadays, right?	CHITCHAT
Well, unique.	CHITCHAT
Frozen water falling from the Sky.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Saved or good now.	O
All right, so next I think we're pretty much ready for adding to jump into painting.	O
Selecting my brush.	O
I like this one and I have my brush set available in the info.	O
I think you features.	O
Click it right.	O
Let me just.	O
Yeah, if you click the info button.	O
At the top.	O
It should be what it should be.	O

Like up there on your screen, if you're if you're watching from browser.	O
If you click that you can download the brushes as well.	O
So what I want to do?	CHITCHAT
You know, we could use this.	O
I don't know if I want to use this just yet, it has.	O
There's some nice texture to it.	O
It's like traditional kind of it looks like.	O
It doesn't.	O
It looks like a brush like an actual hair brush, but also not her hair brush.	O
But what do you?	CHITCHAT
What do you call it?	CHITCHAT
It's got hairs on insta.	CHITCHAT
Brush painting brush.	CHITCHAT
Ann But I don't think I really want that texture starting out just yet.	O
So I think I'm just going to stick with the digital round brush for now.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Observe the darker values so typically.	O
But what I'm comfortable with and it doesn't have to be what you're comfortable with, is starting with the darker values 1st, and then building up.	O
From there.	O
Same mentality of starting with larger shapes.	O
You know, get the broad strokes down 1st and then refine from there.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So let's do that.	O
So obviously this kind of.	O
Area.	O
Go back in with eraser.	O
Not too worried about overlapping.	O
Of my brush strokes just yet.	O
You know, I guess I could probably still paint underneath the lines.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
For now and then, once I've finished with this phase this stage.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
That's probably when I can switch to a layer above the lines.	O
I'm going to make this a little bit later.	O
Anything like that for now.	O
You know we can kind of technically technically say this is just like a paint by number.	O
You know we're just kind of filling in the areas that we have.	O
Already created for cells.	O
Defined by our line drawing.	O
I'm also using a smudge tool.	O
To break the edges of my, blend the edges of mine.	O
Round paint brush.	O
Brush strokes rather.	O
I'm going to say all kinds of wrong things on painting as well, streaming, hanging out.	CHITCHAT
I watched through.	CHITCHAT
The vad to get a sense of the sound and I fix the there's no more black bars on the sides of the.	CHITCHAT
Screen here, so I fix the resolution.	CHITCHAT
Should be good.	CHITCHAT
You guys should be seeing.	CHITCHAT
What I'm seeing on my screen right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Was I saying and?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I'm just going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm just.	CHITCHAT
Just blathering on.	CHITCHAT
Just whatever comes in my mind is.	CHITCHAT
Not, that's not entirely true.	CHITCHAT
Definitely not.	CHITCHAT
And I'll hold back on some of the.	CHITCHAT
Stuff that I would normally just.	CHITCHAT
Spurt out butter.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, we don't.	CHITCHAT
Well, I do plan on.	CHITCHAT
I'll say I do plan on returning to twitch at some point.	CHITCHAT
I look forward to the day right now scheduling with a lot of the work that I have.	CHITCHAT
Currently scheduled, it just doesn't allow it.	CHITCHAT
And also, like I definitely could absolutely could, but the type of Derek that you would get it would be just one who's completely brain dead.	CHITCHAT
You know, I think.	CHITCHAT
I really want to make sure.	CHITCHAT
And I think I've been doing a good job is.	CHITCHAT
I had a tendency to, I think a lot of us can.	CHITCHAT
Relate to this is.	CHITCHAT
We tend to bite off more than we can chew.	CHITCHAT
In respect of.	CHITCHAT
Our time.	CHITCHAT
You know, not giving us.	CHITCHAT
Time away.	CHITCHAT
From our work and just always having hey.	CHITCHAT
Kitties I'm at work.	CHITCHAT
Discipline his cats totally understand what that is.	CHITCHAT
Was I saying anyways?	CHITCHAT
Well, what was I saying?	CHITCHAT
I was going somewhere?	CHITCHAT
This is what happens when you get old.	CHITCHAT

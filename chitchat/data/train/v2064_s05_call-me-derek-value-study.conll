First of all, you start rambling about nonsense.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't really matter.	CHITCHAT
Which is why I probably forgot what I was talking about.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hold on, I'm going to want to retrace my steps.	CHITCHAT
I was getting summers.	CHITCHAT
And if I can't, then.	CHITCHAT
I can't.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, uh, appropriate amount of time to work scheduling all that stuff really important.	CHITCHAT
I think a lot of us have a difficult a difficulty with it.	CHITCHAT
I think especially early on.	CHITCHAT
Especially early on 'cause for me at least I I struggle with it earlier on.	CHITCHAT
'cause I was just taking any work that I could.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
And also as a little bit more passionate.	CHITCHAT
Which kind of like I feel ashamed to even admit, like I was much more passionate and driven.	CHITCHAT
I guess that's the word right.	CHITCHAT
You're when you're starting off in your journey.	CHITCHAT
You know the first couple of years, you're just really passionate.	CHITCHAT
And then I don't know if this is the same for everybody else, but this is this is my.	CHITCHAT
Experience with.	CHITCHAT
You know starting freelance work.	CHITCHAT
I'm working for yourself right is I would I probably worked like 12 hour days everyday.	CHITCHAT
4.	CHITCHAT
2.	CHITCHAT
2 1/2 to three years.	CHITCHAT
You know an.	CHITCHAT
After that I think it started to catch up with me.	CHITCHAT
You know work with some days working 16 hours.	CHITCHAT
This is when you know.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
What is it called?	CHITCHAT
Is called RTS.	CHITCHAT
Repetitive stress disorder or syndrome.	CHITCHAT
I think that's what it's called.	CHITCHAT
When that started to show up for me and I started to get like really awful wrist pains.	CHITCHAT
And that kind of bummed me out.	CHITCHAT
'cause then I couldn't paint.	CHITCHAT
And then when I couldn't paint, I felt like I was.	CHITCHAT
Just a waste of space and.	CHITCHAT
All this other stuff and then your brain does word literally are like our worst.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't out like not critic.	CHITCHAT
I guess we are that as well, but the thing that we need to watch out for.	CHITCHAT
The most is ourselves.	CHITCHAT
When were working for ourselves so you don't want to.	CHITCHAT
Well, I guess hurt yourself.	CHITCHAT
No, I'm trying to say like you don't.	CHITCHAT
You just don't want to burn out.	CHITCHAT
That's another aspect to which I think that's what I just got through just got over.	CHITCHAT
You know it effects our mental health.	CHITCHAT
I can say that I've also experienced that as well.	CHITCHAT
You know, that's constantly a regular.	CHITCHAT
In my life.	CHITCHAT
You know it ebbs and flows and I think I was talking about that.	CHITCHAT
Yesterday, yesterday's dream.	CHITCHAT
You know it's all just each kinda have to ride it out.	CHITCHAT
But in terms of like setting up your schedule.	CHITCHAT
Going back to like saying that I would definitely be.	CHITCHAT
I want to and I will be returning back to streaming on a regular.	CHITCHAT
You know, probably maybe four to five days a week.	CHITCHAT
I think between here and Twitch in the following weeks.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I think that would be.	CHITCHAT
A good reasonable schedule.	CHITCHAT
For about like, two to three hours I think.	CHITCHAT
That's what I'm thinking right now, but I'm not going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to say anything in stone for the for the sake of my schedule.	CHITCHAT
I need to make sure that things are.	CHITCHAT
Finished, you know?	CHITCHAT
That I can allow myself.	CHITCHAT
These windows of time to stream.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
OK, so that value there.	CHITCHAT
I think I want to add.	CHITCHAT
You know a little bit distracted by myself.	CHITCHAT
At this.	CHITCHAT
Right and in my mind I'm trying to think that of.	CHITCHAT
Not just this being a value, but I'm actually kind of.	CHITCHAT
Chiseling away.	CHITCHAT
Like I'm carving.	CHITCHAT
You know things that are shadows, you're kind of.	CHITCHAT
Carving into and things that are lighter, kind of.	CHITCHAT
Pulling the surface to you, I don't know.	CHITCHAT

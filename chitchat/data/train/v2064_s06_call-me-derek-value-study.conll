Maybe maybe that's.	CHITCHAT
That's something.	CHITCHAT
Helpful to share, but.	CHITCHAT
I find I find that that helps get my brain into.	CHITCHAT
Justifying word value goes.	CHITCHAT
This thinking like you're carving.	CHITCHAT
Right, but you also have to.	CHITCHAT
There's like different settings for your brain to always be jumping from.	CHITCHAT
Even though you still painting on the same image, you know the sketch part of my brain is completely different from.	CHITCHAT
From the line clean up part of my brain.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Or this maybe maybe this.	CHITCHAT
I'm still using that a little bit of a part of my brain.	CHITCHAT
OK, you know which is never mind.	CHITCHAT
Let Oh my goodness.	CHITCHAT
It's clearly you can see that part of my brain is underdeveloped.	CHITCHAT
Any other darker value areas?	O
Right here.	O
Just talking nonsense man.	CHITCHAT
Got here is a little bit lighter in value, but I think.	O
Go ahead and add that.	O
This.	O
You know, and then once you have all these kind of.	O
At.	CHITCHAT
Your dark value, your midtones, your light tones in there just comes down to blending the values together.	O
It's that easy.	O
You know what I'm getting at Dog, Yeah?	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
You know words?	CHITCHAT
Words do that thing.	CHITCHAT
Right exactly yeah exactly yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, yeah, exactly.	CHITCHAT
So I think we could probably even go a little bit darker in some of these values, so let's do that.	O
I'm still like I'm just trying to find the value that I want to use.	O
So that Button Press that you're hearing like this one here, not one that you're hearing.	O
That salt, right?	O
That gets the little eye dropper.	O
That's a default setting.	O
So just kind of.	O
Mix the values that I already have and then re sample.	O
I'm already getting into like just noodling, so I don't want to do that just yet.	O
Going here how you doing today, Marcel?	CHITCHAT
You doing dude.	CHITCHAT
Sentence was a mess, but I don't speak English as a first language, neither do I.	CHITCHAT
Well, I do, but.	CHITCHAT
I just don't have an excuse.	CHITCHAT
I have no excuse.	CHITCHAT
I was hoping that me lying would be.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
It's OK in the year 2020.	CHITCHAT
Just be a you know what.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to steer clear of that comment and just continue on.	CHITCHAT
What's a Derek today?	CHITCHAT
I'm fine.	CHITCHAT
Don't worry about it on the same totally fine.	CHITCHAT
We could.	CHITCHAT
Alright, no noodling so that dark value there aren't even.	O
It's a little gradient right here.	O
This is technically still noodling.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
A little bit in here.	O
Go up there.	O
We can mode.	O
It's good here dude.	CHITCHAT
That's good to hear, man.	CHITCHAT
There.	O
Alright, so under here throats doing something.	O
Upper lip Go even darker on this.	O
Area.	O
Go with that.	O
Something like that.	O

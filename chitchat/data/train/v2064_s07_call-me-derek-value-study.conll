It's going on yeah the Behance.	O
I don't know if, uh.	CHITCHAT
If it's common knowledge, but Adobe Adobe owns Behance.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I think, uh, because of a previous partner chip that we had back on Twitch that you reached out to me and a number of other.	CHITCHAT
Streamers and asked if they wanted to.	CHITCHAT
Have them work on their new streaming platform on their hands.	CHITCHAT
Which is great and I said absolutely.	CHITCHAT
For sure, so that's why you see me here.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I think for at least at least a month, at the very least a month.	CHITCHAT
And I think they're just trying to workout the Kinks trying to.	CHITCHAT
Make sure that.	CHITCHAT
It's in beta, right?	CHITCHAT
It's still in beta.	CHITCHAT
But they want to workout the kinks so they're getting.	CHITCHAT
As professional artists and Streamers.	CHITCHAT
To help him out.	CHITCHAT
With that and.	CHITCHAT
You know there is.	CHITCHAT
There is a partnership.	CHITCHAT
Papers have been signed.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But with that said, I'm still.	CHITCHAT
All about it, absolutely not a problem.	CHITCHAT
So what you're saying, Derek, is your shell?	CHITCHAT
Yes, 100%, that's me.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
No argument there.	CHITCHAT
But Having said that, I do plan on the plan was before all.	CHITCHAT
All hell broke loose.	CHITCHAT
On this on this planet of ours.	CHITCHAT
I was planning on going back to stream on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
There's a delay in that is going to be a delay in that.	CHITCHAT
Like I was talking about earlier scheduling.	CHITCHAT
My work schedule.	CHITCHAT
Things that I currently.	CHITCHAT
Have to finish and have to start and.	CHITCHAT
Blah blah blah.	CHITCHAT
And then once all that's all settled, I will be.	CHITCHAT
Working on moving my setup.	CHITCHAT
Into another room.	CHITCHAT
An streaming from there.	CHITCHAT
Right now it's.	CHITCHAT
Caroline, my girlfriend works from home as well.	CHITCHAT
This is not my normal screen stream stream time slot.	CHITCHAT
Usually I stream early in the mornings.	CHITCHAT
Over on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
I haven't streamed in, I think like a year and a half, honestly.	CHITCHAT
But I always always kind of planned on.	CHITCHAT
Returning And like I said before.	CHITCHAT
For all this Corona, all the Cove it.	CHITCHAT
Go ahead, say it like that.	CHITCHAT
I was planning on.	CHITCHAT
Going back to streaming and getting.	CHITCHAT
Internet put into that spare room.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
But don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I could still do that right now.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't feel comfortable enough.	CHITCHAT
Doing Like drilling into my walls and running CAT5 wire and.	CHITCHAT
Getting all set up for the Internet and other rooms.	CHITCHAT
I don't, I don't trust myself to do that.	CHITCHAT
It's just not.	CHITCHAT
It's just not something I've.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm not a handyman.	CHITCHAT
I could do certain things.	CHITCHAT
You know, like I can hang paintings and change light bulbs.	CHITCHAT
You know I can do that kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
But when it comes to like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, just whatever you would have to do for.	CHITCHAT
Setting up Internet into another room that's wired wired Internet right?	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't think why Pfizer Reliable.	CHITCHAT
Way to stream online.	CHITCHAT
So anyways.	CHITCHAT
Flattering, that's the plan.	CHITCHAT
Here in the weeks to come to get that set up.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm kind of going to like mid tone values now.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, man.	CHITCHAT

So Christian, you'll catch me here every Thursday and Friday.	CHITCHAT
Starting when.	CHITCHAT
40 minutes ago.	CHITCHAT
And will be gone for three hours.	CHITCHAT
Each day, there's name Friday every Thursday and Friday from here on out until Adobe realizes what they've done.	CHITCHAT
By hiring me.	CHITCHAT
To help promote their new platform.	CHITCHAT
But don't tell him.	CHITCHAT
Don't tell 'em yet.	CHITCHAT
Let me get a couple weeks in and then you guys can break the news.	CHITCHAT
This Derek I.	CHITCHAT
I don't, I don't trust him.	CHITCHAT
Got a beard now I don't think that's even real.	CHITCHAT
Yeah wife, we wouldn't cut it for upload.	CHITCHAT
Is is why?	CHITCHAT
And we have we have dead zones in our house.	CHITCHAT
Especially on that side of the house, like the Wi-Fi will just randomly drop from.	CHITCHAT
For no reason, like if I brought in my PS4.	CHITCHAT
Into the bedroom and use the TV in there and play the video games online.	CHITCHAT
I would just lose connection so.	CHITCHAT
I just rather have.	CHITCHAT
To be wired in, you know what I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
It sounds about right.	CHITCHAT
I think beginning of 2019 was the last dream I think so, like in February 2018, so it feels like it's been awhile.	CHITCHAT
It feels like it's been a long time so.	CHITCHAT
So I think I'm going to grab this brush here like very.	O
First brush their.	O
Not my very first brush but.	CHITCHAT
My brush brush that there.	O
It's got a little bit of a chalky kind of.	O
Texture actually you know what?	O
I'm gonna use.	O
I'm gonna use.	CHITCHAT
This one instead, which is still kind of like a chunky.	O
Yeah, that's a little bit more grit.	O
To it.	O
How's the?	CHITCHAT
How's the volumes guys?	CHITCHAT
Am I loud?	CHITCHAT
Is the music too loud?	CHITCHAT
Can you hear it for half the vad of yesterday's stream?	CHITCHAT
There's no music and I was like, Oh Man.	CHITCHAT
It's good timing on that when that song stopped and you guys didn't hear anything guys just just you are totally OK with letting me look like a complete idiot.	CHITCHAT
Which I can't blame you.	CHITCHAT
So good work.	CHITCHAT
Uh, the OG PS fours don't have dual band, so interference is an issue.	CHITCHAT
Yeah absolutely.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so that's why being wired in is is always better right?	CHITCHAT
And even then the PSN.	CHITCHAT
Download rates are just garbage anyways.	CHITCHAT
I hope that they have something a little bit better.	CHITCHAT
They probably won't for PS5.	CHITCHAT
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
Unless they've already released that information.	CHITCHAT
Which I don't think I'll be jumping on board.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I'll be an early buyer.	CHITCHAT
And I wasn't for the PS4 neither.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I didn't buy it as soon as they came out.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
'cause of PC games?	CHITCHAT
I think I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I just.	CHITCHAT
I spent I spent way more time gaming on my PC.	CHITCHAT
Gonna do my consoles.	CHITCHAT
Having said that, I still do want to PS five it's, I think at some point.	CHITCHAT
I have no plans on getting an Xbox.	CHITCHAT
I don't own a.	CHITCHAT
What are they called now?	CHITCHAT
The current ones?	CHITCHAT
Whatever, it doesn't really matter, but.	CHITCHAT
I guess I'd still like an insult and like insulting.	CHITCHAT
Insulting people who I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I'm not I really don't mean Oh, Oh God, I don't mean to insult anybody.	CHITCHAT
Who's button?	CHITCHAT
An Xbox, but I mean even though you did waste your money.	CHITCHAT
No offense to you, right?	CHITCHAT
Yikes, I thought Derek was a nice guy.	CHITCHAT
What happened?	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I know the new ones are called like X series or something like that.	CHITCHAT
But I can't remember the call now.	CHITCHAT
Xbox One.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's what it's called, right?	CHITCHAT
It's called it's called Xbox One.	CHITCHAT
And then the new ones coming out RX.	CHITCHAT
X series is that it's just called X Series.	CHITCHAT
It's I don't know, it's weird.	CHITCHAT
I like what Sony does and they just had the next number.	CHITCHAT

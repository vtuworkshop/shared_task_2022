Very straightforward.	CHITCHAT
Easy for idiots like me to figure out.	CHITCHAT
That the better one you know.	CHITCHAT
I buy this one now.	CHITCHAT
Here's my money.	CHITCHAT
You know it's got an SS drive in there, which I don't know the specs of.	CHITCHAT
the Xbox One, I'm assuming that's something they're going to add to.	CHITCHAT
All this technology is already in my current computer going to be adding to their.	CHITCHAT
Their next Gen.	CHITCHAT
And that's not that's not everybody you know, not everybody relies on their PC and needs to have it upgraded.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's what you do.	CHITCHAT
You know, I use this computer.	CHITCHAT
Every single day for work, right?	CHITCHAT
So I guess from my standpoint it would make sense that I would need to have a rig.	CHITCHAT
That is.	CHITCHAT
You know it's got some.	CHITCHAT
It's got some meat to it, right?	CHITCHAT
It's got some muscles.	CHITCHAT
To it, I don't know if it's.	CHITCHAT
That makes sense, but.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
It's a good computer, right?	CHITCHAT
So I can.	CHITCHAT
I can probably.	CHITCHAT
I can probably wait a bit.	CHITCHAT
If you know, I know there's definitely going to be Sony exclusives that all want to jump on.	CHITCHAT
I think that's right.	CHITCHAT
I think bloodborne yeah it was.	CHITCHAT
I think when bloodborne came out and I think that's when I picked up a PS4 'cause if there's if there's anything from Fromsoft That's exclusive to a console, I'll go ahead and justify that 'cause those games are just.	CHITCHAT
The type of games that I absolutely love.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't know if Eldon Ring is going to be exclusive.	CHITCHAT
2.	CHITCHAT
Sony I don't think so right.	CHITCHAT
I don't think it is.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
Think elder rings basically going to be there next Dark Souls, so it's going to be for all platforms all.	CHITCHAT
All gaming things.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
You can faintly hear the music.	CHITCHAT
How's that?	CHITCHAT
Can you hear it now?	CHITCHAT
Myself, or is it still really low?	CHITCHAT
That's probably better right there.	CHITCHAT
But you can still hear me.	CHITCHAT
Can you hear me like at the Level I'm speaking out right now over?	CHITCHAT
Over the music.	CHITCHAT
I've got a boost from my Wi-Fi.	CHITCHAT
It helps like I got something that you plug it into the wall.	CHITCHAT
Is that what you're talking about?	CHITCHAT
Like I plugged I have this thing plugged in the wall.	CHITCHAT
I have a cord going to it and then in our bedroom.	CHITCHAT
And I know that you can get ones that are literally just Wi-Fi adapters that you plug into the wall, but I had I have an old.	CHITCHAT
Router that's a fairly good one.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I just got the ones that have the CAT5.	CHITCHAT
Slight in them and just plug into them.	CHITCHAT
So this one goes.	CHITCHAT
To our living room sorry our bedroom from the living room and then goes into a router and then that's what blast continues blasting out the.	CHITCHAT
And the Wi-Fi signal.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why is it blasting out?	CHITCHAT
I'm at the perfect level cake, cool.	CHITCHAT
No, that's totally fine.	CHITCHAT
And still be fine.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, absolutely what you said earlier there.	CHITCHAT
Marcel, why buy the console when there's no?	CHITCHAT
Games now I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I know I'm saying or what your gnome saying.	CHITCHAT
Every Granny in her dog or on the Internet.	CHITCHAT
this Friday evening I have to watch 160P.	CHITCHAT
And it still buffers from time to time, like here Christian like on Behance.	CHITCHAT
Do you live is up 'cause you live in a?	CHITCHAT
Like I congested area that has a lot of people living there, apartment building type of thing.	CHITCHAT
A lot of interference with Wi-Fi signal.	CHITCHAT
Can you pick up the data?	CHITCHAT
Final cool?	CHITCHAT
I'll check that out later.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I didn't know about these things.	CHITCHAT
The basically uses your.	CHITCHAT
Your power lines, right?	CHITCHAT
It's just plugged right into the wall.	CHITCHAT
Where you normally use, you know appliances or charger phone.	CHITCHAT

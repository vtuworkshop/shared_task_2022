Whatever you can, you can plug your Internet into that.	CHITCHAT
It will travel through your power cords and then as long as it's connected to the same circuit, you can put another adapter into an outlet.	CHITCHAT
And then have Wi-Fi and in a different part of your house where you have like a dead dead zone.	CHITCHAT
Or I think that's what they call right dead zones.	CHITCHAT
Basically you have garbage, Internet, garbage, Wi-Fi and it fixes it up just like instantly.	CHITCHAT
The only downside of our setup that we have right now is you literally have to change your Wi-Fi setting on your phone or your iPad or computer.	CHITCHAT
If it's not automatically already picking it up.	CHITCHAT
I think Android 'cause I have an iPhone iPads.	CHITCHAT
I think androids they automatically released you can set.	CHITCHAT
Certain signals to, if this ones stronger, go to this one.	CHITCHAT
I thought that you could do that with iPhones, but sometimes still uses the Wi-Fi out here, even though it has like less bars.	CHITCHAT
Then the three bars that are in the bedroom.	CHITCHAT
So and again, that's that's that's above my pay grade to figure out that stuff.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I'm just happy that I got Wi-Fi in there working right.	CHITCHAT
That's that's.	CHITCHAT
A job well down in my books for me.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I think when I was younger I was a little bit more on top of things, you know.	CHITCHAT
But I was mainly for.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I should even saying this finding.	CHITCHAT
Let me let me find the words.	CHITCHAT
Playing, playing computer games, and like early like PS1 games.	CHITCHAT
And having other means of.	CHITCHAT
Getting those games.	CHITCHAT
And it.	CHITCHAT
And I value that is.	CHITCHAT
0 value $0.00.	CHITCHAT
I think that's ambiguous enough for you guys.	CHITCHAT
Understand what I'm trying to say.	CHITCHAT
I used to be able to do that stuff.	CHITCHAT
Like Softmodding, I think I can say that.	CHITCHAT
Like I was all about that like with my had a PSP that I could that was an emulator.	CHITCHAT
I guess I basically just outed myself right there.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm on the wrong layer.	O
Yeah, so I'm now painting literally on top of my.	O
Line layer.	O
So at this point, should I might as well just merge everything right at least two layers together?	O
Whatever, let's do that.	O
Yeah, so I was.	CHITCHAT
I was a little bit into.	CHITCHAT
Would you call that like computer engineering of some sort?	CHITCHAT
Like a teaspoon of Computer Engineering Engineering?	CHITCHAT
'cause I enjoyed it like I thought I thought doing that stuff is fun.	CHITCHAT
Now it's you know, I guess our interests.	CHITCHAT
Change in time, right as we get older.	CHITCHAT
I much rather just.	CHITCHAT
Save my money and wait until.	CHITCHAT
Either the sale or if there's a game that I really want to get, then I'll just.	CHITCHAT
I'll just.	CHITCHAT
I'll just pay him or just buy it.	CHITCHAT
I'll just buy the game.	CHITCHAT
Especially with music nowadays too, there's if there's an album that I like an album I just bought recently, like a gunship got, we listen to a lot of gunship over on.	CHITCHAT
On Twitch I'm really into just synth synth wave.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
The Midnight Gunship.	CHITCHAT
All all those other types of bands that I can't remember names of.	CHITCHAT
You know I'll support them.	CHITCHAT
I'll buy their albums back in the day.	CHITCHAT
That was never something that came across my mind.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I guess I guess.	CHITCHAT
Want it has to do with just having.	CHITCHAT
Disposable income, and not that I really do right now, but.	CHITCHAT
I can I can justify you know the 999 for an album that I'm going to get?	CHITCHAT
How many playthroughs, playthroughs, playbacks?	CHITCHAT
What do you call it like?	CHITCHAT
You're going to listen to this album.	CHITCHAT
More than $10 worth right?	CHITCHAT
So it's it's easy to justify that.	CHITCHAT
And you're supporting the artists, right?	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I'm noodling, so I'm going to go ahead.	O

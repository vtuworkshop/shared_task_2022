Get back to the mid tones.	O
And spacing here feels a little bit off.	O
So we might have to stretch some things out, but for now.	O
Just.	CHITCHAT
It's just the Rona, the Rona Internet, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I guess everyone being home bandwidth are.	CHITCHAT
It's disappointing and I guess like even even before the Rona, you know a lot of infrastructure for the Internet was.	CHITCHAT
Pretty garbage tier, right?	CHITCHAT
Now that we're all basically on it 24/7.	CHITCHAT
I don't even think I haven't finished that thought 'cause It's.	CHITCHAT
And less like there are.	CHITCHAT
There's some countries out there.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't really have too much issues.	CHITCHAT
Where I am 'cause I think I think where I'm at I have fiber op and I would assume.	CHITCHAT
I don't again, I don't know a whole lot about this kind of stuff, but I would assume that the stuff that they put in here is.	CHITCHAT
Somewhat modern, you know.	CHITCHAT
The technology.	CHITCHAT
Probably not.	CHITCHAT
It's probably running some old ancient.	CHITCHAT
Wires.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea.	CHITCHAT
I can't.	CHITCHAT
I can't say what it is, but.	CHITCHAT
I don't really have too many issues.	CHITCHAT
What do I have?	CHITCHAT
I think I have 505 hundred down.	CHITCHAT
That's what I have.	CHITCHAT
And I need I need that stuff for for what I do for living, right?	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy with it.	CHITCHAT
You know, I I could, it could be better.	CHITCHAT
You know here about the price is that.	CHITCHAT
Places in the EU.	CHITCHAT
Have further Internet.	CHITCHAT
And it's just like.	CHITCHAT
It's like 1/4 of what we pay.	CHITCHAT
I pay $130 for.	CHITCHAT
My Internet, but it's bundled with corn.	CHITCHAT
See, you gotta get the bundle.	CHITCHAT
It's bundled with two PV Rs.	CHITCHAT
One of them has a.	CHITCHAT
Hard drive on it.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
We don't really watch TV.	CHITCHAT
The girlfriend does a little bit from time to time.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Because that's probably where I could save a little bit of money, right?	CHITCHAT
Let's get that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I just I just even hate the idea of.	CHITCHAT
Picking up the phone to call the ISP right so ISPs are just never.	CHITCHAT
Never just pick up the phone and you're good, right?	CHITCHAT
So it's something not to complain to the people who are on the receiving end of the phone calls.	CHITCHAT
You know they're just, they're just doing their job.	CHITCHAT
I'll never, I'll never be an irate caller to a customer service representative.	CHITCHAT
Mainly because I've been one, and I know I know.	CHITCHAT
It's like just the.	CHITCHAT
Braided right and you have to take it right?	CHITCHAT
2 degree.	CHITCHAT
Because the good calls were when you're you could say that if you continue to speak this way in this, this this town and I'll be forced to terminate the call.	CHITCHAT
That's the worst that you could tell them, right?	CHITCHAT
Mam if you get you swear at me, I'm going to have to terminate call.	CHITCHAT
And that's That's it, and even then, I think there's some places where you can't even say that.	CHITCHAT
Switch.	CHITCHAT
Damn, you know.	CHITCHAT
Could save a not knocking.	CHITCHAT
People take calls it's well.	CHITCHAT
I mean like I know that you do it and I know that my girlfriend does it.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm not going to be sitting here.	CHITCHAT
Putting myself in the doghouse.	CHITCHAT
But mostly it's because I've been there.	CHITCHAT
You know, I worked.	CHITCHAT
I worked for A.	CHITCHAT
I was customer service representative for A.	CHITCHAT
Oil company.	CHITCHAT
For East Coast.	CHITCHAT
US So like the New York area.	CHITCHAT
New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts.	CHITCHAT
That area.	CHITCHAT
I did that for about a year.	CHITCHAT
And it was.	CHITCHAT
The worst thing ever.	CHITCHAT
You go into working.	CHITCHAT

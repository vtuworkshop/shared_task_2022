You do your web 10 hour, 12 hour shift and there was always.	CHITCHAT
Always a cube on the marquee that they had on the walls.	CHITCHAT
Of at least like 100 people.	CHITCHAT
Waiting in queue to talk to somebody.	CHITCHAT
It was awful man.	CHITCHAT
And it was some angry East Coast Americans.	CHITCHAT
Wanting oil for their house for winter.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Having said that, there were still some good times.	CHITCHAT
That was when, uh, like.	CHITCHAT
Now is when.	CHITCHAT
The gameboy SP.	CHITCHAT
I think there's like a gameboy advance, but it was foldable.	CHITCHAT
The Gameboy SP is about this big in the unfolded it, so it had a hinge and I had a screen and normal button set up like a gameboy does.	CHITCHAT
And I think the Final Fantasy, like the new Final Fantasy tactics.	CHITCHAT
Came out I think is Final Fantasy tactics advance.	CHITCHAT
I think that's what it was called.	CHITCHAT
That came out an I put probably.	CHITCHAT
Like 400 hours in that game, and I think that game alone kept me sane 'cause I could.	CHITCHAT
I could hide my Gameboy SP 'cause they're small, right?	CHITCHAT
And Final Fantasy games, specially tactics you can just.	CHITCHAT
Put our you just lose hours of your life into schemes, so that's exactly what I wanted to do when I was at work.	CHITCHAT
Just somehow Fast forward.	CHITCHAT
Do that.	CHITCHAT
And that's how I paid for Community College.	CHITCHAT
That's how I was able to afford.	CHITCHAT
Going to.	CHITCHAT
Animation school.	CHITCHAT
Course animation course I guess is what I should say.	CHITCHAT
Going through that.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
I think I was talking with someone else, but let's turn to thought.	CHITCHAT
Soft money is legit since you're just backing up games illegally owned.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's what I was doing absolutely.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for.	CHITCHAT
Covering my but you got my back there myself.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
There, have you seen midnight gospel on Netflix yet?	CHITCHAT
Please do if you haven't yet.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
The midnight got like is that the band, the midnight?	CHITCHAT
Or is that?	CHITCHAT
Is that something unrelated to?	CHITCHAT
I haven't.	CHITCHAT
I haven't seen that.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know what that is.	CHITCHAT
Do do tell if you don't mind.	CHITCHAT
The documentary.	CHITCHAT
What what did we watch we watched?	CHITCHAT
Oh, the R.	CHITCHAT
Kelly one.	CHITCHAT
Which was.	CHITCHAT
It was good, but there's a lot of like.	CHITCHAT
When it comes to documentaries and just really awful things happening to people.	CHITCHAT
It feels weird when they have all these like theatrical.	CHITCHAT
Edits, do you know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Like when I say theatrical edits like adding in suspenseful music and crazy cuts and editing techniques like.	CHITCHAT
Just like a document documentary should be information.	CHITCHAT
And then having people who experienced whatever it is.	CHITCHAT
Sharing their story, you know, reenactments with actors are fine.	CHITCHAT
I think that I think those really helpful.	CHITCHAT
But having a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Like movie edits and sounds and effects and stuff like that, I don't think that I think that kind of makes the their story disingenuous in.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm saying it might not be on Canadian Netflix, OK?	CHITCHAT
What VPN do you guys here?	CHITCHAT
What VPN do you guys use?	CHITCHAT
Nord is that the one that you guys like?	CHITCHAT
Just asking for a friend.	CHITCHAT
I hear good things with that one.	CHITCHAT
Just something non related.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so that's that's the latest thing I think I watched on Netflix.	CHITCHAT
What did I watch before that?	CHITCHAT
I don't, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I the Tiger, Man, Tiger King, Tiger Man, Tiger man, the Tiger man?	CHITCHAT

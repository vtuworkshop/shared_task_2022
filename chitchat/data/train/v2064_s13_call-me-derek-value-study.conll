Carole Baskin You know?	CHITCHAT
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
OK, I don't want to.	CHITCHAT
I just sampled some light value.	O
I don't want to do that just yet, so let's let's keep going in with the mid tones.	O
Darker values first.	O
If this document has a star, wipe it, lost its own points, yeah?	CHITCHAT
I don't think I don't think that R.	CHITCHAT
Kelly one has that, but it's just like there's definitely points.	CHITCHAT
In the documentary was like Oh Man, I like I don't have.	CHITCHAT
Something happened with my.	CHITCHAT
Emotions and feeling for these people going to these awful things when they added like thriller type music like like you're watching a thriller thriller movie.	CHITCHAT
Like Suspenseful Music playing is probably what it would say in the subtitles, like I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't like 2 degree.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's fine anyways.	CHITCHAT
You guys watch it and maybe you'll know what I'm saying.	CHITCHAT

Kelly A predator right awful.	CHITCHAT
OK, we are indeed noodling, so some of these shapes are a little.	O
Monkey.	O

Now it feels weird, definitely not.	O
Like in some of this, I think a lot of it has to do with just still seeing some messy line choices here.	O
Just clean it up.	O
Gonna get a shadow going underneath the eyelid.	O
Erase some of that excess stuff.	O
I think it's a little bit better.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I know, right?	CHITCHAT
It's in, I think that unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
We can there's such a good example that like I live in Canada, there's such a good example and I don't want to talk about this.	CHITCHAT
On any of my streams ever.	CHITCHAT
But I'll mention this as a reference.	CHITCHAT
It's happening, obviously it's happening all over the place in the world, but on a huge level, humongous, tremendous level where people.	CHITCHAT
With crazy amounts of money and wealth and power.	CHITCHAT
Are put into.	CHITCHAT
Powerful positions where they can kind of get away with doing awful, awful things right.	CHITCHAT
Just look at human history, right?	CHITCHAT
That's esentially what.	CHITCHAT
All the problems stem from.	CHITCHAT
If people.	CHITCHAT
Nazza having People surrounded by yes men, right?	CHITCHAT
This is a little bit too dubstep beat for me so.	CHITCHAT
Going to go ahead and change that one.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Try and stay focused here, Derek.	CHITCHAT
It's not going to happen, but.	CHITCHAT

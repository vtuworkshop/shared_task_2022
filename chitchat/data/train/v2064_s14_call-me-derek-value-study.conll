Can they let somebody else about?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Probably a good idea right now is to flip.	O
The canvas horizontally, so we can.	O
He slapped in the face with our mistakes.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to wait.	CHITCHAT
Minecraft made a little bit 'cause I'm terrified.	CHITCHAT
Of the truth.	CHITCHAT
I think we're gonna have to do it anyways.	CHITCHAT
I don't know would you guys prefer if I didn't play any music that way you could listen to your own.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I like streamers that do that so you can still have a stream on.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Not have to listen to.	CHITCHAT
Whatever they like to listen to or.	CHITCHAT
Well, for this case, this is Copyright free music, right?	CHITCHAT
So I can't.	CHITCHAT
I can't listen anything that has a Copyright.	CHITCHAT
Or else Adobe kits.	CHITCHAT
Gets a slap.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, maybe I'll ask that again later on.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Now it down here feels a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Squashed I think you'll pricey something.	CHITCHAT
Flip.	O
Every once you actually got the virus crazy.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know that.	CHITCHAT
Has he like?	CHITCHAT
Does he have it right now like?	CHITCHAT
I didn't know that.	CHITCHAT
You don't know how to Twitch.	CHITCHAT
No, it's not that difficult.	CHITCHAT
I mean literally.	CHITCHAT
If I could do it.	CHITCHAT
Anybody could?	CHITCHAT
I mean not to say that it was just like.	CHITCHAT
It might be different now I think.	CHITCHAT
I think when I first started to do it, there was some things that really confused me.	CHITCHAT
You know, but I think right now.	CHITCHAT
It's fairly streamlined.	CHITCHAT
There's tons of.	CHITCHAT
Guides and all that stuff nowadays.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just looking at this I this entire shape is very different than what the reference has.	O
But like I was saying yesterday, it's not.	CHITCHAT
Accuracy, it's nice to have, but man, it's I think it's far more important when you're able to just convey.	O
Information and effective way so make sense.	O
It doesn't have to be exactly like if we were to hide this, it would make that much of a difference.	O
You know, once this is finally done, it's not like you're always going to be holding the reference right next to it.	O
So I think.	O
Getting hold its own by itself.	O
Accuracy.	O
Doesn't really matter now when it comes to likeness.	O
If you're trying to paint someone's portrait and have it look like them, that's a little bit different, right?	O
I guess we will be doing that, but typically likeness is something that I focus on near the end.	O

Right?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's also something you don't really have to worry about when your sketch.	O
Your line drawing is accurate as well.	O
Oh, you keep recovering, unfortunately.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
That is another awful, awful human being.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
It seems weird to to watch other people play games when I myself could play not judgmental.	CHITCHAT
No, that's totally fine.	CHITCHAT
I think that's totally fair.	CHITCHAT
It's it's the same kind of outlook that I have for sports, right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But some people do they much rather just sit and watch the sport than partake.	CHITCHAT
For me, watching streams while I play video games, it's like.	CHITCHAT
It's because.	CHITCHAT
It's like I'm playing with somebody, right?	CHITCHAT
It's like somebody else is there, and it's even better than when having real friends.	CHITCHAT
Just 'cause you don't need to respond to them.	CHITCHAT
You don't need to.	CHITCHAT
Interact you can the options there when it comes to streaming as well.	CHITCHAT
It's like there's a chat and time to time I will respond and usually just typically what they call lurk, right?	CHITCHAT
You know that I'm, uh, that's all I do on Twitch and watching streams 'cause I get so frustrated trying to communicate.	CHITCHAT
I have a hard time communicating with my voice, let alone with my fingers on a keyboard.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm not a good type typist.	CHITCHAT
Type are.	CHITCHAT
So I just I just lurk.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
My thoughts move a lot quicker than my ability to.	CHITCHAT
To type.	CHITCHAT
That's pretty much it.	CHITCHAT
Like if there's and.	CHITCHAT
Also, it's kind of where I go to.	CHITCHAT
Check out what new games look like and how they play the game play right.	CHITCHAT
Let's just go check out a live stream.	CHITCHAT
Kind of work in there and decide whether or not this looks like a game that I'd ever be interested in playing.	CHITCHAT
I think that's what streaming is really good for as well.	CHITCHAT
The next thing is just.	CHITCHAT
You know the community since community.	CHITCHAT
It's nice to have.	CHITCHAT
And this is something that TV doesn't really do.	CHITCHAT
Is makes the viewer feel like they're part of something more than just.	CHITCHAT
An audience just being an audience member.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Whether that's true or not, you know in terms of.	CHITCHAT
You're still a stranger still, a complete stranger to to the streamer.	CHITCHAT
Most of the most in most cases most scenarios.	CHITCHAT
Not always, definitely not, but.	CHITCHAT
And that's something that you don't get with television.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes when I'm watching TV, I wish that there was like a like a live chat.	CHITCHAT
Just simply because, like emote spam and all these memes that are.	CHITCHAT
Solely on Twitch are absolutely hilarious.	CHITCHAT
And I hope that something that.	CHITCHAT
Adobe adds to Behance, is like emotes and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
That would be awesome.	CHITCHAT
We'll See and see if if if that's something that they do decide to add.	CHITCHAT
Definitely feeling weird.	CHITCHAT
Ha.	CHITCHAT
It's basically magic too.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, I guess there are emotes, but that's like the universal stuff.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So I guess maybe maybe they will have.	CHITCHAT
Like channel exclusive emotes at some point.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can see where I.	O
Painted on the other layer, and honestly what I should have done here?	O
What would have been probably a little bit more interesting to.	O
To see as we develop, this is the stages I should have kept different layers.	O
I guess we have this.	O
And then right there, right?	O
So it's not too far off from what original sketch was, and that's a good thing.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Now I think we pretty much get ready to.	O
Jump into like the more nuanced.	O
Highlights in Contrast and.	O
Rendering.	O
Phase Which is my favorite I absolutely love.	CHITCHAT
This is usually where time just kind of dissolves for me when I'm working on other.	CHITCHAT
Images.	CHITCHAT
When all all the guess work is finished.	O
For the most part is always surprises.	O
And you just kind of left to clean things up and render them out and make them look a little bit more polished, right?	O
When yeah, like any any stage or the painting where you can go or drawing or whatever it is you're doing where you can, kind of.	O
For lack of a better way to describe it, go on autopilot.	O
And just kind of Zen out.	CHITCHAT
You know the therapeutic side of.	CHITCHAT
Of creating something.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Schmees What's up dude?	CHITCHAT
Your test is successful dude.	CHITCHAT
You passed A plus.	CHITCHAT

Thanks for joining us on Behance behalf.	CHITCHAT
Going to be streaming over here, Thursdays and Fridays, 3 hours, probably just mainly doing studies.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Might do some commissions on here in the future.	CHITCHAT
We'll see a lot of my client work and a lot of the work that I do to keep the roof above my head.	CHITCHAT
I like to do without distractions and in the past on Twitch I've done.	CHITCHAT
What I call focus streams.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I really want to do.	CHITCHAT
Focus streams here.	CHITCHAT
I'd rather it be hopefully a little bit more entertaining for you guys and for me as well.	CHITCHAT
But welcome and welcome to anybody else who's who's hanging out here.	CHITCHAT
I certainly appreciate you guys watching.	CHITCHAT
I was blown away by how many people we had on our first stream.	CHITCHAT
I think we had over like 30 at one point, which to me is crazy.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm happy with.	CHITCHAT
More than one, so which that one would be me?	CHITCHAT
Either way, I certainly appreciate whoever tunes in.	CHITCHAT
And chills and hangs out.	CHITCHAT
As I make for myself on the Internet.	CHITCHAT
Which is always a good time for me.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Show me so.	CHITCHAT

I'm sorry dude.	CHITCHAT
My bad man.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you've been here even here all along.	CHITCHAT
So ignore what he said.	CHITCHAT
Midnight gospel recapped is a new cartoon made by Duncan Trussell.	CHITCHAT
What does that sound?	CHITCHAT
So he's a comedian, right?	CHITCHAT

He's isn't he Canadian.	CHITCHAT
Dunkin no, no.	CHITCHAT

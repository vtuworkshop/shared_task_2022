More than just like an act like a comedy act, right?	CHITCHAT
Opening up to, you know, dealing with depression and substance abuse, and other things like that.	CHITCHAT
It's in in talking about it.	CHITCHAT
I think that some of those.	CHITCHAT
So most comedians have enough of a following where they don't really need to do.	CHITCHAT
They don't need to do that stuff right.	CHITCHAT
They don't need to.	CHITCHAT
You know, promote.	CHITCHAT
Taking care of yourself right beyond your physical self.	CHITCHAT
You know your mind, your spirit, right?	CHITCHAT
If you want to call it that.	CHITCHAT
Which is great, it's refreshing.	CHITCHAT
Not having to just literally be.	CHITCHAT
An act that is solely to entertain right?	CHITCHAT
And I think that's probably why I like the streamers that I like.	CHITCHAT
You know, the live broadcasters.	CHITCHAT
Is there human man like that?	CHITCHAT
Talk about.	CHITCHAT
You know real issues that they're going on.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not to the point where there's always sharing.	CHITCHAT
They're dirty laundry in in 1 nine point.	CHITCHAT
You know there are at least.	CHITCHAT
Sharing that they're being proactive in trying to maintain a certain healthy.	CHITCHAT
Mind and body.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, but it's just.	CHITCHAT
I think it shows someone's character on the things that they are.	CHITCHAT
They use as entertainment.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I shouldn't get in get into this for the exact reason that I was going to.	CHITCHAT
Describe is it shows the type of person that you are.	CHITCHAT
You know, if you surround yourself with kind of negative and toxic things, you're going to be probably negative and toxic person.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
When I used to play a lot more like League of Legends in counterstrike, my I found that my vocabulary might attitude slowly changed overtime to the vocabulary and attitudes that you would find within those gaming communities.	CHITCHAT
And it was just like you have a moment we're sitting down here like why why my so upset about something so done?	CHITCHAT
Did you know in the big picture and having perspective when you're playing these games, it's a rare thing because you're so involved in the game.	CHITCHAT
You know you want to win.	CHITCHAT
You want to.	CHITCHAT
You want your teammates to do their job and you know it's a competitive in nature.	CHITCHAT
and I get that.	CHITCHAT
But same time I had to step away from those games.	CHITCHAT
I think back in the early 2000.	CHITCHAT
8 ish.	CHITCHAT
League of Legends.	CHITCHAT
And I think there's there's plenty of other.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't necessarily have to be a video game.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
My point is that there's other podcasts, other TV shows, other networks.	CHITCHAT
That's they thrive off of sharing that kind of.	CHITCHAT
Negative.	CHITCHAT
Toxic.	CHITCHAT
Line manipulated, manipulative context and content that people hunger for, but it just it corrodes your brain.	CHITCHAT
Sing for me.	CHITCHAT
But to each their own, right?	CHITCHAT
Not here too.	CHITCHAT
Dictate someone's interests.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
OK, we should probably flip this too, right?	O
At some point, find the courage, dig deep and face our fear of.	CHITCHAT
Being told the truth.	CHITCHAT
So when you see the mirrored image of something you're painting.	O
It shows you stuff right taking out.	O
Basically.	O
Now I know where I'm going with this.	O
Some of it's uncomfortable, yeah, check out wait three months by Neal Brennan.	CHITCHAT
That name sounds familiar as well.	CHITCHAT
Is that is that something on Netflix, the Neal Brennan thing?	CHITCHAT
Merced was data.	CHITCHAT
A podcast.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's you know, let's do it.	O

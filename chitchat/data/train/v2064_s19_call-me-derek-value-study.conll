I think it's alright.	O
I think it's alright.	CHITCHAT
And I think the reason why it's alright.	O
It's 'cause we took the time is his mandible.	O
The jar looks like it's kind of.	O
Pushed into far, his nose is pointing down a little bit too much.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But I think it's fine.	O
Specially since we can do this stuff, troll alt, shift E going to hit L to get the last time tool.	O
I'm just going to make a circle.	O
He controlled J.	O
So what I did, I'll go over what I did.	O
Real quick here, emerged everything into its own flat and layer right and then from there I continue to use the lasso tool and then probably one of the coolest things that somebody in the chat is told me to try out in photo shop from back in.	O
That which days is control J hitting control and J together turns that selection.	O
Into a new layer and not only does it turn into a new layer, a copy, paste, sit in the exact spot.	O
Where do you select it, which might not sound like a big deal, but if you're a numbskull like me, I just said Numbskull.	O
If you're a non still like me before I used to just do this control C control V right?	O
And in this case it worked fine.	O
It didn't paste it exactly in the right spot.	O
Or did it?	CHITCHAT
Yeah I did.	CHITCHAT
It's just that's yeah, this is a rare case or it will put it.	O
Where it will paste.	O
In the right spot, usually it's kind of like off and just a just a little bit like that.	O
And then you have to kind of painstakingly put in the right spot so when you hit CTRL J.	O
It resolves that.	O
Copy paste, issue.	O
Anyways, control J and then next I'll take control T.	O
I'm going to go at the top here.	O
Click on this thing this will.	O
Put these nine squares.	O
On your selection, and it's basically like a mesh now, so I can kind of warp this.	O
Right, so this is how you can get some crazy effects.	O
But also get some subtle ones too like this.	O
So if we just want that knows that go up just a little bit.	O
We can do that.	O
So basically just turns into.	O
Really malleable.	O
Play.	O
And I'm looking at the cheeks.	O
This chick is.	O
Really really, really wide.	O
So we might have to shave that a little bit.	O
Outlook.	O
That any better?	CHITCHAT
I think that's a little bit better than what we had.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think I will.	CHITCHAT
I'll do the same thing.	O
This might be a little bit different though.	O
I think I have to merge everything, so I'm going to just duplicate this for the sake of archiving or progress and emerged all of this together.	O
And then make a selection.	O
Right around here.	O
You can go all the way up.	O
Maybe not this, maybe we'll get this out.	O
And then just try this control TV control H and.	O
Capital.	O
Camping Maybe something like that?	O
Let's keep it.	O
There still feels like it's not.	O
Completely accurate, but again, like I said earlier and even yesterday, it's not always about the accuracy, it's about.	O
Effectiveness I guess.	O
And believability when you look at this.	O
Does it?	CHITCHAT
Does it feel like?	CHITCHAT
Does it feel like the the reference, I guess?	O
I don't know it really.	CHITCHAT
It really does depend on what you're trying to get out of it.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
I want to improve my understanding of value in lighting right?	O
How something should look?	CHITCHAT
In a certain lighting, in this case, it's.	O

Depending on the brushes, 'cause some brushes are a little bit more heavy handed.	O
And they might apply the paint digital paint a little bit too opaquely.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
The flow basically changes how much paint that's on your brush.	O
It will still be the same value.	O
It will just come out of the brush tip a little bit slower, so I like.	O
I like my Nana little bit lower side.	O
That way I can slowly build up right.	O
It allows you to build up your value, so even though you have maybe let's say you have a darker value selected, it doesn't necessarily mean that when you put down a brushstroke, it's going to be that value, right?	O
And of course, if you have pressure sensitivity.	O
Other synthetic or tablet you can go ahead and print the press a little bit harder, but you know.	O
It's essentially allows you to have a little bit more control.	O
And I'm naturally like heavy handed.	O
I think that's something to to kind of counter counteract.	O
My tremor is all press a little bit hard when I'm drawing, so I that's also part of why I really enjoy.	O
Adjusting the flow of paint brushes in Photoshop.	O
Myself freelancing yes yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'll be taking probably a lot less freelance as a as time goes on.	CHITCHAT
Trying to open up the schedule to be able to allow more streaming.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But for now I do have.	CHITCHAT
A few commissions to get started on in a few others to ramp up.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
I always struggle with eyes.	CHITCHAT
Specially making them feel like.	CHITCHAT
They are embedded into your skull, right?	CHITCHAT
Like there are there in a socket.	CHITCHAT
I think most of that comes.	CHITCHAT
Or why it's not so believable from my artwork is.	CHITCHAT
I tend to avoid drawing eyelids.	CHITCHAT
For some reason I just need to not do that.	CHITCHAT
Just don't do that anymore, and I think I should be fine.	CHITCHAT
But not do that.	CHITCHAT
I mean start drawing eyelids.	CHITCHAT
So maybe that's something that we can probably do.	CHITCHAT
One of these weeks is worked on.	CHITCHAT
Eyes.	CHITCHAT
Faces in general man just like just faces.	CHITCHAT
We can probably do a couple of exercises where we I think I've done this in the past where we Draw Something from reference and then we try and draw it again from memory.	CHITCHAT
I think that's always a good exercise.	CHITCHAT
And probably one of the better ones, the stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a clipping mask here.	O
OK.	O
This might be a bit cringe, but I have Mr.	CHITCHAT

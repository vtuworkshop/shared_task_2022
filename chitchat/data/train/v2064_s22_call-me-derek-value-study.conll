Stream Derek.	CHITCHAT
It's nice to catch up.	CHITCHAT
That's not cringe at all, man.	CHITCHAT
I honestly I really miss streaming.	CHITCHAT
As well, man like it's we need.	CHITCHAT
It was such a part of my life that.	CHITCHAT
You know, if it was weird not streaming all the time, it really was.	CHITCHAT
You know, and I plan on changing that for sure.	CHITCHAT
With that said, I still it wasn't always feeling weird.	CHITCHAT
There's there's times when.	CHITCHAT
You know, I.	CHITCHAT
I needed to focus, you know, I need to focus on.	CHITCHAT
Put in the work out there.	CHITCHAT
And there definitely is something to be said about streaming and.	CHITCHAT
Being effective and painting at your best level and when I'm when I'm streaming, I definitely not.	CHITCHAT
You know, 'cause I consistently distracting myself.	CHITCHAT
You know when I'm painting, I wish I was able to do this.	CHITCHAT
I wish I was able to just like speak and completely focus on what I'm working on.	CHITCHAT
But it's just it's so difficult to do.	CHITCHAT
Which is why I would throw in some focus streams right back in the day where I would just literally.	CHITCHAT
Not speak and not have a camera and just focus on the painting.	CHITCHAT
And while I was doing that I was broadcasting my canvas.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I mean, those are still, I think that maybe not necessarily when I do it, but there's still some valuable.	CHITCHAT
Some value that can be.	CHITCHAT
Like that?	CHITCHAT
It's not just a waste of data being sent out into the Internet.	CHITCHAT
But that was, you know, that's the truth of it is that I'm not as efficient, and I'm not as effective.	CHITCHAT
At painting.	CHITCHAT
On stream as I am when I'm not right, I think that I think that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
You know that wouldn't take much time to convince somebody that that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
But I certainly enjoy streaming man.	CHITCHAT
It's very therapeutic.	CHITCHAT
You know, especially for somebody, especially during these times, you know it's so strange too.	CHITCHAT
To have basically everybody now understands what it's like to work at home consistently.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's awesome.	CHITCHAT
It's great, but the novelty will wear out right?	CHITCHAT
And you'll start to kind of go a little bit crazy.	CHITCHAT
And I don't have very many people to kind of hang out with.	CHITCHAT
And you know, I'm in that age that demographic age were people are focusing on their careers focusing on the families you know, getting a home.	CHITCHAT
All these things like that that are very adult orientated.	CHITCHAT
Totally justifiable over spending time with anybody else, right?	CHITCHAT
I'm the same way I have certain things that I just need to focus on and some sacrifices that have to be made.	CHITCHAT
You know, spending time with friends, you know family.	CHITCHAT
All that stuff is kind of like a sacrifice to trying to get a little bit of progress on.	CHITCHAT
On your art or whatever it is you're trying to work on, you know.	CHITCHAT
So now with what's going on in the world, it's kind of like everyone.	CHITCHAT
It's funny 'cause they're living literally my lifestyle.	CHITCHAT
And they have no choice.	CHITCHAT
It's interesting these are so these are the most interesting times man.	CHITCHAT

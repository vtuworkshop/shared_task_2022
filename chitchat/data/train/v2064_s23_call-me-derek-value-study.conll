Hum.	CHITCHAT
I think I was going somewhere with it, but again, train of thought.	CHITCHAT
Evaporated.	CHITCHAT
Nothing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, absolutely.	CHITCHAT
I think this is this is kind of what we have to do anyways when it comes to.	CHITCHAT
The current situation raises a lot of people are discovering discord and a lot of people are discovering streams and they're using zoom or whatever application.	CHITCHAT
To communicate with their friends that they would normally just, you know.	CHITCHAT
Go hang out with.	CHITCHAT
IRL You know it's.	CHITCHAT
It was different ways to.	CHITCHAT
Spend time with your friends and family.	CHITCHAT
I still consider that you know hanging out.	CHITCHAT
From people just hanging out in a voice call to people visiting each other and Animal Crossing, and I'm spending time with your friends.	CHITCHAT
In a game world.	CHITCHAT
It might not be the real thing you know, like actually hanging out with somebody, but you can certainly.	CHITCHAT
Do a good job in.	CHITCHAT
Come on.	CHITCHAT
Hitting that spot right?	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's not the best way to put it.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
A temporary substitute.	CHITCHAT
For the real thing.	CHITCHAT
But I can honestly take her to leave it.	CHITCHAT
Because people are awful.	CHITCHAT
The rule in terms of the real world, right?	CHITCHAT
Going outside is the worst.	CHITCHAT
And now it literally is.	CHITCHAT
So like my lifestyle is completely justified.	CHITCHAT
During all this.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's a good thing or not.	CHITCHAT
That's something to be proud of.	CHITCHAT
It's strange.	CHITCHAT
No very introverted.	CHITCHAT
Completely content, being a homebody.	CHITCHAT
All my hobbies that you know when it comes down to.	CHITCHAT
Trying to pass time.	CHITCHAT
All my favorite things to do.	CHITCHAT
I do at home, right?	CHITCHAT
I like just to.	CHITCHAT
There's a game that I'm playing, I'll play that and then have have a stream open and that's kind of it if I'm not doing that, then I'm watching movies.	CHITCHAT
Hang out with the girlfriend on the couch, right?	CHITCHAT
If I'm not doing that, and if I do decide to go outside, it's probably to walk the dog right?	CHITCHAT
And that's kind of it.	CHITCHAT
Very very basic, very simple stuff.	CHITCHAT
But I'm extremely content doing those things.	CHITCHAT
You barely get what he's doing right now like what I'm doing right here.	CHITCHAT
Are you talking about me myself?	CHITCHAT
Right now I'm still just like Noodling and what that means is.	O
You know, I'm kind of jumping all over the place and just kind of.	O
Trying trying to make things a little bit more correct and accurate.	O
And applying a little bit more value.	O
Painting a little bit more where I think needs to be painted a little bit more.	O
Well, still trying to maintain a sense of.	O
Form right sense of that?	CHITCHAT
3D.	O
Feeling.	O
Even though this is on a 2D surface.	O
Using the values.	O
To create that.	O
Optical illusion that it's 3D.	O
Yes, I am in position.	O
I guess we are right.	O
I think it's valid to be a little bit darker.	O

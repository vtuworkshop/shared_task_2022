I don't know, maybe all of it can be a little bit darker.	O
I don't know how I feel about that.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back, actually pretty here.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
What's up, moose?	CHITCHAT
How you doing, man?	CHITCHAT
I hope you have a Good Friday.	CHITCHAT
Please get this stretch out, oh.	O
I encourage you guys to stretch is well, all is so good.	O
The risk going right?	O
Oh But it means I get the concept, but the execution seems bananas to me.	CHITCHAT
I can understand that.	O
Yeah, I mean like.	CHITCHAT
Anything, anything that's, uh.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Viewed Without Practice, I guess, like if you haven't done this and you haven't practiced in your scene for the first time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I can actually get.	CHITCHAT
Why would?	CHITCHAT
Boggle the brain.	CHITCHAT
But at the same time I don't think it's necessarily appropriate for me to reply like going, oh it's easy.	CHITCHAT
You know, like This Is, This is a skill that takes time to develop.	CHITCHAT
As you are well aware.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
It's kind of like how can I?	CHITCHAT
How can I put this?	CHITCHAT
Marcels musician, so I'd say it's kind of like being able to.	CHITCHAT
How you would learn a new song?	CHITCHAT
You would.	CHITCHAT
See the chords person who's never played guitar.	CHITCHAT
Or any other musician or musical instrument you know for you.	CHITCHAT
You can be told what the chords are in like OK then, then you kind of figure it out and this is how the summer sale plays guitar.	CHITCHAT
He only has a really small miniature guitar.	CHITCHAT
You know he plays it mirrored as well.	CHITCHAT
This is mirrored.	CHITCHAT
Now we just do that, but he most likely would be able to play it pretty quickly and learn how to play it pretty quickly.	CHITCHAT
Compared to somebody who just literally picking up the guitar for the first time, you know, and that's I guess I already know what the chords are.	CHITCHAT
For this example, which is an awful example.	CHITCHAT
I was trying Marcel, I'm trying.	CHITCHAT
Comparative type things.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I think we'll start adding a little bit this lighter value.	O
In here.	O
Another way to add this lighter value with beach it.	O
Slap on like an overlay layer.	O
I think we're going to do that too.	O
So now I'm kind of just relying on the texture of this brush.	O
Right like this brush right here if I just.	O
Bob Ross is, you know, literally just kind of.	CHITCHAT
Capital.	CHITCHAT
You know it's it's kind of nice texture which can be used for anything.	O
You can use.	O
This brush itself is so versatile.	O
You know when you actually just trying to render with it, it creates a nice kind of buildup of paint that is really appealing.	O
But also, when like I said, when you kind of.	O
T app it creates this nice texture as well.	O
So I'm going to take advantage of that with this brush.	O
And hopefully.	O
Make it feel like this is made out of stone.	O
Whatever this material is.	O
Yeah, like this island feels too small.	O
Probably flip it back to.	O
It took you 4 hours ago into the office man.	CHITCHAT

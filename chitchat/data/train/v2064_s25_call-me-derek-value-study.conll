Now is that because of like?	CHITCHAT
Certain security put in place.	CHITCHAT
Or is that a combination of that and like distance just time to get to the office?	CHITCHAT
Either way, like being outside right now is.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Not a place where I would.	CHITCHAT
Wanna spend too much time?	CHITCHAT
I mean, that's.	CHITCHAT
Even when it's not an epidemic.	CHITCHAT
Outside's awful.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure I'm going to be really excited.	CHITCHAT
Happy to spend some time outside.	CHITCHAT
When deemed appropriate.	CHITCHAT
In two hours.	CHITCHAT
Now.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's right.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you doing a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Ascend stuff, yeah, that's right.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Audio, Covent of what you're doing right now, right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so it's it's a language, right like?	CHITCHAT
Understanding my eyes are so used to seeing certain values right in being able to kind of take things apart when I look at them on like I can, I can literally turn them into.	O
A pliable pieces right?	O
I can separate them in layers in my own head, and that's how Photoshop Photoshop can easily work that way as well.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
You know, if you're able to listen to a song, you can kind of.	CHITCHAT
If you have a good ear, I guess in this case actually that's a really good.	CHITCHAT
That's literally what I'm doing is like.	CHITCHAT
This is the song, you know, the references, the song.	CHITCHAT
If I'm hearing it for the first time, I'm seeing this for the first time, or at least sitting down to do a reference of it or study of it.	CHITCHAT
You know you can kind of listen.	CHITCHAT
See what chord progression is the strum pattern.	CHITCHAT
And I guess that would be an exercise for the ear.	CHITCHAT
You know this is more or less an exercise for the eye.	CHITCHAT
Is it there?	CHITCHAT
Oh, shower painting is.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it is obnoxious voice.	CHITCHAT
I just made up.	CHITCHAT
To represent somebody I don't know who.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
The song with this I that's like really funky.	CHITCHAT
This is this is that detective work right?	CHITCHAT
No paintings.	CHITCHAT
Even if it is a study, it's just kind of literally, you're just trying to solve a mystery as to why it doesn't look correct.	CHITCHAT
Or to make it more appealing or something along those lines.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it looks really strange.	CHITCHAT
And so you just keep keep working on it, right?	CHITCHAT
Sometimes just painting over it, starting from scratch is.	CHITCHAT
The best way to go.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you sticking with it, maybe even taking a break, right?	CHITCHAT
You can either start painting some another another area of your painting, come back to this area.	CHITCHAT
You know little bit later or literally, put the painting away and.	CHITCHAT
Get up and walk around.	CHITCHAT
I find that that taking actual brakes.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of benefit in that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this feels like I'm trying too hard to match things where it's just getting.	CHITCHAT
It's becoming flat.	CHITCHAT
Which is the exact opposite of one trying to do.	CHITCHAT
Travel OK, so the time to actually travel with security stuff.	CHITCHAT
Waiting for tech support to arrive and then my computer operating system needed an update at the worst possible time.	CHITCHAT
Yikes.	CHITCHAT
I can hear a squirrel fart across the street.	CHITCHAT

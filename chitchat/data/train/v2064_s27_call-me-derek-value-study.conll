I could put a multiply layer on this in darkened areas, but also literally do what I just did there and stay on the same layer and just with as long as I'm using a value that's darker than.	O
Value that I'm painting over.	O
That will therefore make everything darker.	O
So I could do something like that.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
I think we'll just keep that.	O
It might be a little bit too dark, but.	O
Just payment of this anyways.	O
OK, so I think what I will do to add in.	O
The brightness to add in the lighter values is I'll make a new layer, hold alt between these two layers so it clips on as well.	O
'cause we can add as many layers.	O
You know as we want.	O
Onto the same base here, right?	O
So this is still their base.	O
This one right here where it used to look.	O
Used to look like that, right?	O
That's our base now.	O
We're painting on top of that, so let's turn this into.	O
I wanted to add a overlay.	O
Layer here and.	O
Paint on some white.	O
The broad kind of brush.	O
We might have to use like a software, and I think this might be fine.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
So I see a lot of value, light getting kind of trap right here.	O
That's that's another thing about doing, you know, studies from life.	O
Photos I guess.	O
Of things from life is you start to recognize.	O
Patterns that light.	O
Especially in the face, right?	O
Were light will tend to always hit.	O
And the more that you study it right, the more that you can apply that.	O
To your own work.	O
Hopefully.	CHITCHAT
Much tool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, don't you make it harder for yourself by not making the background light as well.	O
I know well, so here's why I don't have the background white is because it's too intense for my eyes.	O
That's literally it.	O
It's just too much white shining on my eyes.	O
It just starts to irritate them.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
That's I think that's literally it.	O
And at the end of it, I probably will.	O
Add a layer that is black and white.	O
And even even just having like a Gray or black, it's to compare.	O
Your values to see if you're accurate or not, right?	O

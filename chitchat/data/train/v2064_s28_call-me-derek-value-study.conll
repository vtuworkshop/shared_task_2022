Maybe if we did this.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that was a good idea or not, see.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
And again I need to.	O
Remind myself.	O
That the primary objective isn't 100 cent likeness rights not 100% accuracy.	O
It's it's being able to see what I want out of.	O
This is being able to understand or get a better understanding or to learn a little bit more about lighting.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
I think I still will.	O

Try to move this.	O
A little bit.	O

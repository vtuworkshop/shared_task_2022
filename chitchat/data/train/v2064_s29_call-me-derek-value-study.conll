Let's see that.	CHITCHAT
I think that would be a little bit too.	CHITCHAT
Now I think we need to move the lip or.	O
Yeah, I feel like I like the nose now.	O
I like I like the nose now.	CHITCHAT
Now the bottom lips looking weird A.	O
Running out of shows to watch.	CHITCHAT
I think that's I think that's it.	CHITCHAT
I think it's literally what's happening.	CHITCHAT
Tales from the loop.	CHITCHAT
Re watch Galaxy Quest making making of documentary.	CHITCHAT
See, that sounds really familiar.	CHITCHAT
Galaxy quest I don't think I've seen that, let alone the documentary of the making of.	CHITCHAT
But it sounds really familiar moves.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
It's like I think it's probably.	CHITCHAT
Fair to say that at this point it's basically just all about jumping around.	O
From one area to the next, and.	O
Back again.	O
I'm not consistently staying too long.	O
At any particular area.	O
I don't know, maybe maybe there's more benefit in doing that.	O
Maybe I should say in an area to finish, but the reason for me?	O
That way I justify.	O
Is.	O
You don't want to push something too far, and then when you go to another area of your study of your painting.	O
In comparatively.	O
What you just finished working on makes everything else look out of whack.	O
I think the likelihood of that happening if you just focus on one area is fairly high.	O
Over.	CHITCHAT
You know, just kind of jumping around, but I don't know that's.	CHITCHAT
That's the great thing about.	CHITCHAT
Art and painting and learning is that what might work for me doesn't always necessarily.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it's the only way.	CHITCHAT
To do it right.	CHITCHAT
I thought like Beastie Boys was going to play for a second there.	CHITCHAT
You Will it happen?	CHITCHAT
Thank you back.	CHITCHAT
I'm saying can actually use the real words 'cause.	CHITCHAT
First of all, I don't know them in second of all Copyright.	CHITCHAT
Intergalactic anybody know, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Galaxy quest was one of the movies was the movie about actors of a sci-fi show that were taken into space by real aliens who thought the show was real.	CHITCHAT
Wow, yeah no.	CHITCHAT
I haven't seen that.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I've even heard of it.	CHITCHAT
That sounds crazy.	CHITCHAT
What a wild concept.	CHITCHAT
What did I see it?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think it's just 'cause it's got the word quest.	CHITCHAT
On the end of it, and.	CHITCHAT
So many titles, video games and TV shows, movies, whatever.	CHITCHAT
That share that?	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's what my brains.	CHITCHAT
Telling me.	CHITCHAT
I think we just seem like break up these edges.	O
A bit.	O
What is it called sfumato?	O
What is called when you kind of like?	CHITCHAT

Make something a little bit blurry.	O
We can't tell where it begins where it ends.	O
Typically that happens in like shadowy areas, right?	O
Spell motto Sometimes it surprises me what words stick with me.	CHITCHAT
And then I can't remember like the most basic of things names.	CHITCHAT
I am really looking forward looking forward to.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm not, but.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited to see where technology is able to take us with the what is it called the cyberlink or whatever that Elon Musk A is working on?	CHITCHAT
I can remember it's called, you know, imagine just being able to download things into your head.	CHITCHAT
Communicate with your devices without having to touch them.	CHITCHAT
You know, like that sounds cool, but like our reality is so awful.	CHITCHAT
That is not going to go that way.	CHITCHAT
It's probably not going to go that way.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I want to be the first.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, maybe maybe I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It really depends.	CHITCHAT
I'd have to see what the.	CHITCHAT
The prototype does.	CHITCHAT
Neural link is that what it's called?	CHITCHAT
I don't like Are we going to be able to upload experience, you know, let's say, let's say, if that's if that's something that we can.	CHITCHAT
Turn into some type of data that we can upload into our brains, right?	CHITCHAT
And what I mean is.	CHITCHAT
If you're somebody who's done something for years.	CHITCHAT
If that if that stored somewhere is in her brain, is there a way to take that from one person and with the neural link, right?	CHITCHAT
Let's save the technologies out there and it's it's.	CHITCHAT
There's no flaws to it, right?	CHITCHAT
This?	CHITCHAT
Unrealistic, hyper hypothetical example?	CHITCHAT
Are you able to pass experience onto somebody else, just the uplink or that download?	CHITCHAT
I don't know, maybe it's just me who thinks about this type of weird stuff, but.	CHITCHAT
Tell me interesting.	CHITCHAT
When the day comes when we're ready to test it out, if we haven't already.	CHITCHAT
I know my heads all over the place.	CHITCHAT
Guys started with scatter brain.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Is.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I know that's what I'm saying is like how would would that technology.	CHITCHAT
This is conspiracy theory stuff right now.	CHITCHAT
So get your tinfoil out.	CHITCHAT
If it's not already.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if that would even be allowed 'cause it would undermine a lot of establishments that are already.	CHITCHAT
You know, like University schools, or maybe that's where they store the information, right?	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's where they store it and you have to apply.	CHITCHAT
To sign up to get that.	CHITCHAT
Connection to be able to get the uplink from these universities that have this is the data for becoming a doctor or this is the data becoming sewn.	CHITCHAT

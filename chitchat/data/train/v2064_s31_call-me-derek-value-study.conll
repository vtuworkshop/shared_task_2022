So whatever you just pay for Ohio, be just like the OB.	CHITCHAT
Oh, look at this guy.	CHITCHAT
I always a Greyhound.	CHITCHAT
Adam for.	CHITCHAT
Four years, three years.	CHITCHAT
Go lay down.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Damn buddy.	CHITCHAT
So I'm grabbing this camera at a weird angle.	CHITCHAT
He was napping in his kennel and now he's going to nap is going to take a break from napping in his kennel to nap on his bed.	CHITCHAT
That's his life, man.	CHITCHAT
That's that's literally what he does.	CHITCHAT
Every single day.	CHITCHAT
Every day, that's what he does.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Somebody on your bed.	CHITCHAT
What's the saying?	CHITCHAT
Something about you know, I don't know if it was even worth remembering.	CHITCHAT
Oh, neural links.	CHITCHAT
That's right.	CHITCHAT
Let's keep talking about that.	CHITCHAT
It's such an interesting topic.	CHITCHAT
A great guys, right, right?	CHITCHAT
Heard Greyhounds were kind of lazy and shot.	CHITCHAT
You heard correctly.	CHITCHAT
They are perfect.	CHITCHAT
They they.	CHITCHAT
When getting a dog, it's always best to get an energy level of breed or an energy level.	CHITCHAT
I guess all breeds can typically have wide variety of energy levels.	CHITCHAT
There's not always.	CHITCHAT
Designated too.	CHITCHAT
You know what they are most common for.	CHITCHAT
But typically greyhounds are extremely lazy.	CHITCHAT
In there like cats, they just sleep all day.	CHITCHAT
And you can wear them out really easily.	CHITCHAT
So that means like the walks don't have to be like an hour long.	CHITCHAT
You know it could be.	CHITCHAT
Anywhere is from like.	CHITCHAT
20 minutes to 45 minutes so it's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not like a crazy struggle to keep them healthy.	CHITCHAT
But that's why you know, before I had Obi I had.	CHITCHAT
Chocolate Labrador, Django.	CHITCHAT
Maybe some you guys remember Django?	CHITCHAT
And she was very high energy, as labradors typically are, so they need exercise.	CHITCHAT
Need they need an hour walk everyday?	CHITCHAT
I had Django treadmill trained.	CHITCHAT
Right, and that's where you can basically.	CHITCHAT
Be really lazy and just walk your dog on a treadmill.	CHITCHAT
And when I say walk your dog on treadmill I didn't even have to be there as long as I was in the same room supervising and make sure that she was OK.	CHITCHAT
You know she could.	CHITCHAT
Get the exercises that she needed.	CHITCHAT
And stay healthy, right?	CHITCHAT
That said, it doesn't mean never took it to places that are running around and stuff.	CHITCHAT
I think that's still really important for dogs.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
They're not necessarily.	CHITCHAT
Meant to stay inside all the time.	CHITCHAT
But the biggest selling point on Greyhounds was just how lazy they are.	CHITCHAT
And I don't know if it's it's so interesting to hear that you know that you knew that moves 'cause typically it's the other way around.	CHITCHAT
People.	CHITCHAT
People tend to think that there are no 'cause there a race dog.	CHITCHAT
A dog that's.	CHITCHAT
Biologically intended to run fast that there are a hyperactive dog.	CHITCHAT
Couldn't be.	CHITCHAT
More incorrect, I'm saying that right?	CHITCHAT
They have such a small.	CHITCHAT
Tank, you know, like in terms of fuel?	CHITCHAT
That it doesn't take them.	CHITCHAT
That long to be absolutely exhausted.	CHITCHAT
And they can.	CHITCHAT
They can be fairly not the smartest dog like they can be smart.	CHITCHAT
Oh, he's not.	CHITCHAT
He's definitely.	CHITCHAT
He's definitely not the smartest dog.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But I love a man.	CHITCHAT
He's not much for like personality.	CHITCHAT
He only really gets excited, and even then he'll just like kind of jump.	CHITCHAT
Once or twice like that off his front legs.	CHITCHAT
When it comes to being fed.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
I love him now, he's fantastic.	CHITCHAT
I couldn't have asked for better.	CHITCHAT
Dog, then I'll be.	CHITCHAT
Like I shouldn't say I shouldn't say he's dumb, he's just like.	CHITCHAT

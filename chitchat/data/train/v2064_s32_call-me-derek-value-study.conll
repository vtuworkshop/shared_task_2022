He's super chill.	CHITCHAT
He's very, very good boy.	CHITCHAT
Training him was very easy.	CHITCHAT
I kiss feels strange over here.	CHITCHAT
Huh?	CHITCHAT
I missed Marcel leaving myself.	CHITCHAT
You can hear this.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate you hanging out dude.	CHITCHAT
I'll talk to you very soon, man.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I hear you most.	CHITCHAT
2nd generation adopted for any Cyborg related stuff.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, that's probably a wise decision.	CHITCHAT
Man, anything that crosses the.	CHITCHAT
You know the bridges from.	CHITCHAT
Exclusively.	CHITCHAT
Technology based, you know, hardware is exterior.	CHITCHAT
Outside of biological.	CHITCHAT
Entity.	CHITCHAT
I will.	CHITCHAT
I will not be jumping or first in line.	CHITCHAT
I would not.	CHITCHAT
I will not be first in line.	CHITCHAT
Communicating so difficult today will not be personalized to.	CHITCHAT
Get that stuff put into my brain or wherever it goes.	CHITCHAT
But I will be.	CHITCHAT
Very very interested in seeing.	CHITCHAT
How it progresses?	CHITCHAT
So maybe I can eventually sign myself up, right?	CHITCHAT
I don't know if there's a lot of controversy with that.	CHITCHAT
You know the day when are we have our phones right?	CHITCHAT
Which is basically.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like a.	CHITCHAT
The closest thing that we have right now to neural networking, right?	CHITCHAT
'cause it's in our hands.	CHITCHAT
Their eyes to look at it, you know.	CHITCHAT
The next step is when her phone is actually in our brain.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if we're going to go to glasses.	CHITCHAT
Do you guys think that we'll see?	CHITCHAT
A rise in popularity with like.	CHITCHAT
Like Google Glass.	CHITCHAT
Do you think that will happen?	CHITCHAT
I think we'll see in like.	CHITCHAT
In a, uh, what would you call that industry, just like consumerism?	CHITCHAT
You know, like at restaurants and.	CHITCHAT
You know, displays for ordering your food and items and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I think we'll see basically giant tablets, and that's still not necessarily neuro.	CHITCHAT
Technology but.	CHITCHAT
What I was really saying is.	CHITCHAT
Google Glass, right?	CHITCHAT
Like I don't think we'll have any kind of visors that we look through.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you know what?	CHITCHAT
Maybe an inner cars?	CHITCHAT
'cause I think that's already available, right?	CHITCHAT
That's some cars have that like.	CHITCHAT
Like they have, this heads up display.	CHITCHAT
They have this HUD.	CHITCHAT
That displays on your.	CHITCHAT
Windshield right?	CHITCHAT
I think that's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
List the least invasive kind of means of.	CHITCHAT
Still still having your phone available to write while driving.	CHITCHAT
When we talk about.	CHITCHAT
Jeez.	CHITCHAT
And the drop.	CHITCHAT
'cause people found them creepy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I totally can get that.	CHITCHAT
They are there so weird man.	CHITCHAT
The prototype things whatever.	CHITCHAT
So strange.	CHITCHAT
I think as long as there are built into, maybe that's what they're waiting for to.	CHITCHAT
Better the hardware, right?	CHITCHAT
To make the hardware a little bit more streamlined in.	CHITCHAT
This is going to be creepy as well, concealable.	CHITCHAT
Into regular glasses.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
'cause If you have regular glasses on then that's not in terms of society.	CHITCHAT
That's not a hard.	CHITCHAT

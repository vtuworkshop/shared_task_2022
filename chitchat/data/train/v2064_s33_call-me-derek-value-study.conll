It's not a harder.	CHITCHAT
That's easy.	CHITCHAT
Leap for us to make.	CHITCHAT
'cause we're already familiar with people wearing glasses.	CHITCHAT
But making them look like they're from like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Science fiction show or movie?	CHITCHAT
Don't know.	CHITCHAT
I guess you can kind of say the same for like phones, but we've always really had.	CHITCHAT
Let me say like newspaper.	CHITCHAT
Newspaper too.	CHITCHAT
I guess the closest thing from that would be like a pager and I got the Palm pilot type of thing.	CHITCHAT
You know when when Palm is out there called?	CHITCHAT
And then after that it was like.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
What they called the raspberries blue plant, Blackberries recalled blackberries.	CHITCHAT
And then from Blackberries.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Smart phones became more of A.	CHITCHAT
Thing iPhone and Android devices.	CHITCHAT
And now, like, what's the next thing though?	CHITCHAT
Are we going?	CHITCHAT
Are we going to make that jump right to neural networking the neuroscience?	CHITCHAT
I know that there's some scientists that have already been able to do it.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know if we're at the.	CHITCHAT
At the stage where we can kind of just hand that out to consumers, right?	CHITCHAT
Why is he talking about this?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I do not know.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know what accent that was.	CHITCHAT
They had a video camera built into them, which was the biggest problem.	CHITCHAT
If I recall, yeah, I could totally see that.	CHITCHAT
I mean like it's strange.	CHITCHAT
It's strange.	CHITCHAT
The difference between a device being held in our hands and one.	CHITCHAT
That's on her head handless, right?	CHITCHAT
Handheld Device over a.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Handless device glasses.	CHITCHAT
The difference of how creepy one can be.	CHITCHAT
I mean it totally get it.	CHITCHAT
It is creepy.	CHITCHAT
It's so weird.	CHITCHAT
And I don't even know if we're used to.	CHITCHAT
Maybe some of us are maybe people who see it more often but.	CHITCHAT
I definitely don't see well.	CHITCHAT
I don't go outside to experience the world anyways.	CHITCHAT
I guess none of us do now, right?	CHITCHAT
Sorry to remind you, but people talking to themselves.	CHITCHAT
Out in public, just walking around right, just like.	CHITCHAT
That's still to me.	CHITCHAT
I find it very bizarre.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I tend to if I ever do, which is so rare, extremely rare thing if I'm ever talking on my phone in public, I'll probably use.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably hold it to my head, or at the very least.	CHITCHAT
If it's on speaker mode, I'll hold it up like this, right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I don't know, it's just weird to handheld or the hand lists.	CHITCHAT
Option in being in public and.	CHITCHAT
I guess it's just simply because I'm not used to seeing that.	CHITCHAT
I think that would be different again if I was.	CHITCHAT
Experiencing it on a date on a daily basis.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no, this this is project me.	CHITCHAT
It's probably just may not.	CHITCHAT
Not leaving my house again.	CHITCHAT
Overtime, OK, we actually only have 10 minutes, which I think will be able to finish this.	CHITCHAT
I could probably say it's done now.	CHITCHAT
The likeness isn't really.	CHITCHAT
You know, I guess somebody would be like hey, that kind of looks like Abe Lincoln.	CHITCHAT
I'd like, yeah, that's kind of him.	CHITCHAT
And then I only lose a little bit of sleep from that, you know, just.	CHITCHAT
Just put that sadness deep down inside rain X.	CHITCHAT
All the other sadness and disappointment I have for my own artwork.	CHITCHAT
Oh Yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Never know if there are crazy right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and that's kind of it, right?	CHITCHAT
And I think it's simply the thought.	CHITCHAT
The thing that stopped me from just going handless is.	CHITCHAT
Imagine seeing myself in this or somebody else in my in that position and let me call it kind of seems a little bit weird, so I'm just going to.	CHITCHAT

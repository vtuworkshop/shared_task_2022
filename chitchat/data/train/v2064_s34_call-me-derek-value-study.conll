It's not hold my phone.	CHITCHAT
Then again, I'm the type of person that thinks.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of rude to be in a public area and on your phone on your phone at the same time, but that's me.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of just meet.	CHITCHAT
I think that I'd probably end up just looking for less populated area and just try and talk somewhere is right for a little bit.	CHITCHAT
You know someone is like a movie theater.	CHITCHAT
That's probably where I'd go.	CHITCHAT
You know it's right in the middle of everybody.	CHITCHAT
Just talk, there's a lot of.	CHITCHAT
I deem necessary.	CHITCHAT
You know, right?	CHITCHAT
Right as.	CHITCHAT
The movies.	CHITCHAT
Playing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you know, I could probably spend probably another.	CHITCHAT
30 minutes on this and.	CHITCHAT
Push some other areas.	O
And keep rendering others and fixing.	O
Things and correcting other things and stuff in words, but I think they will probably just call it here.	O
I just called the study done.	CHITCHAT
Like it kind of, yeah, I would definitely like to spend a little bit more time down here.	O
In this area.	O
Trying to get this looking a little bit better.	O
All of this area.	O
Folder.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Well folks.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to call it here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to do some more studies.	CHITCHAT
Next week here in the channel on Behance.	CHITCHAT
Uh, not sure, but it's going to be.	CHITCHAT
Yet I think will stick with heads for a little bit and keep studying on those guys.	O
That's something that I've always been can use a little bit more time.	O
I can use who my kidding I studying anything.	CHITCHAT
Uh, it's beneficial.	CHITCHAT
There's no, there's no time like yeah, no I'm completely done working on heads I've just never need to draw another one.	CHITCHAT
Never need to work on another face or head ever again.	CHITCHAT
We're good.	CHITCHAT
Mark that off the list.	CHITCHAT
That's not that's not a thing that happens.	CHITCHAT
So maybe we'll find some random photos online.	CHITCHAT
And do some studies.	CHITCHAT
Of human heads, real life human heads.	CHITCHAT
Of photos of human heads that are alive.	CHITCHAT
It sounds really more with when I just say human heads.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and I also got to say it's an absolute delight to be back.	CHITCHAT
In one way or another, streaming.	CHITCHAT
I look forward to.	CHITCHAT
Getting to a place where I can do this.	CHITCHAT
Full time again.	CHITCHAT
And hang out with you guys on the daily and just kind of chill and make stupid jokes both here and on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
How many heads or how many gesture landscapes, etc.	CHITCHAT
It depends on what do you want to improve on.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I guess you could definitely say that it is subjective, right?	CHITCHAT
It's relative.	CHITCHAT
How far do you want to put your abilities?	CHITCHAT
To me, there's just never an end insight, so it's just forward.	CHITCHAT
Let's keep doing more right?	CHITCHAT
But that's something that's good to bring up.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I'll see you guys next Thursday, so I stream here.	CHITCHAT

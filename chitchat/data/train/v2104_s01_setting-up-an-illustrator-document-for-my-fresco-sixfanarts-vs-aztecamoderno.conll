Then I stop.	O
And so I want to back up my work.	O
I don't want to.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to just rely on fresco to save my work and keep it in the cloud.	O
I'm going to go ahead and export as a PDF and this where I put the PDS right here.	O
This is the folder where I put all the frame lapses 'cause Adobe fresco records video of the work that you're doing, and then here.	O
Let's see the screenshots.	O
I take lots of Screenshots as I'm working because this then becomes the content that I share.	O
An Instagram, Facebook, Twitter an on Behance also.	O
Then the last thing is this, the illustrator file.	O
So here's an illustrator file of the design and let me see if he shows up here.	O
It does not show up in here.	O
Hopefully that is a good.	CHITCHAT
Let me see where we 'cause I finish.	CHITCHAT
I stick out more than I don't know.	CHITCHAT
And that's #16.	O
So that's 422 at 12:40.	O
That's 418, so that's a earlier version, so let's go ahead and jump in.	O
So so I keep I try to keep my files organized.	O
It's always important to organize your files so that you know what you're looking for and where to find it.	O
So from fresco, I export as a PDF, and now I'm going to open this PDF in illustrator.	O
So let's go ahead illustrator.	O
I guess I ever it is.	CHITCHAT
It's working boom.	CHITCHAT
There it is.	CHITCHAT
So this is what I've been working on.	O
And uh, Adobe fresco.	O
And I've been exporting every step of the way.	O
As you can see, I've exported a tonna copies of the same thing, but in various stages of completion.	O
So I'm done with that.	O
So now here is where I'm going to make adjustments and save a master file for where I'm gonna start bringing into acid God's little by little.	O
Even though we see the mall right here, there are different stages of completion, so this one.	O
You see, is flat colors, but this one has a lot of details already, and so when you're working on a file like this one with Adobe France, Cordova fresh school starts to run down really slow an, so I'm tired of sitting in front of fresco when I'm working and then it just runs through Sloan out the way and then of course I like talking so it's OK.	O
But at the same time I wish machine would move a little faster and that's going to happen with you on the iPad or the surface.	O
Because frescoes a mobile app that is designed to run lightly on a device, and, uh, it has mobile type of coding or something.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I understand.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kind of making it up as I go along, but I have a theory that because the mobile app it is not like illustrator or photo shop that has 30 years of code dropped into to handle heavy loads.	CHITCHAT
Alright.	CHITCHAT
So without that said, when I'm going to do is I'm going to go down.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
The the file and start cleaning it up.	O
Some of the things that I'm going to do is start splitting up some of these layers, so here we go.	O
Boom.	CHITCHAT
Look at this.	CHITCHAT
So whatever is happening here is going to be so.	CHITCHAT
This is one of the guys so that so she is down here.	O
Alright, and so when you bring in your files from fresco off a PDF, you're going to have clipping path.	O
This kind of just in the way and I don't like it.	O
I don't need it, there's nothing there to do.	O
But then there's the oops wrong, but there it is there is that that this goddess right here right?	CHITCHAT
And so inside of the name for this goddess, there's another clipping path.	O
Inside other goddess is outlined.	O
There's another clipping path, and so I'm going to grab these two.	O
Put him in a group.	O
I'll put it right here.	O
Boom, that's three.	O
So now this is becomes and I'm going to start organizing.	O
What's crazy is that.	CHITCHAT
Siwa cotton Is that as I work till the gods gonna stop bringing a man?	O
Some of these layers I'm going to end up deleting.	O
But I but I will organize right now so that when I do bring those guys, I have a good role.	O
Mapper was happening here in my file, so this all about clean up.	O
This about organizing is about staying on.	O
In a A Workflow That's going to be beneficial as time goes on.	O
So there she is.	O
Those are her lines, you know why?	O
Let's go like this.	O
And then these are the colors for the same goddess.	O
There we go grab that look.	O
I'm going to hold on, hold on shift, grab all of these and this is going to go right here, boom.	O
So then that name is going to be.	O
Siwa cotton Uh, colour.	O
Flats your colors, hair colors everyday is and I mean delete that layers to widen that even stay there.	O

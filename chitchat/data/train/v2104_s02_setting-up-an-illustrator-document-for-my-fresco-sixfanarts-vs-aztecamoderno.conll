I don't know boom so there it is.	CHITCHAT
So we got that see now that's done often on that's not done yet.	O
'cause we gotta clean up so inside of each of those groups is this clipping path.	O
So I gotta get rid of that.	O
Boom boom boom and it's a little tedious work.	CHITCHAT
I do not enjoy this.	CHITCHAT
I don't think anybody enjoys it but let me tell you something.	CHITCHAT
Later on, as you're getting closer to being done, or if it's a professional job and you need to pass it on to the client or to another illustrator designer, you will appreciate that you did all of this organizing and the front end what they call it.	CHITCHAT
Housekeeping, yes, is very important, so that's what I'm doing right now.	CHITCHAT
Bum bum bum, especially at night like tonight where I I I did not expect to go live and uh but I did reorganize my setup so well let me try to go like to test this but I'm going to do something that's Productive alright COO COO COO so there it is that's done all right.	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to go ahead and save as and this is where we're going into that illustrator file.	O
Adobe illustrator.	O
And now it's going to be called now, wow.	O

6 fan art.	O
There it is.	O
It's a six nominations.	O
So that's what I'm gonna call it.	O
Nations and then re one?	O
Alright, so this is the first illustrator file I'm gonna change it to illustrator so I've changed the name from the naming system that I started with fresco.	O
I change that name to some news naming system that I'm going to use when I'm working with illustrator because then that'll differentiate the level of completion of the files 'cause I'm going to still going to have more numbers when it comes to fresco files and I'm going to have more numbers when it comes to illustrator files.	O
But I'm no not just because the illustrator file, but I'll know because of the name that I am looking at.	O
A more complete, more organized file that's in illustrator.	O
So there it is, save it.	O
It's going to take a second.	O
Well, there goes OK.	O
Done so there we go.	O
We got a sewaddle so now let's see who's this year that is discussed the poker and I can tell because this is highlighted over here.	O

Get rid of it bone.	O
There it is.	O
Oh yes, I love it.	CHITCHAT
It's coming along I need room for some logos.	O
OK OK.	CHITCHAT
Control S.	O
It's a little tedious, but this is the work you have to do.	O
Alright, so let's fix this rest of the guys gonna make it easier.	O
OK, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Now where clipping mask by what God is this?	O
Cheap it'll take.	CHITCHAT
Got that.	O
I know, yeah, this.	CHITCHAT
Boom, got that done.	CHITCHAT
So these are also let's go here.	O
Yes, just making you layers and then bam.	O
Set love it.	CHITCHAT
OKOKOK next, this is all the solid, uh, the flag colors.	O
Some highlights the greens.	O
The Blues, you see how I I use each layer 4 one color only.	O
That makes changing the colors easy.	O
And when you pass on this this file to the next artist, the next illustrator your client then I have to dig around looking for stuff.	O
Then I have to try to tap it on the screen.	O
They just got through your layers.	O
That's what the layers are for.	O
Use your layers.	O
I will forever quote friend of mine.	CHITCHAT
His name is a mexi funk on Instagram and Twitter.	CHITCHAT
He said layers are free.	CHITCHAT
That means you can use many as you want.	CHITCHAT
Adobe is not gonna charge you for anymore of those, something that's what you meant.	O
I'm just saying the point is that there's no reason for you to not use the layers to your advantage.	O
Does the colors look at bam colors?	CHITCHAT
OK, she better	CHITCHAT
Colors every task as you see, name, name and title of what's happening in that layer.	O
Bomb gun control is to save it.	CHITCHAT

So now this guy who is this person.	CHITCHAT
Alright, 'cause I got.	CHITCHAT
It's a very simple process.	O
I need to ask the be Hanstein why this happens.	CHITCHAT
I know it has to do with a mobile app type stuff that PDF cannot support.	O
The vectors that come out of Adobe fresco.	O
I'm I'm just making this up.	O
Um, so the way, yeah.	CHITCHAT
The way a PDF keeps vectors alive, it brings a clipping mask with it.	O
That's that's what I'm guessing.	O
Which is fine, but I mean because this is vector.	O
This is what I want.	O
See that those are vector points.	O
Do you see that?	CHITCHAT
This is my little bit OK.	O
Okay, controlling anchor points yes.	O
Yes yes yes, come on.	CHITCHAT

And so, so when you draw, you know with a marker you like you're trying to be careful.	CHITCHAT
You trying to get that deadline just right.	CHITCHAT
You know, get that curve just right.	CHITCHAT
That's why there's so many tools that one just match boom, and you know when it comes to graphic design and illustration, there's so many tools, traditional tools.	CHITCHAT

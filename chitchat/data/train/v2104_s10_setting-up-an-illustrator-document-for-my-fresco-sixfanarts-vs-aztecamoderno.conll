Because you'll get through a drawing hours later and then you do have one mess up like one time is like oh like no now you gotta do the drawing all over again or you gotta use white out or have other techniques you know.	CHITCHAT
And if you look at the old comic books.	CHITCHAT
Comic book drawings.	CHITCHAT
You know, they'll they'll have copy and paste, like to cut out a piece of paper pasted on top of the drawing, and then re draw a particular piece of the drawing and stuff.	CHITCHAT
And so you know I was in a front that age, but it is.	CHITCHAT
It is very frustrating to work on something and then you don't get it right, like there's something that's just not right.	CHITCHAT
And the only way to fix it is to draw it again.	CHITCHAT
So you know 20 years ago people like Hey Dan, you need to try out some illustrator like man illustrator, my real artist.	CHITCHAT

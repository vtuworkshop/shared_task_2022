OK, that's very high, yeah.	O
Now you just looking for the right combination who that was at 3%, that's crazy.	O
Oh wait, I guess that went the wrong way.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
Reminder.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, that's that one.	CHITCHAT
OK, yeah.	CHITCHAT
13 'cause if I turn it off.	O
I can still see.	O
Oh this, which one is which?	CHITCHAT
This one.	CHITCHAT
I got lost too much clicking.	CHITCHAT
Let me see, this is the solid.	O
Turn it off.	O
Turn this one on.	O
This is the gradient.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Right, and if I turn this off.	O
The green is not enough.	O
That's because all I get it.	O
It's all one solid piece an I don't want that it's not working.	O
Some parts are working like you see right here.	O
There's a gradient and then, uh, you know it's a lot of gradients all over here, which is which is right.	O
Which is why I was turning down the opacity, looking for little right.	O
Uh, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Looking for the right.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, see that that's real neat, but the problem is.	O
That this piece is one.	O
Oh yeah, there we go like this.	O
Right there, that's one big piece, so you're not going to see the gradients.	O
Which is fine because I got skills.	O
Damn you see this right here on site.	O
The eraser has roommates.	O
One of the roommates is called a knife.	O
You get that knife and then you go like this.	O
Mam.	O
Then you don't like this.	O
Then you go like this.	O
Bang.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, cut through.	CHITCHAT
You have to cut through.	O
Bing.	O
There you go.	O
That's it.	O
Oh, that's not it.	O
One of my pieces there.	O
Bang.	CHITCHAT
So now look nice, little gradients, whereas before you couldn't.	O
Alright, Here we go.	O
This is another piece.	O
Then he's cutting.	O
That's why illustrator, it's amazing.	O
Fancy too many different 'cause of the gradient goes that way.	O
So it's all good.	O
You know, sometimes you gotta grab some of them.	O
It's not gonna work, so let's go ahead, turn that back up so.	O
Not there right there.	O
Yeah, give me some give me some shadows, see that yes yes.	O
Yes, there we go cut it.	O
Dumb.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Credit up Let's go ahead and cut through here.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Being a little random 'cause I wanna see a lot of different tones.	O

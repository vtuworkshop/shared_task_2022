You got me today Ryan and uh, in an off day where I'm just taking my time to organize this artwork in illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Because fresco is having a hard time keeping up.	CHITCHAT
So I'm gonna have to delete some layers in Frisco to free up some of the space and.	O
And then so if I get my document just ready, have my layouts my layers together.	O
Organized in the illustrator file.	O
Then I can get rid of some things in the Frisco file and not have to worry about it.	O
However, I do have several copies of the same file in fresco in the creative cloud save because I like saving over and over and over again case something bad happens.	O
So there we go, dragon along.	CHITCHAT

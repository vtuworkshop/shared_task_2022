Delete layer.	O
Delete layer.	O
And I just thought about that.	CHITCHAT
I make a copy of this.	O
Yeah, I did.	CHITCHAT
Actually before I I closed up last night delete layer.	O
See that's it.	O
Delete layer bang, that's gone.	O
That's it.	O
So now that freed up a ton of layers in Frisco, and I'll have to think about it as a matter of fact, I'm gonna delete a ton of this stuff, delete layer, delete layer, there you go.	O
So now it's just really.	CHITCHAT
I'm back tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
Alejandro yes, tomorrow 8:00 o'clock.	CHITCHAT
I I gotta, I gotta get back on the detail inside a fresco that's it, son.	O
And since I already got my colors and another uh in illustrator, now I can actually flatten these out into one layer.	O
Merge layers in a group.	O
Merge layers in the group.	O
Merge layers in a group.	O
I can merge these layers in a group.	O
Uh-huh Yeah, that I went from like 50 layers to 10.	O
And that is going to help my fresco.	O
Alright, there it is.	O
So housekeeping today.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Oh I love it.	CHITCHAT
So that's 123456789 ten 1112 layers.	O
I said now it's gonna be much faster at when I'm drawing it will react.	O
As a matter fact, let's go ahead and get rid of this car.	O
Leave him there.	O
Uh-huh That's it now, so there's a way to change the name in here, but I don't think it actually works sometimes.	O
Let me see this is gonna be #17 save it.	O
Yeah it does OK and then take it to the house.	O
Thank you design Castle.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate that yes Ryan.	CHITCHAT
51 megabytes is tiny but I don't know man and you know there is 17 OK so just change name from 16 to 17 but the 15 is the same as 17 so I'm OK.	O
Is a very exact saying this was this is the other like this one has all the layers still this one I flattened out a lot of things and I think I'm part of the part of the reason around.	O
Slow is not just fresco is that I'm running over yes and it's a 16 megabyte surface assistant GB ram ram.	O
16 gigabytes of ram on the surface, and so it should run smoothly, but it are.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why it.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I think it's just too much.	CHITCHAT
Two things going on, same time that it starts to run slow.	CHITCHAT
There's so many things so many layers in this document.	O
This time starts to run real slow, so I got a whole different solution that I'm working with right now.	O
I have a surface connected system, teak, that's all that's going out to a different computer that's then.	O
Using OBS to go out to the Internet so woo stuff work, but I'm making it happen alright.	CHITCHAT
Thank you everybody for being here.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate all the thumbs up.	CHITCHAT
I think this is the most thumbs up so I ever had in this whole series of streams.	CHITCHAT
When I come back tomorrow at eight o'clock I'm jumping right back into fresco.	CHITCHAT
Into this file right here and say look that much faster.	O
See how fast it came back up.	O
Near with all these layers?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I'm gonna dance.	CHITCHAT
Start doing the details and all these other gods and I think I should.	CHITCHAT
I should take maybe 1 hour for each God.	CHITCHAT
That's my goal.	CHITCHAT

Hey everybody.	O
Hey yet.	O
Hey let me know if you can hear me.	O
I'm using a new microphone.	O
So I want to know if you all can hear.	O
My voice.	O
Or if I'm going to be streaming in silence.	O
Can you hear me out there?	O
Hello, let me know when the chat if you can hear me give me a little little note.	O
Just to let me know if my voice is coming through.	O
Alright cool, thank you.	O
Just checking Um, already so character designer was the clear winner for this.	O
Character designs using was the clear winner for this stream, so I'm going to be doing some character design.	O
And.	O
I wanted to start with these shapes that are very different from one another.	O
One that's sort of a long skinny shape.	O
When this sort of more of a skwat kind of egg shape and then take these.	O
In two different directions.	O
Um?	O
I grew up.	O
A lot of my time growing up was spent in the 80s where.	O
Skateboarding really took off.	O
And I thought it be fun to do.	O
A couple of character designs of sort of like the kids I remember.	O
Um?	O
From that time.	O
When skating was really taking off, so.	O
What I want to do is this tall skinny kid with long hair.	O
And then this shorter kind of squad more.	O
Stubby kid And then just have them standing next to each other.	O
Um?	O
And just work these out for you and do it quickly because this is a fast exercise.	O
Not going to spend too much time, but.	O
While I'm doing it, feel free to ask me any questions you might have right now.	O
What I'm trying to figure out for this tall guy here is like how much real estate too, a lot for.	O
Play the head up here.	O
And then the torso he ran then.	O
Working out how long the legs are OK and giving them a different sort of angle from one another so.	O
They're kind of interesting trying to get this sort of a flow.	O
To him and I now feel like I'd like to kind of tilts his head this way so.	O
It changed that up.	O
We have some new erasers here in Frisco.	O
I'm going to use the rubber eraser.	O
Really like it.	O
Make a little smaller.	O
And just erase away there.	O
Change the shape.	O
So we're going to have this kind of S curve to him where it's like doing this OK.	O
That's the general idea is so really I'll just throw that in there faintly as a line of action.	O
I think this guy is kind of like pretty much right now, straight up and down.	O
But I might have him lean.	O
This way.	O
To compliment this guy.	O
So if this guys kind of got his head cocked up this way.	O
Maybe this guy will have his head.	O
More sort of like a block.	O
Pushing in this way into his body.	O
Might have in turn is not even turn him a little bit.	O
Actually, now that I think of it, I might actually have his.	O
One arm.	O
Here when shoulder here.	O
Holding his board.	O
They have a skateboard right there?	O
Have him holding that board right there.	O
And then have.	O
Him turning sideways.	O

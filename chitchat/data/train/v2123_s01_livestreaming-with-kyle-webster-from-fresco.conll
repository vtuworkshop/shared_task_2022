So that we get some contrast.	O
So that both facing us directly right?	O
But I can turn his head and have him still kind of mostly looking at us, like maybe more three quarter of you kind of thing.	O
Alright, and now we have these funny little legs sticking out of these big baggy shorts.	O
Alright, so not to get too much detail here, but just trying to workout his shape there.	O
I think that feels pretty good.	CHITCHAT
So there's that arm is going to have a big.	O
Arm right here.	O
Grabbing the skate deck.	O
Or actually maybe grab him by the trucks there trucks of the board have it angled out this way.	O
In front.	O
Trucks, wheels, wheels right so that guys I feel pretty good about that set of shapes right there might.	O
I'll come back and refine a little bit what happens up here at the top, but that's pretty much it.	O
So you got shape out here out here.	O
Shorts are more like a blocky sort of a rectangle thing happening down here and then.	O
These funny little legs just coming down.	O
This one needs to be pushed out here.	O
You can use that eraser again.	O
Maybe that board needs to slide out the back more so I can.	O
Make those adjustments.	O
Uh, Yes, you're asking what brush am I using?	O
This is just the default pencil.	O
In Frisco.	O
And it's a beauty.	CHITCHAT
Love it.	CHITCHAT
It's really easy to use.	O
Feels like a pencil.	O
And I like doing this sort of blue pencil line, which is like the Cola race.	O
Non photo blue.	O
Pencil's.	O
Love those.	CHITCHAT
Still got a few hang around the house I gave one to my son.	CHITCHAT
He's been drawing with it likes it.	CHITCHAT
They just they just going to draw with, right?	CHITCHAT
You haven't tried him.	CHITCHAT
Get yourself one.	CHITCHAT
Or just drawn Frisco and make the color blue.	CHITCHAT
Right, so I'll pop this foot facing forward.	O
Facing us directly.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So he's pretty much worked out.	O
I haven't gotten to figure out what his head looks like.	O
That's fine, I'm just getting the general body shape here.	O
Shrink this down a little bit.	O
And take this guy here now and want to work work on him for a bit.	O
So I want it said to belong.	O
And I want to be like a triangle with the.	O
With the hair long hair in fact, what I'd like to do is cover up.	O
Maybe his eyes completely and just have this.	O
His nose sticking out.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Will just cover up his.	O
Face with his hair.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And I'll have him hang.	O
Holding is bored out here to the other side.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
He's going to have long, skinny arms.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Baggy shirt When I was a kid and people were into skating and stuff, they.	O
They all had baggy clothing.	CHITCHAT
Big, baggy clothing.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that's still the case.	CHITCHAT
I'm not obviously.	CHITCHAT
Part of the end of that scene anymore, so maybe somebody can let me know.	CHITCHAT
In the chat.	CHITCHAT
And we're going to give him some jeans.	O
So we can play up those skinny legs sticking out of those.	O
Sticking out of the big shirt there.	O
Make a really skinny.	O
Even skinnier than this.	O
This is just a character, right?	CHITCHAT
You can really go nuts.	O
You don't have to worry bout obviously the anatomy being.	O
Correct, that isn't the point here, is it?	O
Can be wearing some vans or some air walks.	O
Anne will get him holding on to that board.	O
Right there.	O
And get some wheels back there.	O

Rubber eraser, fantastic.	O
Really pressure sensitive.	O
Little texture built in.	O

Just cleaning it up.	O
Cleaning it up.	O
It's fun when you look at sketches though to see those all those marks that you put in there to figure things out.	O
I like to see that I'd like to see little evidence of the process that an artist has gone through.	CHITCHAT
I especially like if you go and see why.	CHITCHAT
I sure hope we can go into museums again someday soon, right?	CHITCHAT
Holy cow, it's it's tough not being able to go anywhere and stay home all the time.	CHITCHAT
But when you go into a museum and they have those drawings, I love seeing the drawings where you can see all the evidence of what the.	CHITCHAT
Artists.	CHITCHAT
Did on the page before they arrived at.	CHITCHAT
You know their final, their final drawing, right?	CHITCHAT

And that is for clipping masks.	O
So that is coming very soon.	O
Alright, I'm already testing it right now.	O
It's all looking good, so yeah, got good news for you there.	O
That's on the way.	O
Hope that answers your question.	CHITCHAT
Clipping masks on the way.	O
Alright, so I'm just kind of going to refine this guy a little bit here.	O
I wanted to give him this.	O
Big.	O
Highs of the heavy brow line like this.	O
There.	O
Maybe he's a?	CHITCHAT
Eyebrows can be kind of chunky there at the edges.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
I like that his head just kind of connects to his body.	O
There's really not much of a neck to speak up there.	O
That's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Now I'm thinking of.	CHITCHAT
What to do like?	CHITCHAT
Using Line to sort of.	O
Define this hair a little bit better and this is nice.	O
You can do these kind of WAVY shapes up and then at the top I can just kind of.	O
Curl them out.	O
That's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
And I just come a little more clearly with that.	O
Line straight down here and then out.	O
Is going to have this balled up?	O
Hand.	O
Gripping those.	O
Trucks For the scape word there.	O
I wonder if it be funnier if his arm coming out of the sleeve just try this for a second.	O
I love that you can try stuff and then undo it, right?	CHITCHAT
Just make that big balled up fist and then one of his arm coming out of out of the shirt is like kind of really thin.	O
Even those get this big baggy shirt and this round body.	O
Right, suggesting that he's got some help to him, right?	O
But then the sleeve is really excuse me, their arm coming out.	O
It's really thin.	O
I can't decide which is better than the more cartoony you go you can do stuff like that.	O
Hi Brigitte, he said which hardware?	CHITCHAT
Oh this is.	CHITCHAT
I'm on the iPad with Adobe fresco.	O
Fresco is a free app.	O
So if you have an iPad, just download it.	O
Simple as that.	O
Pretty great deal, although we did just announce yesterday which is pretty cool that.	CHITCHAT
Fresco is now bundled.	O
With photo shop.	O
If you get Photoshop for the iPad.	O
You also get the full.	O
Fresco Full version of fresco.	O
The only difference between it and the free version is storage space and then access to all of your own custom brushes that you can import.	O
And all the custom brushes that I made that are available in the Adobe Photoshop brush librarians over now.	O
There are over 1800 brushes in that library so.	O
You have access to all that stuff, all your color.	O
Libraries another.	O
Assets and.	O
Assets you've made in capture and whatnot.	O
Things like that, but the bundle is 10 bucks a month for photo shop an frescoes that's nice.	O
Alright, What do you guys think is the is the arm funnier?	CHITCHAT
If it's if it's smaller, I'm going to leave it like that for now please go back and change it.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Just kind of now I'm just doing some refinement right of what's already on the on the page.	O
And if you want we could, we could move on.	O
We could just do a quick.	CHITCHAT
Drawing of another character, since we already got these pretty well figured out, or I could continue to refine these.	O
Just draw over what's here and get it a little tighter.	O
And this is the same process I use for everything I sketch.	CHITCHAT
And then I moved from the sketch too.	CHITCHAT
Something a little tighter simple.	CHITCHAT
But really, I think people put too much pressure on themselves.	CHITCHAT
They try and nail a drawing.	CHITCHAT
Right from the gecko.	CHITCHAT
Instead of giving themselves that time, they need.	CHITCHAT

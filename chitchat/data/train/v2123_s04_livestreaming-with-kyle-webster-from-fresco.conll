To sketch it out.	CHITCHAT
And figure out the big shapes and workout their compositions and all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
You gotta give yourself that space.	CHITCHAT
That room to experiment to mess up to.	CHITCHAT
Just figure things out and if there's no pressure and there is no pressure in that stage that sketch stage.	CHITCHAT
That's where you do that stuff.	CHITCHAT
You know you had a really.	CHITCHAT
Free yourself up to just play around.	CHITCHAT
Early on.	CHITCHAT
If you start so tight you know where you're like.	CHITCHAT
Oh man, every line is precious, every line matters.	CHITCHAT
Every line counts.	CHITCHAT
That's just putting way too much pressure on yourself.	CHITCHAT
And also what you wind up doing is committing way too early to stuff that frankly maybe isn't that good, right?	CHITCHAT
Maybe there are better decisions to be made, but suddenly you find yourself saying, well, I've already gone this far and I started rendering that knows or I started drawing that I and.	CHITCHAT
Well, I can't go back now, right?	CHITCHAT
But I'm here to tell you that that is just going to set you up for.	CHITCHAT
A miserable experience drawing right.	CHITCHAT
It's too much pressure.	CHITCHAT
Start simple, start with big shapes.	CHITCHAT
Don't put all that pressure on yourself.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Sketch, you know, figure it out sketching.	CHITCHAT
It'll it'll workout, it'll happen.	CHITCHAT
But you're not going to have to feel like, Oh my gosh, I just gotta nail this.	CHITCHAT
Right out of the gate, right?	CHITCHAT
That's just.	CHITCHAT
Who too much pressure OK?	CHITCHAT
All Right, This is coming together nicely.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I like the contrast between these two dudes.	O
Very different looking guys, right?	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
That's fine.	O
Big soles, gotta give him those fat soles as Airwalk souls or vans or whatever they are wearing right?	O
Those get shredded on that grip tape every time you Ali.	O
Does it say here?	CHITCHAT
Do you have any suggestions for your favorite brushes for sketching and refining?	CHITCHAT
Oh, you downloaded them great.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, in the Mega Pack in the drawing box just sketch with the till terrific brush if you're in photo shop.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
That'll that'll do you write.	CHITCHAT
Try that one, and if you don't like it, try the perfect pencil.	O
Also in the drawing box in the Mega Pack.	O
That's another really nice one for sketching.	O
Um few people I know.	O
They really swear by the HP pro.	O
Brushes there are three of those.	O
Different sizes.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Anna leaving out a favorite of many people, which I should always remember to include.	O
And that's the animator pencil.	O
The animator pencil.	CHITCHAT
There are two versions of that.	O
It believed in the Mega Pack as well.	O
And they will serve you well.	O
Both the animator pencil and the till.	O
Terrific pencil allow you to do things like the default pencil in Frisco, which is to make fine lines and then also to shade with the side of the pencil.	O
OK, which is really nice just by tilting it.	O
Alright, this guy on the right feels good.	O
I'm going to leave that skinny arm.	O
I think that's funny.	CHITCHAT
Um kind of tempted to pop another.	O
Arm out here.	O
Having throw out some Devils horns, I don't know why.	O
I just feel like that's what he should be doing so.	O
There we go, so one.	O
She's three and four a, so I have to count out loud.	O
Remember how many fingers I'm drawing who fit said?	CHITCHAT
What can I tell you?	CHITCHAT
That's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
What the heck?	CHITCHAT
Let's leave that in there for now.	O
Can we change your mind right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
All right, pop that year out a little bit more.	O
Connect to the face, get some lines there.	O
And erase away a little bit of that mess right there.	O
Looks like pencil doesn't.	O
It's crazy.	CHITCHAT
I love how.	CHITCHAT
Natural.	CHITCHAT
These tools feel you know this is the thing about digital is what's your goal?	CHITCHAT
I mean something for everybody is different.	CHITCHAT
Some people want to recreate the feeling of working with natural media.	CHITCHAT
Some people don't care about that at all.	CHITCHAT

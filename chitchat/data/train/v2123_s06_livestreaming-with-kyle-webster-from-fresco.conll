But listen, it's easy to do right, just.	O
Erase away some of this mess.	O
I can see enough there.	O
Screeching Weasel is that what it was?	O
It was.	O
Hey, I don't know he you help me out there that 'cause I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I need to look it up, thanks.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's what it was.	CHITCHAT
All right, get that other.	O
We'll talk back there.	O
At the trucks there.	O
Got the board race away.	O
Some of this stuff that isn't quite accurate.	O
Light and all that up.	O
This is exactly how I would work with pencil.	O
By the way, is I would draw, take my kneaded eraser, a rubber eraser and just.	O
Light and stuff up, and when I'm teaching portraiture class or life drawing classes, I'm always telling people hey, give yourself a ghost, you know, Draw Something on the page and then erase it, but don't erase it all the way so you can see a little something there on the page it tells you where to go next.	O
If you raise totally to white.	O
You got no information to playoff of you have no idea if you want to move something a little bit to the right.	O
Can't see anything there anymore, right?	O
You need to be able to see what you've got on the page so that you can then.	O
Make decisions based on that information that you're seeing as opposed to just staring at something that's white that's just not going to help you, or whatever color paper working on the blank paper.	O
Is not really that helpful.	O
OK?	CHITCHAT
Get get some information down.	O
Get some lines on the page.	O
Then make a decision.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Quick quick thing to point out.	CHITCHAT
That I'm sure many of you know, but I think it's always worth mentioning when you think about perspective.	CHITCHAT
So these trucks are heading back this way.	O
I want to make sure these trucks.	O
Are going to meet.	O
Eventually with this line OK, way way off my page, these are going to converge to a single vanishing point even with something as cartoony, is what I'm drawing right now.	O
I still think about that kind of stuff when I'm drawing.	CHITCHAT
And you should too.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it adds to the believability.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe that's the wrong word.	CHITCHAT
It just makes a drawing look better if I could.	CHITCHAT
Simplify it down.	CHITCHAT
To the essence of why it's important, it makes it.	CHITCHAT
Look better makes the drawing work OK.	CHITCHAT
Those things matter.	CHITCHAT
So it's like same here.	CHITCHAT
If you look at this guys trucks where I drew this one kind of moving away this way this one even way.	O
That way they are not totally parallel.	O
OK, they're close, but not perfectly parallel.	O
And that's because they're going to eventually meet up in another banishing point off there on the horizon.	O
So think about that stuff.	O
Think about the rules of perspective, even when you are doing something cartoony.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Is more of those chains.	O
Wallet chain or whatever.	O
Gotta go back.	O
Up into the pocket.	O
I should probably redesign that shape doesn't work.	O
Do that again here.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Getting some jeans there OK?	O
It's good to have that wallet up there somewhere and then chain is going to come down and around.	O
There we go.	O
Kay?	CHITCHAT
Get too busy over there by the board.	O
Throw in some.	O
Shoes.	O
Everything I learned about.	CHITCHAT
Drawing feet.	CHITCHAT
In a cartoony way, or really at all came from Asterix.	CHITCHAT
Just look at how Oderzo Drew.	CHITCHAT
Feet.	CHITCHAT
And shoes and sandals, especially those sandals that used to draw the Roman.	CHITCHAT
Soldiers holy cow.	CHITCHAT
So look up Asterix.	CHITCHAT
Who dares oh?	CHITCHAT
Find some of his drawings and Holy Cow.	CHITCHAT
Look at the beautiful feet that he drew.	CHITCHAT
He knew anatomy so well.	CHITCHAT
One of my heroes rest in peace just died this year, as did another one of my heroes, Mort Drucker, who did all this amazing work from Mad Magazine character work.	CHITCHAT
Really, I mean, caricature doesn't doesn't say enough about.	CHITCHAT
What he did I mean, he really did some amazing stuff, but.	CHITCHAT
Alrighty so there we go.	O
About the ground, these guys, it's ground him.	O

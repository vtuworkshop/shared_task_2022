There we go.	O
Fix it, fix it.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
What's up, Angela?	CHITCHAT
Bye is coming along.	CHITCHAT
Look at this.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
It's a hard work.	CHITCHAT
Hard work.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing it, though we doing it.	CHITCHAT
Maybe Hans is where all the cool kids hang out, right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah you one of the cool kids.	CHITCHAT
The color palette on that piece is tight.	CHITCHAT
How to come up about selecting those colors?	CHITCHAT
All that's a good question, man.	CHITCHAT
So, uh, and I said this before.	CHITCHAT
Another videos on in this series is that, UM, I'm all about primary colors anyway.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't like mixing colors and all that stuff.	O
I'm not into the whole color theory.	O
Or what do you call it?	CHITCHAT
Color color theory I guess so, and I'm not really color blind.	CHITCHAT
But sometimes I look at a color and I think is one thing, and it's not an so, um, so my solution to that has been to just stay away from trying to mix colors, even though when I paint paint, brush, type paint, I do mix colors, but that's because it has to do with gradients and shadow.	O
Instead of like, uhm, the color wheel type of thing where you have the primary colors and then those other colors that start matching and so on.	O
I don't do all that.	O
Um, in any case.	CHITCHAT
So because I feel that I like I'm not gonna get the color that I want or understand the time if I got the right color or not, then what I do is instead it's just focus on primary colors.	O
So I've been doing that with all my heart work when it comes to us, they come with their own primary colors and and of course if you look at all acid artwork, the UM, it's a lot of primary colors is mainly primary colors.	O
And I'm so.	CHITCHAT
My solution so so so my process has been about primary, primary, primary well.	O
As time goes on now I want to with this with this particular.	O
Set I wanted to turn tone down some of those primary colors so I still stay primary red, Green, Blue, you know, etc.	O
But I want to kinda.	O
Not make the color so dramatic that they clash an so, so I just played around with it and that's what we came up with an right now.	O
As you can see, those are the colors right there.	O
Some are, some colors are really close to another color, and that's 'cause I'll use it in combination so that I can get a little bit of contrast, but nothing that stands out too hard.	O
So as an example here you know there goes.	O
I got in the snake, I got 2 blue colors and they're very close Blues.	O
So then when I do the shadow that blue stands out from the other blue and less.	O
You see the same figure but a different tone.	O
So it's just a really and this is an experiment.	O
This is not something that I know how to do very well.	O
This is just what I started to do, and um, it came out nice came out good.	O
I'm surprised, you know, but again, that's a challenge, right?	CHITCHAT
You challenge yourself.	CHITCHAT
And then I, you know.	CHITCHAT
and I study a lot of other artists.	CHITCHAT
I study a ton of other artists like I like.	CHITCHAT
When you say that he has a place where all the cool kids hang out.	CHITCHAT
Um, I am always.	CHITCHAT
Checking out other live streams from other artists I I follow nothing but artisan Instagram on Facebook.	CHITCHAT
I am friends with nobody but artists like I don't even know people.	CHITCHAT
I went to high school and stuff.	CHITCHAT
I don't care about those people.	CHITCHAT
I care about artists and when I see other hard to start another line work and their color coordination like whoa, that's blow my mind.	CHITCHAT
I take notes, mental notes.	CHITCHAT
OK, well next time I have a project.	CHITCHAT
Next time I'm working on something.	CHITCHAT
I'm experiment with that part and that's it.	CHITCHAT

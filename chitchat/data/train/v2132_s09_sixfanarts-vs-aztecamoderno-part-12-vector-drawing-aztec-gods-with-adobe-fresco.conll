That's how it came out.	CHITCHAT
Pretty happy this part that I'm doing right now is something that I'm used to are ready.	O
This is what I this is the part where I had several layers of shadow, several layers of highlights an and then the art kind of Pops a different way because I don't wanna use gradients.	O
I don't wanna use watercolors or are Photoshop brushes.	O
I want to use vectors, all vectors so you have to play with those vectors and then when I actually get into illustrator then I can tweak the shadows, give it a gradients and then it kind of gets smoother.	O
So so.	CHITCHAT
Solid big experiment right now.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for asking.	CHITCHAT
That's a great question and Angela says, wow, really coming together.	CHITCHAT
What is the theme for these drawings?	CHITCHAT
Thank you Angela.	CHITCHAT
It is coming together.	CHITCHAT
It's some it's taking me a lot of time, but if you check out my Behance portfolio and uh and the very second project in my be hands this one I just finished last night so I posted it and I need to do a little write up about it.	CHITCHAT
I'm using an app called Sketchable.	O
In any case, here is where you can read about everything related to this peace.	CHITCHAT
Anna is this my version of the six fanarts challenge now.	O
I understood later.	CHITCHAT
Hey frankly, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy watching some artist word.	CHITCHAT
Yes right, you just enjoy it right?	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
That's good.	CHITCHAT
That's right.	CHITCHAT
And thank you for enjoying my work.	CHITCHAT
I enjoy other artist worked.	CHITCHAT
'cause I can learn so when I realized later was that this six fan art challenge is supposed to be like you trying out different art styles in game characters to to to challenge yourself right outside of your comfort zone.	CHITCHAT
Where is so?	CHITCHAT
I didn't understand that part.	CHITCHAT
Ask them till after I started working on this piece.	CHITCHAT
What I did understand the beginning was you gotta challenge yourself and draw up 6 characters, popular culture or you know handyman whatever it is that you're into, you should draw those an.	CHITCHAT
So I told myself, well, you know I wanna draw that too but.	CHITCHAT
You know what?	CHITCHAT
If I just focused on the UM Astek Gods to kind of theme?	CHITCHAT
That I'm that I'm already working on, and, uh, and since I have, I I've been meaning to start drawing the gods annum and showing them in a more like a human look instead of instead of these drawings.	CHITCHAT
Now, when you think I've asked the cart work, this is what you think about right and so so I said well, what if I was to take these and then make it more more human like and as I was thinking that this a writer, his name is David Bowles.	CHITCHAT
He posted this on a Twitter, an so because there's a writers.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you man.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
The writers have been talking about quarantine nations and use.	CHITCHAT
I think it was like a Harry Potter type a um subject.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure 'cause I did not pay attention to those until after he posted this and I was like, Oh, there's my God.	CHITCHAT
That's right there, boom, first got in each one of these is which you look closely.	CHITCHAT
There's gotta be poker Moscato.	CHITCHAT
Stopped at an Siwa Cotton and so then uhm and then and then it was going to be my my God that I do for the six now quarantine, quarantine nation however, and I took away the work warranty 'cause I don't care about that.	CHITCHAT
I know that we're living through the time so I don't need to mention that into my project.	CHITCHAT
But at the six not one nation is the focusing.	CHITCHAT
So so excited.	CHITCHAT
To sketches and drawings and they look very rough and ugly in this looks kind of similar.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it's a little bit different.	CHITCHAT
And then I started working on all the different gods and so I think, uh, to me, it, uh, it helps me.	CHITCHAT
Further along the ideas that I have about mithy, my second mother know and stick 'em up there now is my way of bringing back the gas that has the guards into into modern times.	CHITCHAT
So that's where the word modern comes into play and that's it.	CHITCHAT
So wrong with that.	CHITCHAT
I'm going with it, that's it.	CHITCHAT
That's how I'm making it happen for myself and in my themes later on I was like somebody said.	CHITCHAT
Drawing ideas me, yeah, that's cool, but I'm already doing the thing and then that's when I realize oh wait a minute.	CHITCHAT
I supposed to try out different things, different styles, and then different types of characters from that demand a different style and so later on I was thinking, well, maybe I can draw.	CHITCHAT
This guys or other gods, but then I'll try 6 different art styles and that can do that I got.	CHITCHAT

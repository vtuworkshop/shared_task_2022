I've been drawing for a long time I got tons of styles.	CHITCHAT
And, uh, and so that may be something I do later on.	CHITCHAT
Mara.	CHITCHAT
I'm not asking to stress out about it, but that's it.	CHITCHAT
That's all.	CHITCHAT
It makes me think about.	CHITCHAT
Well, maybe I didn't do the challenge the way whoever first thought of thinking about it, but I did it my way and I'm happy.	CHITCHAT
There is a long answer.	CHITCHAT
Watch out with the questions 'cause I got long answers would be here awhile.	CHITCHAT
Any case, uh.	CHITCHAT
Mom, I hope that answers the question.	CHITCHAT
For the thing.	CHITCHAT
Phone.	CHITCHAT
And of course, some yes, Matt and anybody else who asked question.	CHITCHAT
I got long answers.	CHITCHAT
I will talk about what I do.	CHITCHAT
And that's something that's important for artists to know how to talk about their work.	CHITCHAT
Just know how to talk about your work and I'll put you in a whole different level from other artists.	CHITCHAT
From the artist who doesn't know how to say things about themselves.	CHITCHAT
And I my extrovert so I would definitely talk about myself.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now we're getting to a point where some of these lines are not gonna are not are not come very visible like this one right here right now, but then they're very visible.	O
I can just read.	O
Area.	O
And uh, and so what's going to happen is?	CHITCHAT
And now let me do this yellow here.	O
The man.	O
Boom, and what I'm gonna do is turn down the Opacity.	O
See that there we go, so now it becomes real highlight, but in some places where you're not gonna see that so well.	O
So like in this sum in this in this brownish color, and then this luish color, what I'm going to do is going to add a second a second layer in the second layer is really going to be a copy of this layer, so you'll see when I get to it.	O
And I like this brush this this some.	O
This brush that starts like fat that starts then it goes fast and it goes back to thin tapered uh because that some when I started drawing a in Adobe draw it was another program before that.	O
A couple other versions of the program forgot now.	O
It was amazing.	CHITCHAT
I loved it.	CHITCHAT
I love him so now.	CHITCHAT
So now that this brushes here, I am going to use it and I just realized there's some parts that I need to fix when it comes to this all right there.	O
The shadow shading.	O
Turn.	O
There we go.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's not good.	O
This one.	O
Uh-huh Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like that.	O
Like saying things that pop off.	O
I really like this, so now I realize that makes it being some highlights here in this age of the face.	O
We'll get to that if I don't forget.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to this, boom.	O
This is the whites.	O
Yep, back to the brush.	O
Very sure finding hard sometimes talk about your heart.	CHITCHAT
I'm an introvert, mostly mostly, that's maybe.	CHITCHAT
That's why.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and you know.	CHITCHAT
Is practice, so there's a so number one you should practice so that you can speak about your heart.	CHITCHAT
Is that also makes you so smart and that puts you in a different bracket than most artists.	CHITCHAT
And art is a very intimate thing.	CHITCHAT
We start our careers just because we want to draw.	CHITCHAT
But then it turns into real, you know, business and those who can talk to a client, explain themselves or breakdown their projects in words and let our client Pilates they're gonna get to get.	CHITCHAT
Somebody else may have more talent, but those who can talk we're going to get the gate.	CHITCHAT
And in so so.	CHITCHAT

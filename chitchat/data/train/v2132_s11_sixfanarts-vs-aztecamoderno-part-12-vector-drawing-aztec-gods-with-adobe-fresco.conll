So even though we start off, you know drawn because we feel like it.	CHITCHAT
We want to.	CHITCHAT
There has to come a point where you should be able to explain it.	CHITCHAT
And share on why it is that.	CHITCHAT
Why why you do what you do.	CHITCHAT
It's the same time, uhm?	CHITCHAT
It also that so, so at the same time you should practice that anyway because.	CHITCHAT
It it forces you to understand yourself.	CHITCHAT
And your art, what it means I'm gonna stand for.	CHITCHAT
And that is that is hard for.	CHITCHAT
See I see a question let me finish this here.	CHITCHAT
Come on.	CHITCHAT
You have to know who you are, why you draw, why do you create?	CHITCHAT
Why should somebody pay you?	CHITCHAT
Hi everybody has it.	CHITCHAT
Phone call message now cuckoo where am I in my hair white?	CHITCHAT
White color cool.	CHITCHAT
So Matt says you have a similar brush.	CHITCHAT
They using illustrator as well.	CHITCHAT
No man I do not and was crazy is that?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Because I draw in illustrator, I've been drawing.	CHITCHAT
I've been using illustrator.	CHITCHAT
For Uhm.	CHITCHAT
For 1920 years, like literally.	CHITCHAT
I have, uh.	CHITCHAT
And I had we had drawing tablets back in those days.	CHITCHAT
I still wanna find one just just for old time sake.	CHITCHAT
Uh, the HP HP made him forget what the other brands where in any case.	CHITCHAT
The the answer is no, so I started drawing with illustrator with uh.	CHITCHAT
You know, doing the anchor points and pencil and so on.	O
But I was using the mouse.	O
And, uh, so I got really good at it.	CHITCHAT
I could really.	CHITCHAT
I got really good at drawing with a mouse.	CHITCHAT
And uh, until I started getting those computers that let you draw.	O
And so then I started using A and then with the blob rush came around.	O
I forget what year that was, uhm?	CHITCHAT
The blob brush came around and now you could draw a right 'cause there's a pencil tool, but I don't like it.	O
I don't really like you.	CHITCHAT
About accuracy and control and.	O
Uh, when I draw and that pencil tool does not give me that, but that blah brush off you can draw with the blob Russian, you get shapes.	O
Uh, the blood rushes.	O
The shape is a shape so.	O
Ah, mom, that was kind of cool to discover and try out.	CHITCHAT
And so then what I did is, uhm, when, uh, uh.	CHITCHAT
Adobe Line, Adobe ideas.	CHITCHAT
Adobe ideas became Adobe Line came Adobe draw.	O
So somewhere in the ideas in line I had an ipad and I started playing with those.	O
I did not have an Apple pencil and iPad did not support the Apple pencil in those days.	O
Man, I I found this this brush and at first it was hard to to to deal with this like what what what do I do with that is rough but let me show you my first one of my first drawing so I think it's still here.	CHITCHAT
Come on Internet, there we go.	CHITCHAT
On his way out there right there artist Queen so, and this is a Adobe illustrator draw.	CHITCHAT
Yep, I've been featured three times in illustrator draw three times in Frisco.	CHITCHAT
And this is one of my first drawings.	CHITCHAT
Actually.	CHITCHAT
Yes, someone in my first ones.	CHITCHAT
And so this started an illustrator and I like it how so stiff?	CHITCHAT
Because this is a drawing that I didn't pencil old is cool, I like it blah blah.	CHITCHAT
I want to draw this and then I was 2010.	CHITCHAT
And then, uh, and then I did it started an illustrator laying there and then boom.	CHITCHAT
Heroes illustrator draw.	CHITCHAT
On the iPad.	CHITCHAT
It's amazing.	CHITCHAT
And then I went deep with this.	CHITCHAT
This.	CHITCHAT
This place is a pleasure to stop, but no I'm crazy I'm crazy.	CHITCHAT
I went crazy with it.	CHITCHAT
You could check out the whole project went crazy with it and then crazier more detail and then more detail and more layers and it was it's it's a mess.	CHITCHAT
I print this out but I do have a printer.	CHITCHAT
It's right there.	CHITCHAT
I do have that that whole thing.	CHITCHAT
I printed that out.	CHITCHAT
It's big.	CHITCHAT

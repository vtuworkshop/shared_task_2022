Once I finish this one piece, and, uh.	CHITCHAT
Not sure if I can come back tonight.	CHITCHAT
But I think it's a good start I get a good all.	CHITCHAT
A good figuring out my colors.	O
There's a bunch of whiteness anyway here.	O
Just take those down.	O
There's white missing.	O
Let's do it.	O
And the it's Blue White.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
When you start, you like, Oh, I know what I want.	O
Or I think I might figure it out when you're drawing it you like this is great.	O
And, uh, when you doing the concept, this is awesome.	O
And then.	O
Halfway through your line, man.	O
Did I do this to myself?	O
Hi, the question is could could make for an interesting challenge after you're done with this, hit that good old blah brush up again.	CHITCHAT
You know, actually as a matter of fact, tell you what happens.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, when we're done.	CHITCHAT
I'm done here in Frisco.	O
I export as a PDF.	O
An open in a illustrator.	O
Once I open illustrator, I clean up a little bit.	O
There's some things that kind of end up out of Wack.	O
I could see the colors clearly.	O
I started putting layers together and, uh, in order and so on, right?	O
And so then there will be times when some colors missing or not this this could look better if I had more more.	O
If it was still, then more or whatever little details, and so that's when I break out the blob brush and I have to try to get my lines to kind of match because I'm not gonna get the same lines if a outsider fresco or Adobe draw.	O
Answer yeah I have done that many times you got to.	O
OK, that's it for that one.	CHITCHAT
Send a completely happy.	CHITCHAT
But I think I have to roll with it until I think of something else.	O
But if I do this.	O
Oh yeah, that's good.	O
See that's how he discovered things.	CHITCHAT
Just don't stop.	CHITCHAT
Some things you can't plan.	CHITCHAT
You just roll with it.	CHITCHAT
So that has more of a flow like the shoulder does.	O
And.	O
Let's go here.	O
Good.	O
All right now, the white.	O
This is the white.	O
Uh-huh	CHITCHAT
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
Duplicate.	O
So it's gonna look brighter no problem.	O
Home and you know?	CHITCHAT
I'm on, uh on the surface right now.	O
So actually jump into illustrator anytime with this device.	O
That's why I like about the service.	CHITCHAT
I enjoy my iPad, but it's not like the surface I'm trying to tell you.	CHITCHAT
I honestly say.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh All right?	CHITCHAT
That's why I didn't do that on this side.	O
OK OK OK.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh There we go.	O
Yeah I need to see I need to finish my work in illustrator.	O
It gives me.	O
Then I can play with gradients.	O
So some of these layers like the shadows I can blend all this in together nice and eat in illustrator.	O
Throwing that gradient.	O
Boom and then uh, uh, uh, have a smoother blend.	O
So yeah, you may laugh.	CHITCHAT
But I will do it I.	CHITCHAT
I love illustrator uh-huh throwing down.	CHITCHAT

What was happening here?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, you sometimes it generates the video from the beginning of the the the document.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it just does that.	CHITCHAT
Last time you were here.	CHITCHAT
I don't know something is weird, but I like having a video of some of my work, so here's an well that's happening.	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at.	CHITCHAT
6 Fanarts Frame lapses look at that.	CHITCHAT
I got all the videos of all the times I don't work on this piece, so then I can make a whole another friend last video.	CHITCHAT
Right boom, there goes boom boom, boom.	CHITCHAT
There it is.	O
Uh-huh that one I don't know what happened with Miss Cotton.	O
I did a lot of work on it and then it kind of just.	O
Like skipped over all of it, whereas gets a cold, it's worth doing the work you're showing me to work.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
There this is showing.	O
Backgrounds.	O
That worked on that one.	O
I think I finished all the backgrounds at the end of that one.	O
Wanna always save your work?	CHITCHAT
Dumb, dumb dumb.	CHITCHAT
It's just low quality video though.	O
It's kind of tough.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh Addison backgrounds	O
Hey girls mobile boom, that's it done right?	CHITCHAT
So that's kind of cool is cool to have those.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well yeah it is taking awhile.	CHITCHAT
Well once we get through to generating the preview and having a video, what I like to do after that is uhm.	O
To go ahead and then go back to the home page or home screen of Adobe fresco, let the creative cloud back it up and sync.	O
Then you close the program and that's it.	O
That's the deal.	CHITCHAT
That's the idea behind the creative cloud is not just the money you're paying is not just for one program to programs.	O
Three programs is for everything that creative cloud does, and it's getting to the point where no matter what device you work in.	O
You have access to your work to your party, your profiles and to your files so that you can then, um, work from anywhere in anything.	O
So let's go back to that page.	O
There it is.	O
And now this is the the video.	O
So now I export and this is going to be.	O
And the frame glasses and it's gonna be.	O
Version 16 From there it is, save it.	O
Done, now I go back to the house.	O
And it's going to save the document.	O
Their egos come on.	CHITCHAT
It's a big document.	CHITCHAT
Who said this document is heavy?	CHITCHAT
Oh wait.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I had to like, uh, now that I finished discussing Poca delete his uhm picture from here.	O
Because, uh, it's starting to get really, really big.	O
Files and it's a mobile app.	O
They'll be fresco.	O
It's a mobile app.	O
There it goes.	O
Just trying to sync is not syncing.	O
There's a problem.	O
But it's right here.	O
These are all my cloud documents.	O
Click on here.	O
, Bone.	CHITCHAT
Right, so there's 15 and is trying to sync.	O
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to duplicate that file.	O
Boom, there it is 615 copy.	O
Right, I'm gonna rename it.	O
Uh, renaming?	CHITCHAT
As a 16.	O
It was crazy.	CHITCHAT
Is that now it actually saved original 15, but it's OK.	O
Boom there goes is sinking and there's an error, but at least it saved at 15 one see.	O
So I'm playing with the app to make sure that it works properly and it backs up to the cloud.	O
However, there is a problem with this computer.	CHITCHAT
I think this is the surface it gives me that problem, which is why I use a different surface and so.	CHITCHAT
But then I kind of like the surface anyways.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna close the app, right?	O
Boom the app is closed.	O
Open the app again.	O
And out of it should try to force those the sink, and that's it.	O
That's all I got for you today.	CHITCHAT
No errors you see, that's really good cloud.	CHITCHAT

All rights hello everyone.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you there.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully he dared me.	CHITCHAT
OK, it's good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
I'm starting this Adobe coloring book, which I want to show you a right away so we can go ahead and get this party started.	O
Just getting everything set up.	CHITCHAT
There we are alright, so welcome everyone.	CHITCHAT
Welcome Benjamin.	CHITCHAT
I see your name.	CHITCHAT
Hello everyone.	CHITCHAT
Mirror and everyone.	CHITCHAT
I go ahead and switch screens 'cause I want to get into this.	CHITCHAT
We're working on this Adobe coloring book, which I think is pretty exciting to me and I love to be challenged so.	CHITCHAT
Let me just switch over.	CHITCHAT
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
There you go.	CHITCHAT
All right there we are there, we have it.	CHITCHAT
You can see my screen.	CHITCHAT
This is the Adobe coloring book and it's just a project that we thought we'd work on just to keep kids from being bored and adults from being bored.	O
And here is the link that I can paste in chat for you as well.	O
Say Hello.	CHITCHAT
Hello, I see you there from Hungary, ICU, Tom.	CHITCHAT
Good to see.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's just pin this comment as well.	CHITCHAT
You might be.	CHITCHAT
Joining me from other places, it's always good to have you omati fivin and everyone.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, everybody's names are so small right now on my screen, but this is at the Adobe coloring books, so we are at least a couple pages, right?	CHITCHAT
So you can see chapter one which is all about the alphabet and we can scroll through the different artists and what they may.	O
But the cool thing is they have a link right here.	O
PDF, PSD, JPEG and I'm going to make one of these today, but we can check out this gorgeous work as we could see right here.	O
Again, this is all about the alphabet made by different artists, which I think is pretty cool, so I'm going to work on page.	O
Today we're going to get knocked out.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully you enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
I really like this by Ann Chin.	CHITCHAT
I think that was awesome.	CHITCHAT
Stay kind.	CHITCHAT
Everyone.	CHITCHAT
That's good advice.	CHITCHAT
So Hello Felicia, good to have you in Natalie as well.	CHITCHAT
And some people over there on Facebook I see you.	CHITCHAT
Should I make the text little bit larger Johannesburg's in the House Chicago cool alright so.	CHITCHAT
So you're also going to get a sneak peak as well, 'cause we have alphabet and then the next week was gratitude and now we have animals, which is book 3.	O
But I'm going to work on when they actually should be released this week, which is all about.	O
It's click over dreams or dreaming.	O
So dreams.	CHITCHAT
Whatever something like that, I'm going to do this all in illustrator.	O
I already have a plan squared away so I'm going to go ahead and dive into this and we're going to have some fun creating what is going to be a black and white illustration.	O
Will get into colourising it an again I might be jumping ahead a little bit, but you know sometimes I'll start with just a simple illustration.	O
As you can see here, I'll hit N to bring up the pencil.	O
I'll make sure the pencil tool is set to smooth 'cause I want to make this easy on me and it's not going to have any color, right?	O
And I'll just kind of jump in here.	O
I'm going to change this.	O
Let's change the traditional light blue and somehow I changed my preferences for the anchor display.	O
By the way, I usually make this larger so everybody can see it.	O
But let's not worry about that right now, OK?	O
OK, so let's dive into this.	O
Here's my pencil.	O
I'm going to start drawing.	O
I'm just going to start outlining this face that I just imported.	O
Just picked a pencil.	O
It's just currently defaulting to.	O
Let's make it 1 point.	O
Notice how I wouldn't be on the cheek right here.	O
I'll jump in and sort of.	O
Just roll over that last part of that line and continue on my way.	O
Anytime you screw up.	O
Because of my preferences for the pencil, it set to edit selected paths.	O
OK, so that means I can roll over my path.	O
Right here and then draw again.	O
And by the way I'm just using.	O
A mouse, so I'm not using some fancy Wacom or anything like that.	O
I did this a couple weeks ago for the Adobe Daily Creative Challenge.	CHITCHAT
The illustrator daily creative challenge.	CHITCHAT
So if you've seen this before, that's where it's from.	CHITCHAT
Aaron, what's up high from nowhere Ohio?	CHITCHAT

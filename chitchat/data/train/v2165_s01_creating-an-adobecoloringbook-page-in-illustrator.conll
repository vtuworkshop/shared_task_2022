I'm sure you're from somewhere, but that's OK.	CHITCHAT
I'll just bring this up and around.	O
It's kind of do some park shapes in the hair.	O
Bring that around like so we'll do.	O
The ear is going to be a different shape.	O
Just like that, and let's get this party started.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be more than just outlining right?	O
But we gotta start somewhere and I didn't want to cheat too much by having something already drawn, but I'm just going to jump into this because I want to get into text.	O
I want to get a coloring.	O
I want to get into new some fun brushes that we could really make this come to life quickly.	O
And again, I'm just doing the simple shapes guitar collarbone in there like that.	O
Something like that and I can continue this up, down and around K.	O
You mess up.	O
You could always roll over this.	O
I often find that actually, if I work at a smaller screen size, it's actually easier.	O
It's less distance that my mouse has to travel and I can get smoother herbs, right?	O
So that's all I'm doing right now.	O
Let me know if you have questions.	CHITCHAT
Don't see alot happen in chat and maybe I just need to refresh this.	CHITCHAT
Matt James, you're too kind.	CHITCHAT
I'm so happy that you're here.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to Holleran	CHITCHAT
Good on Facebook.	CHITCHAT
Alright, good have you Charles from Mexico.	CHITCHAT
Cool alright, let's jump into the lips really fast just keeping this simple will outline the lips right now.	O
OK so this is going to be a complete shape.	O
In this case, since I want a little more detail, I might jump in here and take this right to the middle OK.	O
And by the way, I could hit feet P for the pen tool and make sure it forecasts that line or Telegraph sit so I know where that next stroke is going, just like that.	O
If you happen to put a point down autumn in it for it to be there, you could hold down the spacebar and pick it back up.	O
But I'm going to draw that out.	O
I have some snapping going on, not crazy about it, but let's go ahead and do that a lot of times you'll get this sharp edge right there at that point.	O
Well, the properties panel click on stroke.	O
And we'll round the corners book and I round caps typically right, and that's what we could do for the lovely lips, which I'm so tempted to color red right now.	O
But again, I just kind of switch between the pen tool in the pencil tool as I create the mouth.	O
So that's how I've done this illustration.	O
I'm going to jump in.	O
I'm going to show you something else really fast, so I have this.	O
Let's take this down over here.	O
I'm going to get into all these organic shapes for the eyes and everything right in the nose, right?	O
Well again, I don't want to have a uniform line like that.	O
OK, I actually want to jump in and I'm going to change the width profile to something a little bit more interesting, right?	O
Changing that with profile so it's going to get thin, thick and thin again around.	O
This knows I want it to be even thinner right over here, so we'll use the width tools will jump in, grab it right there, and shrink it down like so for that part.	O
And again, I can make it thicker right here.	O
But I have control over the thickness of that line.	O
As you may know, since there are some pros here good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
Rollo Salma sunlamp.	CHITCHAT
Alright, cool you got that.	CHITCHAT
I go through starts, outline the lines but I've already done a lot of this work but I will do that.	CHITCHAT
I'll sometimes either outline the eyebrows.	O
Like so.	O
Or I'll make them filled right?	O
I can do the same thing with just a single stroke.	O
With the pencil drawing out this line, making this thick like so, cranking up the thickness and still using the width tool right in here.	O
Grabbing Nishan, making it thicker on this side, and then thinner over here, for instance, let's just delete that point right there.	O
You get the idea.	O
OK, cool, let's move on 'cause I actually already have this done, so this is kind of where this is ended up.	O
Let's just kind of jump ahead a little bit.	O
Here's the woman outlined, filled in exactly as you'd expect.	O
So this is the start of it, right?	O
Looking good so far just by outlining photo.	O
I'm going to take this word dream, right?	O
Let's just take just the D right there, bam?	O
Take idea, I'll shrink that down.	O
I'll change this letter to R.	O
Some of you might know what I'm going to do.	O
I'm going to rotate it and make it smaller like so for my preferences.	O
If I go into general, I don't want to.	O
I don't want to scale strokes and effects.	O
Keep the strokes and effects that keeping the same size so when I look at the stroke here, I always wanted to be like one point, for instance.	O
So right over here I want to make sure this is one.	O
Is always one point even when I size things down or make them larger, I might change that later, but right now I'm going to select these two objects and you guessed it, we're going to blend tool click click and we can blend those two together, right?	O

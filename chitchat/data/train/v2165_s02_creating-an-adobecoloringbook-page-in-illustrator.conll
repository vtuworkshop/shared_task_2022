Let's go ahead, go into blend an let's reverse.	O
Riverside don't want to reverse the spine.	O
I want to reverse front to back.	O
Boom, there we are.	CHITCHAT
Now we have that D like so let's go inside of it, Papa.	O
We have this path and I'm sorry this is.	O
Gray and kind of hard to see.	O
Let me just change the color of it.	O
Give me 1 second.	CHITCHAT
Change this to green or something brighter.	O
Or blue.	O
There we go.	O
So Cohen in here to two of the line in here as well.	O
Well, I can replace this line just by drawing over it.	O
That's what I want to do now.	O
Make it kind of Sushi.	O
Like that OK, give it a little bit of curve in a little bit of flavor.	O
And just to make it like look a little bit more unique.	O
Maybe I'll get rid of some of those points.	O
I did the same thing with the pen tool, but now I can kind of have some fun with this.	O
Taking this, let's rotate it.	O
Like so there we have it.	O
Right, you get the idea.	O
Cool thing is you only need to do this once.	O
Ha, let me check there we are There you are there.	O
Everybody is.	O
Let's paste this in one more time.	O
There you go.	O
I just paste it in the link.	CHITCHAT
In case you didn't see that before to this coloring books, I could see all your names.	CHITCHAT
Watch him from Tunisia.	CHITCHAT
Awesome Tanzania.	CHITCHAT
Tanzania, sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Two different places.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I can now kind of control that, so this is going to be kind of fun now, right?	CHITCHAT
It could take this letter.	O
This is looking pretty cool.	O
I want it to be behind her head.	O
It is great.	O
I'm going to just duplicate it.	O
Change the letter.	O
Boo are well, guess what this other later later needs to be E.	O
So D flows into RE AM.	O
That's what's happening right?	CHITCHAT
Let's take this.	O
Let's rotate it around and move it down like that.	O
And change this.	O
To go over there.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
I can see all your names now.	CHITCHAT
Melissa Collins in the house.	CHITCHAT
What's up Melissa?	CHITCHAT
Cool, so yeah, I'd have the same size and stroke sorrows here and loving it.	O
Zorro, good have you got the coolest name in the book?	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at these little points right there that I kind of need to clean up.	O
It's not going to matter 'cause it's actually behind her head, so I really don't need to worry about any of this.	O
I can manipulate this all I want, but it's totally fine.	O
Let's go back in here, boom, duplicated again as fast as we can.	O
Let's get moving 'cause I want to colorize this 2E.	O
Moving out like that.	O
Let me know if you have suggestions.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you like this.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should do something different.	CHITCHAT
I want to get into different brushes as well.	O
This one should be rotated differently.	O
Now if I use my direct selection tool right, I can use my direct selection tool so I don't need to go inside of that object each and every time, right?	O
I could just select this E, rotate it this way.	O
Move it down, move that up, but you get the idea.	O
OK, so you could use the direct selection as well.	O
Change this.	O
Hey Larry, our Dream Baby Dream Big Xiaoyi Move this over, move this down.	O
Change this.	O
Definitely let's move this over there like that.	O
Get rid of some of these points.	O
Alright, talk to me how you doing how Malcolm from Georgia?	CHITCHAT
How are you doing today?	CHITCHAT
How is Georgia doing, huh?	CHITCHAT
How is Georgia?	CHITCHAT
How is lovely Georgia?	CHITCHAT
Let's grab that line.	O
Poop.	CHITCHAT
OK, grabbing his last letter M.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
It is beautiful Monday today I'm.	CHITCHAT
Here in Lovely Denver, where Melissa is from as well.	CHITCHAT
So JoJo from Las Vegas good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if you have questions.	CHITCHAT
Again, sometimes we need to dream to escape and that's why this is OK, right?	CHITCHAT
So far so good.	CHITCHAT
We got this dreaming going on.	CHITCHAT
We could add more to this right?	O
We have this part.	O
In fact, here's a.	O
Here are some fun text.	O
Here's some text below, right?	O
So you can see how this is all created.	O
You know how this is done anyways, right?	CHITCHAT
Thank you Hayden, I appreciate it, but I want to add more to this.	CHITCHAT

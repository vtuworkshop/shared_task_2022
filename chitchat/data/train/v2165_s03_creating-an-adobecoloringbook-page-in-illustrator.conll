Actually want to do a cool burst in the background.	O
You ready for this?	CHITCHAT
I love this trick.	CHITCHAT
I do this actually quite a bit more than I ever thought I would, but I'm going to do a burst.	O
You're ready, here is a simple line.	O
Excuse me, it's actually just an ellipse.	O
A circle for this circle.	O
I want to increase the stroke a lot, right?	O
We're going to make it really big.	O
In fact, I'm just going to type in like.	O
500 to something like that.	O
It's really thick, really big.	O
Let's stretch it out.	O
Kay?	CHITCHAT
It is a circle.	O
With a stroke of.	O
500 pixels, sorry, you can't see that it's a stroke.	O
Let's change the color.	O
There it is.	O
OK, so I'm going to go to properties.	O
I'm going to stroke.	O
And I'm going to change this to dash line right?	O
So changing that to dash line gives us this cool burst now and this is what I want.	O
I want like a burst of like 70 points.	O
50 for the gap something like that, let's go.	O
70 for the gap.	O
Maybe?	CHITCHAT
Ah, so this is.	CHITCHAT
Check this out.	CHITCHAT
This should work.	CHITCHAT
Check this out.	CHITCHAT
This little buttons important 'cause look at how it doesn't match up.	O
You see in this Omo in Blanche see how this isn't quite matching up.	O
This is unacceptable, but I'll go right over here.	O
This little button aligns the dashes to corners and all that good stuff and now it falls into line and that looks good.	O
So again, keep in mind this is a stroke so we could change this down.	O
We go from 50.	O
And you could see how it creates that cool burst.	O
You get the idea.	O
Ah Alright, fantastic.	CHITCHAT
So I have this set to 500.	O
That's what I'm going to do there.	O
I'm actually going to expand appearance.	O
And I'm going to expand these filled in the stroke, flip that around.	O
Put some dots in there.	O
Let's put some dots in there, shall we?	O
Let's go down.	O
Did you know in the Swatch libraries, there's patterns and I can go to these basic dots so I have all these fun dots that I can work with and for these dots.	O
Check this out, I can add these dots as ultimately add these as a different color, but I'm just going to add this these dots as a different fill so there we go.	O
We have these dots, a dot pattern that I can then change the sizeof or whatever, and that looks pretty cool.	O
Not to mention that we're going to give it a stroke of one.	O
OK, that's done.	O
Let's move that appearance down there.	O
Let's get rid of that.	O
Let's turn on our other layers that we're working on.	O
Boom, boom, right?	CHITCHAT
Stream big baby right?	CHITCHAT
I think this is already coming along nicely.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully you're into it.	CHITCHAT
Hatched.	CHITCHAT
Alright, Oh my, how are you doing great useful trial at Jason?	CHITCHAT
What's up?	CHITCHAT
It will be up later.	CHITCHAT
You could always just come back to this exact same link and it's going to be there.	CHITCHAT
I want to add more to this, 'cause I think it needs a burst of color.	O
It needs like Flowers and branches.	O
If you know me that's it's not a pool stream and less.	O
Unless there Flowers in it basically right?	O
Well and I'm already have already have a lot of this squared away, so let's lock down everything and let's just turn this on 'cause I have some items right over here, right that are already created.	O
Nothing too fancy, but we got some cool branches right in here, right?	O
and I want to create a branch brush.	O
Let's do that.	O
Right now I'm going to grab this graphic, drop it into the brushes library and let's just expand that out.	O
There are already a couple in there.	O
But let's drop it into.	O
My brush panel and we're going to make a scatter brush clicking OK.	O
And we already have our scatter brush.	O
Click OK.	O
Here it is right here, OK?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to draw with it.	O
Just so you could see what we get.	O
Let's select it.	O
There it is selected.	O
Let's draw.	O
That's what we get for our brush, which is nothing terribly exciting, but I want to go in and change all these fun properties with.	O
It's going to double click on that brush and go into.	O
The options were going to change everything to random.	O
And we're going to change this.	O
It's going to go from 50% size to 150% size, and that's what I'll do I know 50% spacing to 150% spacing.	O
Same thing for scatter negative 50% up to 150%.	O
Something like that.	O
The rotation it's going to.	O
It's going to be all over the place, but once this is done you ready for this we can preview it.	O
Bam, you get what's happening there.	O
Let's go ahead and apply that to the strokes and you can see as I draw.	O
I got these fun like scatter brushes for our lovely drawing 'cause what I want is a bunch of branches and again it's controlled by the stroke as well so I can come in fill in some branches down there like that and we could put some in the background as well.	O

Yeah, that work for you.	CHITCHAT
Ah, right, so again, super cool, super easy to work with, and that's what I did for all of these.	O
All of these graphics are now brushes right?	O
In here they're just being scattered everywhere.	O
And now they're at my fingertips so I can jump in here and take this heart brush my double click on it.	O
You can see it set up the pretty much the same way, except for it's not going to rotate, so it's not going to rotate.	O
Everything else is going to be exciting about.	CHITCHAT
It will come over here will select the heart.	O
Will hit N for pencil and let's just kind of draw in some fun hearts.	O
Can you see those hearts appearing kind of out of nowhere?	O
It's kind of nice, right?	CHITCHAT
Take him down in size, just a touch 'cause there a little large.	O
Right, and This is why I like illustrator.	O
It's like all of this is editable.	O
Let's put some hearts in the background.	O
Right, and they're just part of the background.	O
As you can see, right?	CHITCHAT
We can add some more Flowers.	O
Why not?	CHITCHAT
Possibly, but is having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Let me know how you're doing or some more Flowers.	CHITCHAT
Make those a little bit smaller.	O
Draw another line, let's add these Flowers in here.	O
Another set of Flowers as well.	O
I'm just having fun right now, right?	CHITCHAT
And here you have like within.	CHITCHAT
I don't know when did I start I started.	CHITCHAT
20 minutes ago and we already have something pretty cool that is starting to become our Adobe coloring book, which is kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright hello from India good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
Uh, yeah, so pretty straightforward, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
Hello, thanks from Israel.	CHITCHAT
Good to have you here Lori as well.	CHITCHAT
Lovely effect on the letters which I already covered.	O
We can get into coloring this by the way, so I'm going to Fast forward a little bit.	O
Hello, here's a let's do this, which I already have some created.	CHITCHAT
So this is what I would do.	CHITCHAT
By the way, we can make color versions of all of these brushes.	O
Technically we have to make new brushes, but I have color versions of this heart, right?	O
So again, what did I do I just took and made a color heart right over here.	O
There it is.	O
There's our friend.	CHITCHAT
Let's make it pink.	O
Right drop it in here.	O
Make it a scatter brush and everything scattered right?	O
So again, you do have to make supper brushes that are not editable afterward, which is kind of a bummer, right?	O
But we want to randomize all these settings.	O
All these letters I usually give them exact numbers, but you get the idea.	O
Click it, OK, there's a new brush, right?	O
Our new color brush so we can go in and select.	O
Uh, just so everybody could see.	O
Here are my hearts.	O
I could select all these hearts and use these new brushes every time I click on it.	O
I get a different rendition since it's a random, OK.	O
So that's what I would do for all my brushes, right?	O
Make a.	O
Color version of them again, was painting with the Flowers over here.	O
Excuse me with the with the hearts.	O
These guys are more versions writes everything is kind of on its own crazy layer.	O
But let's take some of these same thing here.	O
Select these.	O
There we go, different versions right colored as well.	O
So that's how I ended up with this so you can see our initial line drawing right.	O
All these are just a bunch of scribbles 'cause there a bunch of paths with a brush applied to them, right?	O
And you can see this version.	O
Here is an interesting one.	CHITCHAT
Is this pencil right?	CHITCHAT
Look at this fun pencil right?	CHITCHAT
So how is this made?	CHITCHAT
Pencil was made?	CHITCHAT
And actually what I did is I started making different versions and these are my field lines, but let me show you this ready.	O
I'm going to take this pencil, drop it in here and I'm going to make it an art brush clicking OK.	O
I'm going to make sure that it only stretches between.	O
These two guides, so only the metal parts going to stretch and it's going to maintain the proportions of the eraser and the end of the pencil.	O
So now when I go over here, in fact I want to maybe get rid of the other pencils altogether.	O
Make a new layer selecting my pencil hit N.	O
But there we are, drawing a pencil with a pencil, right?	O
Super fun.	CHITCHAT
Zoop you get the idea.	CHITCHAT

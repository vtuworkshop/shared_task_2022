Cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some in the background.	O
And let's get to the last little bit that I want to do.	O
Again, there's all sorts of pencils back there.	O
Now let's jump ahead to.	O
This final version you ready for it?	O
There's more I need to show, by the way.	O
Here's one that has been colorized OK, so Justin, Jesse, you know I went through when I edited all of these.	O
All of these letters as well, so let's just go ahead and show you just the letters which I showed you earlier and they can transition from one color to the next.	O
OK, so if I select this letter right, will select this one up there it is.	O
Let's open this up.	O
Change the color too.	O
A lovely pink will change this one down here to a green and it will make that nice transition for this one.	O
It's going to be the grade right down here.	O
We select it.	O
Will you go back to say blue for instance?	O
But again, that's how this was put together and hopefully you're catching a vision for how this is done, right?	CHITCHAT
And this has been around awhile, but pretty pretty fun and easy to work with.	CHITCHAT
OK, so he you need to calm down.	CHITCHAT
I get it.	CHITCHAT
Mal dives awesome alright, let's move on.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, that's the whole idea.	CHITCHAT
The fun thing is, is like once you get everything colorized.	CHITCHAT
So I went through and just added color to her.	O
I added the only gradient I haven't here is for her cheeks, just gave her a little bit of rosiness for her cheeks, and I felt like it needed it.	O
If we could see that right there.	O
OK, here are my branches.	O
Here's some more Flowers that are colorized.	O
Here's.	O
Some more hearts coming in.	O
And then we have some more Flowers as well.	O
And Lastly, are Fun pencils.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Adding are burst in the background right?	O
And then even just a background fill of blue.	O
Now I'm going to end with this.	O
Thank you so much for joining me.	CHITCHAT
I know I haven't been looking at chat much, and I do apologize.	CHITCHAT
Uh, hopefully like this Erico.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to lock down.	O
The only thing I don't want to change is that is the woman in the middle.	O
She could always just remain.	O
I don't want her turning purple or some weird colors are going to lock her down.	O
We're going to select everything else and we're going to go to edit, edit colors, and we're going to recolor this artwork here.	O
All the colors I can go into edit.	O
I can lock this down and I can start shifting the colours anyway I want.	O
And this is just a chance for me to play with different colors.	O
Yeah no.	O
Hopefully that makes sense.	O
Shahid Calm down buddy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and this will be available live.	CHITCHAT
I'm not crazy about these colors.	O
In fact, I could use these other color groups right over here.	O
I could use this beach #4.	O
I'm kind of into these colors 'cause I want it to be bright and fun, so I'll just select that color group right and you could see it changes it to like a Sherbert.	O
Ah, beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Writes Bryan, doesn't this work?	CHITCHAT
Doesn't in this nice.	CHITCHAT
Yes they say it stay home, everybody just be chill, hang out with me.	CHITCHAT
Just appreciate you being here but I love this recolor artwork.	CHITCHAT
I honestly don't even need to tweak it at all.	CHITCHAT
It looks just looks so good, but I could go into some of these others and you can see how ugly they will turn out.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not bad, but this one obviously was out in the sun too long.	CHITCHAT
Here's one that was made 100 hundred years ago, 'cause that's the color scheme I'm getting from this one, you know, but I really like beach for.	CHITCHAT
And we'll just change it back to it.	CHITCHAT
And I'd say This is looking pretty darn Good.	CHITCHAT
Jessica, thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Everybody Megan.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much guys.	CHITCHAT
You guys are awesome but this is what I'd go for.	CHITCHAT
Something kind of like this, right?	CHITCHAT
I really like the colors.	CHITCHAT
Let's hit F couple times and that's what we have for at least the coloring book, right?	CHITCHAT
So to kind of even recap.	CHITCHAT
We started here where did we start?	CHITCHAT
We started with something like this which is our color are outlined drawing.	CHITCHAT
Tried some different brushes, some different colors, right?	CHITCHAT
I started to outline all the brushes as well and then we ended up with this one.	CHITCHAT
So you get the idea cool.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully guys like that.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for sharing as well.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for sharing time with me and I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT

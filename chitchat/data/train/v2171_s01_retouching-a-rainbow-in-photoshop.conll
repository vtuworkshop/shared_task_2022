The standard LA to do so you can see that's the before and the after.	O
There you go, and so whenever we're going to retouch here, we do not re touch with the global colorings on just because it can actually impact your.	O
Your stuff so alright, so I'm going to go ahead.	O
I'm going to rasterize this layer.	O
And I'm going to go ahead an like dive in so a couple of things that I know right off the bat that I definitely want to fix is first of- these little white jobbers here.	O
Now you guys are probably wondering what in the world what in the hey, hey is that, UM?	CHITCHAT
So whenever I was creating this paper thing I thought I would be really cool to have tabs on this side here.	O
That I could glue this light onto the problem is and I understand that this is really dark for you guys, so I wonder if I can.	O
Just up this just so you can kind of see what I'm what I'm looking at.	O
OK.	O
I'm so.	CHITCHAT
Essentially, I thought I would have these tabs to glue the light onto.	O
It didn't workout, so I ended up cutting the tabs off, but you can't see the tab is because in some places the light is.	O
Obscuring But unfortunately in this reflection it is reflecting the bot the bot like underneath of this and that's why you can see it and so therefore it's not working out very well.	O
So we're going to go ahead and we're going to clean up.	O
That and all I'm doing is that I'm hitting the UM.	O
The stamp tool.	O
Write a stamp or clone tool.	O
So I use those words interchangeably.	O
I could also push J, which is my shortcut, but it's so big for my heel tool.	O
And generally speaking, those in the tool tools that I use a lot a lot a lot a lot.	O
Now if you guys are wondering what in the world are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Um so i'ma paper Crafter.	CHITCHAT
And photographer so that means I make still life still lifes.	CHITCHAT
I don't know lives with F with a VI don't know.	CHITCHAT
Anyway I make still life imagery um and it's used for a variety of reasons.	O
So this particular image right here is just for the giggles.	O
But I'm actually.	O
This rainbow is part of a larger piece.	O
I want a soft.	O
I want it to be very soft.	O
I'm going to decrease the opacity.	O
So what I'm doing now is I'm getting rid of the double stick tape.	O
So one of the things being attacked while illustrator or a paper illustrator is that you have to figure out like what can you glue on top of.	O
What kind of glue do you use to glue certain things together?	CHITCHAT
Obviously, most times I use just like a regular old tacky glue because you know, I'm going paper on paper.	O
Well, in this instance I'm gluing plastic, but this plastic is very mouldable's, very bendable.	O
So what do I use there?	CHITCHAT
and I used about three different glues, right?	CHITCHAT
I want to three.	CHITCHAT
I use three different glues an all of them sucked, so therefore I ended up a used hot glue, tacky glue and then a super glue.	O
Oh and then, uh, plastic cement like specifically for plastic and it didn't work whatsoever.	O
So then at that juncture I went to double stick tape and double stick tape actually was like the bomb.	O
An you can get double stick tape and like a lot of different thicknesses.	O
So I got.	CHITCHAT
I think this one is like 1/4 of an inch.	O
And it clean things up really well for me.	O
But the problem is is this is obviously.	O
The light was I think it's 1.25.	O
I don't know what that is.	CHITCHAT
It's not 1/4 of an inch.	O
It's less than that is half less than that.	O
So that's like an eighth.	O
That's an 8.	O
So it's a Nathan of inch.	O
All right, yeah?	CHITCHAT
So I go ahead.	CHITCHAT
I always edit on a different layer, so I duplicate that layer.	O
Hey.	CHITCHAT
Please do more paper more lives about papercraft photo treatment.	CHITCHAT
Oh girl, I am with you.	CHITCHAT
I am here so thank you so much.	CHITCHAT

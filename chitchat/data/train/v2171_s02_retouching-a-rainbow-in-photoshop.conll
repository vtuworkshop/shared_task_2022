It's Mariana.	CHITCHAT
So pretty.	CHITCHAT
I like that name Mariana.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so if you go back and you look at them, I pass streams.	CHITCHAT
You'll see that I did some of.	O
Actually putting together papercraft, so I'll have those two as well, and I've also have somewhere I photographed it, so I'll show you guys like how I go about in photographing everything I wanted to share, like how to photograph like how I went about and photographed this one.	O
However, it was such a pain in the butt because it was so experimental.	CHITCHAT
And because I had to do it at night that I didn't think that it would be.	CHITCHAT
Very well live streamed.	CHITCHAT
And so one of the reasons for that is it has to be at night is because this light is a continuous light and continuous lighting is not as bright as strobes Watt so ever, and so at that point I literally have to photograph in near darkness.	O
In order to be able to control the light so this particular image is how many lights did I have on it.	O
So I had the strobe I think is one, and then I have another one coming in from camera right, which was jailed pink and then I had another one from camera left up high, which is what is illuminating here.	O
So there is.	O
Why is your?	CHITCHAT
Why you think pending?	CHITCHAT
I can approve it.	CHITCHAT
I'll approve your comment.	CHITCHAT
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
That's so weird.	CHITCHAT
I hadn't like pending.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for this.	CHITCHAT
Live in the previous ones on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you are welcome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't necessarily.	CHITCHAT
Uh, do the retouching stuff on Instagram anymore.	CHITCHAT
Largely because they don't really have time, unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
OK, and So what I'm using right now is I'm using a my stamp tool.	O
I have my flow at 100% but I have my opacity down.	O
Till like 70% and I have the softest edge that I can an I have a welcome tablet so I have a lot of control here.	O
But I am going to increase US hardness just a little bit and pretty much just this.	O
Uh, no.	CHITCHAT
Unseemly seem is what I'm cleaning up.	O
So yeah, I think it's really interesting.	CHITCHAT
So whenever I'm retouching here.	O
I'll share with you guys what not just photoshopped, but look I have a dead pixel in my camera.	O
That's alright, I can just easily do that.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to replace my camera shutter.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, but I will talk about whatever you guys want really, so if there's if you guys are interested in paper crafting and like how this specific thing was built, or perhaps even like photographing, like, how would I go about photographing this thing?	O
I'm like all in.	O
And then you can see over here on the left hand side of this light.	O
There is definite tape edge happening and that's the double sided tape the double sided.	O
Tape that I don't necessarily like.	O
But it's definitely a really.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go ahead and try the J here.	O
And when I say Jay, I mean the.	O
The heel tool.	O
'cause I don't want to get rid of.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I have to keep approving your comments for some reason.	CHITCHAT
Mariana OK photographing.	CHITCHAT
Please please please please yes girl.	CHITCHAT
OK I got you.	CHITCHAT
You know what I actually had some really good feedback on the photograph.	CHITCHAT
The live streaming the photograph on the photography session.	CHITCHAT
So I will definitely see if I can do that more for you guys.	CHITCHAT
The only problem that I'm seeing their uhm.	CHITCHAT
The only problem that I'm seeing with that is that a lot of it has to use live view, right?	CHITCHAT
And so I use capture one for that.	CHITCHAT
And that's not technically in Adobe product, and from what I understand light room does not have live viewing, which is like pretty much like a must have.	CHITCHAT
2.	CHITCHAT
And the way that I photograph.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so this is where I'm super loving the heel tool because I don't want a sharp edge because of this light situation and the heel tool.	O

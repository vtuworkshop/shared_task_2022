What the Hill to tool does is that it takes the pixels from where you want it from.	O
Putting it into where it where you want it to go, but assessing and analyzing all the information of where you're inserting it and will blend it in as closely as it can.	O
But when it does that, it's not creating a a hard line because it's blending right?	O
And so that's why you kind of see.	O
There's like glow that's happening and I am all for that with this.	O
Because light has glows in feathers and no.	O
Sharp lines and less, of course it is a hard light, but we can talk about the difference between hard light and soft light.	O
Whenever we do the live photographing sessions.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're getting into.	CHITCHAT
I just want to blend this a little bit more.	O
Alright, we're getting into where the light was reflecting.	O
The double stick tape.	O
And so that just looks hideous.	O
So anyway, the what I ended up using to photograph this, so let me zoom out again so you guys can see what I'm talking about.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So believe it or not, this was I used flashlights.	O
This is these are just like cheapie flashlights.	O
I think I bought them for a workshop.	CHITCHAT
Actually I know I bought these workshop.	CHITCHAT
Um, these flashlights for a workshop and I got like.	CHITCHAT
30 of them, in a bundle or something ridiculous like that, and they are like insanely cheap, insanely cheap, so you don't have to have good gear.	CHITCHAT
You just have to understand what their gear does.	CHITCHAT
And then from there you can really manipulate what you want it to do so.	CHITCHAT
I used gels in order to color my light now.	O
In my workshop I I have people use tissue paper.	O
My color tissue paper, which you can totally use that to color gels.	O
I've also had people use their now Jean bottles or their drinking bottles.	O
Whatever you know, water bottles that they have on hand.	O
That's a color they'll use that to color their lights.	O
And you can also balance color as well, so I'm a paper crafter, right?	CHITCHAT
And so I have almost every color under the sun.	CHITCHAT
As you can imagine in like different color papers and so.	CHITCHAT
With that said.	CHITCHAT
You can just put the light towards the color paper and the light will take that color from that paper and bounce it on to your subject, which is why whenever you're next to a red wall, you then become red when you take that picture, it's all about bouncing and so light is really, really, really really friendly.	O
It's very color friendly.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
So it's definitely cleaning up already pretty nicely.	O
Some somehow along the way.	CHITCHAT
I duplicated my layer.	O
I keep doing that.	O
I don't necessarily know how I'm doing that, but I am OK.	CHITCHAT
So in this again is just a personal project, so I am actually I did create this rainbow for.	CHITCHAT
A project so you guys will see this later Alright and so now I'm going into digital painting a little bit because I want this to be this like dark blue.	O
I'm not getting it, however, and it's probably because my point size is actually too big, but we will see that.	O
Alright, so I'm going to go to where is my eyedropper tool.	O
I can't say it.	CHITCHAT
Hey Cody, good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Also guys Cody also live stream so she's been doing it I think since last week I think you started.	CHITCHAT
I went and Hey Cara Cara live streams too.	CHITCHAT
So woo to live stream buddies.	CHITCHAT
So Cody does this really awesome fun illustration style as she was doing like a punk Kitty I think is the one that I like which I really super love that I got to jump in on.	CHITCHAT

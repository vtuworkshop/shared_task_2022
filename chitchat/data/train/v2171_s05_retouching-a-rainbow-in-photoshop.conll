All right, we're going to just do negative one colladay negative one.	O
Alright cool, So what I'm doing is I'm just changing the angle of my canvas so whenever I am.	O
Barring these pixels.	O
2.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much color over this.	O
It's matching the angle 'cause I know you guys have probably been in this situation before where you're doing this and you're like, Oh man, why is it not?	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I can see my overlay.	O
Show overlay let's do.	O
60%.	O
Why it does not like me?	CHITCHAT
60%, not six.	O
That would be horrible.	CHITCHAT
Alright, cool and then we're going to do negative 50 just so to make sure.	O
Like can we can we see that?	CHITCHAT
You guys probably can't see this.	CHITCHAT
This is like so small.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Go back to 100 in color day.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So, and I'm going to turn this on a Nov so you can see that it's definitely clearing it up and what I'm doing is I'm borrowing the pixels from the bottom an adding him to the top so it's not messing up.	O
There you go.	O
Just cleaning that up.	O
Now see you can see how now it's kind of like.	O
Diverging a little bit, so it needs to go counterclockwise.	O
A little bit, so my overlay I want you to be negative two now and I'm going to undo this.	O
And then we're just we're going to go back.	O
And clean this up.	O
There it goes.	O
Alrighty alrighty oh.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now we're getting more angled, so I'm going to do negative four.	O
I'm just doing increments of two just so I can like keep track of it, because if I don't do some quantitative like measured.	O
Changes.	O
For us too much, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I will lose track.	CHITCHAT
And it's really helpful to realize that, like negative is counterclockwise.	O
And positive is clockwise.	O
I don't know why, but it took me a really long time to put those things together and so it stopped being so much of a uhm.	CHITCHAT
Like, surprise kind of going like I wonder what happened this time.	CHITCHAT
Alright, and so because I'm gonna go glutton for punishment once again.	CHITCHAT
That no, I was going to see if I could digitally paint it.	CHITCHAT
I just like sometimes digitally painting things a lot better than.	CHITCHAT
'cause I feel like I have control.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to zoom out and see.	O
I'm gonna put that in a group.	O
Actually, I put that in the group to what happened.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm not done with the tape, but that edge.	O
Is much better.	O
And that's before and after the edge.	O
The edge just kind of flared out a little bit.	O
I didn't like it an I wanted ahead and did the same tool on a different layer.	O
So if I didn't like it I could delete it, but I like it.	O
So now I'm just going to go ahead and merge the group.	O
All right, and then I'm going to go ahead an with my heel tool.	O
Keep going.	O
With creating a softer edge right here.	O
OK.	O
Bam, bam bam for barrel.	CHITCHAT
Burn, burn burn fan fan fan fan for barrel.	CHITCHAT
I need music.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, I'm saying to you.	CHITCHAT
Now I can't even releasing poor you, and nor can I rhyme songs.	CHITCHAT
As I'm singing to you, I'll stop.	CHITCHAT
All right, so you can see definitely this like blend action that's happening here that I was talking about.	O

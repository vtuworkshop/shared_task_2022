With the heel tool.	O
But what I do quite literally is that I just go over it over and over and over again.	O
Now I could have totally stamped it with a lower opacity, which is what?	O
I'll do right now 70% I'll go down to like.	O
39 And it pretty much just kind of speeds it up a little bit.	O
But I'll go back to the hit my J in order to.	O
Clean it up.	O
Alright, so this is this white right here is going to bother me.	O
All right, So what I'm going to do?	CHITCHAT
As I'm going to borrow those pixels from right underneath it, I'd still in doing current and below.	O
I don't want to do that.	O
I don't want to get the stuff from underneath it.	O
Alright, carie that horror is encouraging me that you like my singing, that seems.	CHITCHAT
That you don't want.	CHITCHAT
You don't want you don't encourage that.	CHITCHAT
Just say.	CHITCHAT
There's some things worth encouraging.	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, so I have this really fun rainbow project.	CHITCHAT
This is a personal.	CHITCHAT
This is like so I took the prop from the project that I'm actually supposed to be working on.	CHITCHAT
Sorry and decided to make something thanks, Cody.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, so yeah, so decided to make something.	CHITCHAT
Surely for fun just because.	CHITCHAT
I mean I had the prop and I super love the prop and so I wanted to but The thing is, is that like?	CHITCHAT
So it was two fold a.	CHITCHAT
I got to make something that I normally probably wouldn't have because I had the prop.	CHITCHAT
So I'm really thankful for that.	CHITCHAT
But be it also gave me an opportunity to practice lighting something with this particular light source, because I've never.	CHITCHAT
I've never done it before.	CHITCHAT
And so that's what I really like about personal projects.	CHITCHAT
And if you guys aren't doing one, I would definitely suggest in doing one regardless of what time or what's going on in life.	CHITCHAT
So meaning like I know, a lot of people were saying like we're right now is the perfect time to do personal projects.	CHITCHAT
Well, that kind of depends upon the person that depends upon how you know whatever coping mechanism really works for you.	CHITCHAT
So for me I do personal projects regardless of what's happening in my circumstances.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And that's largely because.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a cope.	CHITCHAT
It's a coping mechanism for life for me, um.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I mean like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I can't.	CHITCHAT
I can't tell you when I didn't have a personal project always going on the side just because it's I get to pick what I want to create.	CHITCHAT
I get to be the art director.	CHITCHAT
I get to be the creative director and I think it's really fun whenever you get to pull on your friends to be in that scenario as well, you get to join.	CHITCHAT
They get to join you.	CHITCHAT
You know, if you're doing a collaboration and so, anyway, I definitely, I definitely encourage it.	CHITCHAT
Just because I feel like there's things that you would explore and you would learn that you wouldn't learn otherwise.	CHITCHAT
And then you can take those things that you learn so.	CHITCHAT
An apply him to whatever new ventures you're going to have.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this right here is definitely a really difficult Patch for me to Freehand, so I'm just going to stop trying to free hand and I'm going to do what I probably should have done from the beginning.	O
I do this all the time I tried to freehand things and then realize you know, you just.	O
You just really kind of need to, you know, pony up and outline the Dang thing.	O
So that is what I'm going to be doing is that I am outlining.	O
This with the pen tool.	O
Now the problem is, is my pin tool line is blue and what I'm trying to outline is blue.	O
So it's so hard I can't see you.	CHITCHAT
I can't see you lying where are you?	CHITCHAT
My daughter today.	CHITCHAT
They have to do.	CHITCHAT
Home schooling right because of everything going on and so one of the assignments was that that she was going to have to teach the class how to do this.	CHITCHAT

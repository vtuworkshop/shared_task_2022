Multiplication tables so she got her white board out and she was like OK.	CHITCHAT
I write class today we're going to be doing 22 * 11.	CHITCHAT
And she just like just hodgepodge this amazing accent.	CHITCHAT
And I was I was there for it.	CHITCHAT
Bravo Eva Weld zones or Lang and I think the problem is I'm watching good place right now so that problems only being exacerbated because of.	CHITCHAT
Her name is not Tamale.	CHITCHAT
What is her name?	CHITCHAT
I don't know, I don't know, but the the beautiful Sky rises.	CHITCHAT
As a Christian bells character calls, are You Beautiful Sky rise would legs or something like that so funny.	CHITCHAT
OK so I got I am.	CHITCHAT
So I did this and it's just looking kind of crazy.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, so I'm just getting it kind of closed and then we're going to do is like exactly what I did last time that I showed you guys.	O
So I'm getting a new layer an I'm going to definitely do some digital painting here, but on a new layer because I don't want to mess up anything that's actually good that's happening, so I'm going to decrease my floanne my opacity and I'm going to.	O
Hold down the eye as Kara told me to, um.	CHITCHAT
I guess I'm going to go to a 11 by 11 average OK, and so there I go.	O
I'm gonna go to my brush and I'm just going to well, what's happening?	O
Oh I know what's happening.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so now I have to kind of go dark, so this is what's happening.	O
Is that this is a lot darker than what you guys are seeing because I up the.	O
Up the levels so you guys could see it 'cause it was.	O
It's definitely really dark right here an.	O
Whenever you go and you pick up the eyedropper for some reason, it picks up.	O
I mean I get it, but it's picking up the UM.	O
The color from the OR not color?	O
What do you call it the tonality from that's changing because of the curves.	O
That's what I mean.	CHITCHAT
OK alright, so anyway you can kind of see, so I turned it off and on so I'm just gonna kind of pick some of the colors behind it.	O
I'm like making it blend in a little bit and you guys are probably wondering like.	O
Alicia, that like cool from a tonality standpoint.	O
Colors like it's blending really well, but like that texture is so different.	O
What are you going to do?	CHITCHAT
Well, I will tell you friend.	CHITCHAT
I am going to go to filter 'cause you guys can't see you when I'm doing alright.	O
I'm going to go to noise.	O
I'm going to add noise.	O
Um and this is where I should just share my whole entire screen because like I have this add noise like pop up window and you can't see it.	O
Oh BS.	O
OBSOBS What does OBS stands for?	O
Oreos before Spaghetti.	CHITCHAT
Oreos before alright.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just playing around with like the level of.	O
Noise that I want to happen here 9 is a little bit too much.	O
Two is looking pretty good.	O
I would have to say I think 2 is going to be the magic number.	O
OK, what is the next thing that she's gonna do up?	CHITCHAT
She's going up to filter clicking that button.	O
It's going to blur.	O
Gaussian blur is the choice.	O
She did Passover box smart blur.	O
Also field blur that one I'm sure was alright and so anyway.	O
So now what I'm doing is I am decreasing.	O
I'm playing around with the blur.	O
And so you can kind of see now that the blur it stretching those noises out and so then at that juncture it's starting to blend in a little bit more.	O
So .7 is currently where I'm at.	O
I'm wondering if you know six makes it a little bit pronounced a is going to make it a little bit more soft.	O
Yeah so.	CHITCHAT
Or I can do that and then at that point there you go.	O
And so I deselected it and so you can kind of see now.	O
It just really kind of blends in there really, really, really well.	O

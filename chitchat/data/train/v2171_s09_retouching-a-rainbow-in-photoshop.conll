So I'm not person that like if something even remotely reminds me of a song I will just go into it and so at one point I had a studio mate and she was the same way and we would just bust out in like random songs and it was really awesome and we also really had a huge affinity for UM parks and rec and so at any point we could sing anything like John Rafia we did.	CHITCHAT
We also really liked 90s rap, so things just got really weird often and I wouldn't have it any other way and I miss you, Katie.	CHITCHAT

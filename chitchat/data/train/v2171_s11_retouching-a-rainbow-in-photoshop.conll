Golly, Gee Alright, so I need to do point.	O
Alright, I Point sample, it is important sample.	O
It's because I'm in curves, that's why.	O
Telling you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, back to brush.	O
OK what what the hey hey happened to my lasso.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Again, I'm going to do this on a different layer.	O
OK, so I got my.	CHITCHAT
There you go and I'm just coloring it an.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just going to do all my digital painting on this particular layer while I'm cleaning these things up.	O
So whenever I go back and I do all of my.	CHITCHAT
Whenever I go back and I do all of my filters.	O
To kind of make this.	O
Clean.	O
Like the textures match, I can just do it all on like 1 go.	O
Alright, so now I'm just cleaning up this bottom line.	O
OK, and that's going to stamp tool, but remember you can do current layers in below.	O
I'm just going to clean that up.	O
I love the lasso tool.	O
It is by far and like their last year tool with the ability to um like combine things like to unify edges.	O
'cause up here I don't know if you guys see that, but there are pathfinders tools pretty much with your lasso and what you can do.	O
Which I Super Super Love an use it quite often.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Is an which actually I might end up using here alright so.	O
There we go alright.	O
So I created this whole entire like selection.	O
OK obviously it's too big.	O
I need to subtract the bottom half of this laptop.	O
But The thing is is at the bottom half the laptop has actually a softer edge than the top part, so I went ahead and selected the whole thing with a one pixel.	O
With a one pixel.	O
Feather edge, but now I'm going to subtract the bottom.	O
With two pixel.	O
Boo Boo.	CHITCHAT
And I know like I have this little Dingle Berry over here, but doesn't bother me 'cause I'm not going to be over there.	O
And so now at this juncture my top pixel.	O
My top is going to be a little bit more.	O
Firms in the bottom the bottom is going to be a little bit softer.	O
Alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
And so again, just digitally painting over that it is going to for sure.	O
Stand out until I add that and make that texture a little bit better, but you can definitely see.	O
Just let me turn that on.	O
You can see just how nice that kind of cleans it up and makes it a little bit more pronounced.	O
OK, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Are there any other wrinkles or anything that I need to clean up while I'm here?	O
I'm just going to J it also known as.	O
He'll tool.	O
Here too, the full.	O
I don't know I was trying, I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I completely understand if my sense of humor is not aligned with yours.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool, so now we have this seem that we definitely need to clean up, so I'm going to.	O
Grab my source.	O
And just kind of go down.	O
Now I don't know if you guys know this difference between the heel to land the stamp tool, but where your source stays.	O
So like for instance.	O
I got my source here at the the.	O
The transition between the pink in the blue OK and you can see.	O
So I'm holding my cursor straight.	O
The Circle is where I'm putting the pixels into.	O
The plus sign is where the pixels are coming from.	O
OK now I can go over here to again the green and the pink, so I've moved slightly to the left hand side.	O
But notice where my pixels are coming from has not changed.	O
That would be completely different if this was the stamp tool.	O
If there was the stamp tool, what's happening is that the distance between the cursor and the point from which the pixels are coming from maintains the distance, no matter where you are in the canvas.	O
So for instance.	O

If I go, I'm still in heel tulan I'm working over here.	O
Notice that my plus sign is still where the original intake from those pixels are, so that's like that's actually pretty nuanced, but.	O
A very important detail to know.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So fun fact, I started using Photoshop when there was only one layer.	CHITCHAT
It was crazy and I remember then 'cause we were learning how you know previous to this, the Photoshop or the graphic design was created out of like cutting a whole bunch of different things up and or like printing them on like a transparency or like whatever and compiling everything and then like taking a huge photo of it.	CHITCHAT
That that was.	CHITCHAT
The way to do graphic design so it's really funny.	CHITCHAT
That the way that I used to do graphic design now is like the way that people were like or like Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
I can't believe You used to have photo shop file with only one layer, the travesty.	CHITCHAT
That's fine, you know what we pretty much did is that we just saved it to our floppy disk, not actually know.	CHITCHAT
We saved it to our CD ROM because it was rewritable baby.	CHITCHAT
So I could just save over it if I needed to.	CHITCHAT
But that sucked like just just like in college and being in the computer Department and then having to save out your files.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
That was horrible.	CHITCHAT
It took forever.	CHITCHAT
I'm showing my age and that is fine.	CHITCHAT
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
All right, hey, that looks a little bit better.	O
I don't really Mark Iliji my I'm like I keep moving things and it's bothering me.	O
That's bothering me.	O
We definitely I don't like how there's like these weird like dark tones in here so I am pretty much trying just to even them out a 60% that's not really going to work so I'm going to go back down to like 24.	O
not I just picked blow 24.	O
Just happens to be where I landed.	O
It's not like 24 is the magical number.	O
Alicia did it on 24 so I have to do 24% Opacity to no no friends.	O
You just just do whatever works for you.	O
I'm just lazy.	CHITCHAT
OK, that looks better.	O
All right, now we need to clean up this wrinkle.	O
And what I like about this is.	O
Meaning when I say this I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
Again, this is just a personal image that I created, but with a commissioned prop.	O
And so I haven't done the Commission photo yet, however sorry, I guess perhaps I should be working on that.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
What I like about this though, is that it's showing me all the things that I know that I'm going to need to Retouch.	O
When it comes to the final image.	O
OK so I can tell that I'm going to need to paint this so you can see it's a lot different when you turn that curve Zopf.	O
So I'm quite literally just.	CHITCHAT
I just quite literally just you know, painted on top of it.	O
I turned the curves back on just to kind of see if it's blending well.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
So B is your shortcut for brush.	O
And I have 100% opacity here, so there's like no blending of colors that I mean I have a bit of a flow, but.	O
Speaking of flow, I'm not a very good karaoke artist.	CHITCHAT
Just so you guys know, alright cool.	CHITCHAT
So I did.	CHITCHAT
That does kind of like.	CHITCHAT
That's pretty standee Audi.	O
From a.	O
Colour standpoint or like a texture standpoint?	O
I understand you can barely see what's happening here, but I mean like just kind of shows you the level of.	O

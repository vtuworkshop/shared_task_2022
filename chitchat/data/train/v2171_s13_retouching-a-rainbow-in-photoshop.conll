Green ality that we get into.	O
OK.	O
Yeah, I'm not really liking you.	O
Can definitely see like this double shadow here.	O
I'm just I'm not liking it.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to go ahead and.	O
Clean that up.	O
So again, I'm doing my stamp tool, but I'm doing it on a completely different layer other than the one that I am.	O
That has my main art on it.	O
And the way that I'm doing that is by having my current in below selected.	O
Cool, so that is definitely looking a lot better.	O
Right, and you know what I'm going to do.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go to lighten.	O
And my blend.	O
And this might be a little bit too light nice.	O
So essentially what's happening now is that I'm laying down those pixels an in doing that is just lining them.	O
'cause it's that darkness that I'm trying to get rid of.	O
Alright, let's.	CHITCHAT
Ah man, somehow I jumped.	O
To doing it on the actual artwork.	O
Dagnab E.	CHITCHAT
Headed out AH, thank you so much for Cara for joining me man.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate you girly.	CHITCHAT
OK, and I do need to finish up this image.	O
So I think we're just going to have to go with some of these things that I'm not really a fan of.	O
Just understanding that, like.	CHITCHAT
I got paying projects.	CHITCHAT
I need to get to.	CHITCHAT
But this is annoying me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's just move on.	CHITCHAT
I gotta move on.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Stamp Tool.	O
Cleaning that up.	O
OK, I think that's.	CHITCHAT
OK, I need to go to normal reset.	O
I wish there was like a quick button that you could do to reset.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know if this exist so if it exists and you know about it, let let's girl no.	CHITCHAT
But I would love to know like if I go back to the brush tool for instance like I just got done doing some digital painting and so it has like those presets to it.	CHITCHAT
But like let's say I want to.	CHITCHAT
Let's say I want to change them.	CHITCHAT
How could I do that?	CHITCHAT
That would be pretty awesome.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool, now let's look at just wondering.	O
Like this is looking little blotchy, but maybe that's fine.	O
I can see you can barely see it, but I can see a a dead pixel, but be the line from the.	O
I'm going to hit J, which is my.	O
Clue not clued my heel tool?	O
And there we go.	O
OK.	O
That cleaned up quite nicely.	O
Alright, so I'm going to.	O
Mega that darker again and I'm turning on my global went turn on my.	O
A little bit too bright for me.	O
Ah, and I think that's I think I think we're close.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
I didn't do my filter, so I'm going to go ahead an.	O
Do my noise now.	O
I do have a action that does all this for me.	O
However, if I do the action.	O
I don't have the benefit of like talking you guys through what I'm doing.	O
OK, sweet.	O
All right, now go back into play with these colors.	O
Nice alright, so I am not liking.	O
The pinks.	O
Which I don't know.	O
I know I added the pinks in there in the photo.	O
Yeah, that's right.	O
I'm not liking not so I'm gonna throw away this.	O

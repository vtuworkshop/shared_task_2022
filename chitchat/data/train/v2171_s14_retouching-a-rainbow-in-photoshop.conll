So this stuff I did Saturday night really super late.	CHITCHAT
I was super tired.	CHITCHAT
Don't really understand why I did this.	CHITCHAT
Why did a lot of these things OK, sweet?	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to go through my selective colors really quick and just see like what did I do I don't remember what I did I don't play with science.	O
There's a lot of Science in this photo.	CHITCHAT
Also, a lot of like.	O
Blues, YouTube Ilike that we can we don't keep that the little punchy punch is.	O
Oh, I like lighting that up too.	O
'cause I was looking at the image that I have so like I still have it like put up and that background is actually more of a sea foam.	O
I kind of like it darker.	O
Is more of a sea foam and I was thinking man, I kind of missed the same foam and I know it's me messing with the Blacks.	O
Well, that's trippy.	CHITCHAT
Ha, anyway want lime.	CHITCHAT
No, we don't want lime.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
That's fun, I know that that's not really what we're going for, but that definitely has a vibe to it.	CHITCHAT
An I'm I'm here for it, but it's not.	CHITCHAT
It's not really what we're doing here.	CHITCHAT
That's also pretty fun.	CHITCHAT
OK, and then let's go to whites and I played with white.	O
So no, I didn't.	O
There really isn't much white in this photo.	O
If I played with Gray, there would be a lot of changes right now.	O
So we will go we let's go venture to Gray.	O
See Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Which I mean, I just keep thinking like maybe playing with the yellows might be nice.	O
No, alright, I'm going to go to 0.	O
Whoa no 00.	O
Alright, let's add a little bit of yellow.	O
I like I like the little depth of that yellow, making it a little bit darker.	O
OK, cool, alright?	CHITCHAT
So we're going to do is I'm going to turn it all off so we can see specifically what's happening.	O
OK, so right now this is actually how darker images, but as soon as we put this curves on it, this curves all this curve is is just increasing the overall midtones.	O
It's all it's doing OK 'cause then I have another curves right here that adds a bit more of.	O
A actually, this one is a bit more of an S curve, so you can see Oh no you guys can't see the histogram are.	O
If I put it here, you can see the histogram.	O
There goes alright, so over here on the right hand side you guys should be able to see that you are a couple seconds behind me.	O
OK so anyway so we have one that one curves that increases the midtones.	O
We have another curves that's a bit of an S curve in order to create a bit of that pop.	O
So then on top of that, what I ended up doing is adding a little bit of the light coming from the.	O
The computer.	O
Now I do have it kind of low.	O
I can make him a little bit more brighter.	O
I think that's nice.	O
OK, and then from there I wanted to play around with the the last two colors.	O
Here the blue are not the blue, the purple and the Orange.	O
I just wanted to be a little bit more warm so went ahead and adjusted those in the mass.	O
Those out from last time.	O
And then with the colors just a lot of colors that would kind of like just switched and an massage to nuanced.	O
And then of course I messed around with the color balance in order to kind of just like make some of those even more rich an pop out.	O
So there you go.	O
There is the final image, so let's go ahead and group all this good stuff.	O
So that's before.	O
And this is after.	O
Before.	O
After I feel like one of those like I doctor people that are like, is this better or is this better one or two?	CHITCHAT
So anyway, I super appreciate you guys spending time with me today.	CHITCHAT

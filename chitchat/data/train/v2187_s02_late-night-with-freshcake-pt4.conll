We've been doing that a couple of times tonight.	CHITCHAT
And if you're a little confused as to what's going on, it's all good.	CHITCHAT
We had some crashes so you're going to miss a lot of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Go back to the replace, watch him part one Part 2 Part 3.	CHITCHAT
Those will all be up later tonight and definitely by tomorrow morning.	CHITCHAT
You can go back through.	CHITCHAT
You can watch him.	CHITCHAT
And get caught up to speed on what you missed.	CHITCHAT
I'm having some Internet Internet issues tonight, so that's why we're kind of.	CHITCHAT
You know, you're catching the stream sort of jumped ahead here a little bit.	CHITCHAT
And Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's pretty much the spiel.	CHITCHAT
For everybody.	CHITCHAT
So just letting colors by tapping on the screen and and holding so you just go, you find a color you tap, you hold it gives you larger.	O
Or you can drag it all over.	O
You can select what you need.	O
We got large Marge headed to yeah definitely from Jersey Shore.	CHITCHAT
She's like head to Atlantic City right now.	CHITCHAT
That's where large Marge is going.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
How long have you been streaming?	CHITCHAT
How long have I been streaming?	CHITCHAT
I started streaming.	CHITCHAT
OK so I started streaming for Behance when this whole thing first opened up and that was October.	CHITCHAT
Actually I just looked at this today that was October 28th.	CHITCHAT
That was the actual start date of my streams.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what day my first stream ever was on.	CHITCHAT
But That was the that that was kind of like.	CHITCHAT
That was like around when I first got like OBS on my computer and set everything up and you know.	CHITCHAT
Now that would be my first dream.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think back and look through.	CHITCHAT
I had a couple streams that I deleted early on 'cause they were terrible.	CHITCHAT
So off to dig back through that 'cause that might have been the first one.	CHITCHAT
'cause I know like when you when you sign up to do this thing, you have to send like a like a mock stream of yourself.	CHITCHAT
I know Jack you're familiar with that and it was definitely mine was done October like a little bit before.	CHITCHAT
I think that stream is still on here actually that would have been a few days before the 28th when I like really got into it.	CHITCHAT
So we had some detail in there.	CHITCHAT
You have to tune in your going to tune in 50 times.	CHITCHAT
Alright well, sorry this room crash soon and 50 Times Now here we go I'll be back.	CHITCHAT
I actually have the discord closed on the background right now, 'cause I'm afraid that maybe that's kind of jacking it up.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why that would jacket out, but you never know too many programs running or something, so trying to run as like I got like a skeleton crew running over here.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so large Marge got some frizzed out here.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Gotta say though, I really enjoy streaming on my hands man.	CHITCHAT
It's cool community.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of people.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I've been over hands for a long time like before the streaming.	CHITCHAT
But I never posted really actively, which I need to post some new gallery's.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there's a person named Sarah were saying Hey to her.	CHITCHAT
We like her work loving this.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for sharing to work.	CHITCHAT
Oh no problem, sorry Sarah, I totally missed your comment.	CHITCHAT
I apologize, I didn't mean to.	CHITCHAT
I try to keep up with the chat as much as I can with these things and.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you miss stuff, so I apologize if I do alright.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some shading to large Marge, she's bright man, but you know what?	O
That fits large Marge.	O
She's a colorful character.	O
Alright, so you know the drill for shading.	O
I make a new layer and I lower the Opacity and I choose the color of my line work, which is this purple.	O
Alright, let's do some shading.	O
So we just kind of trace along now.	O
I should mention in this version of Frisco there is a clipping mask feature that you can use.	O
I can show you that really quick if you make a new layer and then you hit this little toggle right here with the little down arrow and then you can kind of draw inside your shapes which is really cool.	O
You can make patterns and stuff like that and Mary, I don't necessarily need it for what I'm doing right now, but I might use that for the highlight work will see.	O
Right, so let's let's see.	CHITCHAT
We did the ear.	O
Let me totally honest with everyone.	CHITCHAT
I am not in the back of my head that this translator crash and I keep checking like religiously right now.	CHITCHAT
It seems like there's a lot more people TuneIn.	CHITCHAT
If you are new to the stream just so you know, there have been some tech errors tonight so we've had some technical difficulties with the stream goes down.	CHITCHAT
I will bring it back up.	CHITCHAT
I will not stop doing that until this illustration is complete and I give a proper sign off.	CHITCHAT
So I'm not going to abandoned anyone.	CHITCHAT

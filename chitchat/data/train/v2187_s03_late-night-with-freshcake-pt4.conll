So if you're watching and the stream cuts out, I apologize.	CHITCHAT
I will be right back.	CHITCHAT
I just want to.	CHITCHAT
Put that out there.	CHITCHAT
And this is our character, large Marge, we're going to do some shading that are all nice and ready for the, for the casinos down in Atlantic City.	O
Swear she's had it tonight.	CHITCHAT
She forgot to wear clothes fairly.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
But in the shade on the hand.	O
Let's do this.	O
Big Blobby shade on the thumb here.	O
I think it needs it.	O
Alright, so anyone again people were new.	CHITCHAT
Anyone returning start their spiel.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I'm doing when I shade so I'm just making this up as they go long but always get like complemented about it so maybe I do know what I'm doing.	O
It's like subconsciously.	O
Like all those years in art school paid off, you know, and I didn't know it.	CHITCHAT
It taught me how to shade.	CHITCHAT
I think we can break the curse.	CHITCHAT
I know it is like a curse.	CHITCHAT
Again, I'm like I become like paranoid that I'm going to be.	CHITCHAT
That's going to be like my thing that's going to be like my Mo as a streamer that go watch that guy who stream crashes regularly.	CHITCHAT
That'll be like Adobe marketing ploy.	CHITCHAT
Hey, do you watch streamers on Twitch while come check out this dude?	CHITCHAT
He crashes all the time.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see here love that left joke about it.	CHITCHAT
I will put in the universe too much.	CHITCHAT
I'm not like that shading.	CHITCHAT
I did alarm.	CHITCHAT
Back a little bit that feels better.	CHITCHAT
I'll be honest, I I'm pretty sure that the crashing is not on Behance aside, I'm positive it's on mine.	CHITCHAT
So off to figure it out.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what happened with my.	CHITCHAT
With My Internet, but it's been acting funky in my house lately, but having some issues.	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Right, so let's choose back leg here.	O
something I want to note.	CHITCHAT
I gotta add some more detail in also want to just kind of bring in some like I started doing this kind of shading trick lately and I really enjoy it.	O
Like adding like really dark kinda like sections.	O
I think it looks really good.	O
Over here.	O
Layer.	O
And we can add machine to this legs.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Here.	O
Nice.	O
Tell.	CHITCHAT
Top.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I don't know if I like this shading on the toe down here.	O

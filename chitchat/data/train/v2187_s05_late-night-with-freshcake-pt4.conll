Here we go.	CHITCHAT
My name is fresh cake.	CHITCHAT
I'm an artist here on the hand so illustrator I draw a lot of fun goofy characters.	CHITCHAT
My styles reminiscent I find of like old 90s cartoons, that kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
We also have a really fun community of like fresh cake followers going.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what to call everybody yet.	CHITCHAT
Like the cake balls.	CHITCHAT
But if you go ahead, you can go.	CHITCHAT
There's a, uh, oh, it looks like I'm kind of lagging out a little bit.	CHITCHAT
If you go down underneath in the chat, there is links to the discord that kind of stuff you can go down there, click on the link to the discord hop in our chat.	CHITCHAT
You can talk to me directly.	CHITCHAT
You can talk to everybody else.	CHITCHAT
We got a lot of fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
There's inspiration, chats.	CHITCHAT
There's share your work.	CHITCHAT
Chats where we do like fun critiques.	CHITCHAT
And then there's also times where I notify you if I'm going to live or not here on my hands.	CHITCHAT
I should also mention I only stream here on my hands, and if you want more fresh cake stuff, go give me a follow on the socials at eat fresh cake on Instagram.	CHITCHAT

Check out the website going back to the work here we are back on the iPad.	CHITCHAT
Cupcakes.	CHITCHAT
Cupcakes are cool cupcakes.	CHITCHAT
Sound cute too.	CHITCHAT
I like that.	CHITCHAT
Like cake balls.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to come up with something for everybody, so we're drawn to some shading here on the hair.	CHITCHAT
And if you are new to the streams, you're going to get hit with a bunch of notifications for some replace for everyone who doesn't who is unaware there was some crashing earlier going on, but we got it fixed and I apologise, so there's a number of streams from this one.	CHITCHAT
There's four to be exact.	CHITCHAT
Go back, watch the replays.	CHITCHAT
You can watch this character get made from start to finish if you don't want to watch all those replace it's OK.	CHITCHAT
Guess what?	CHITCHAT
On Fridays at noon I do a stream where I do a time lapse of all my work.	CHITCHAT
It looks kind of like this.	CHITCHAT
I'll show you I do a time lapse of all my illustrations.	CHITCHAT
So if you don't want to watch those long replace, you want to catch something.	CHITCHAT
You can watch me redraw all the characters in like under 5 minutes.	CHITCHAT
It's something really fun.	CHITCHAT
It's really super cool and you know, I do it on Fridays.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to spoil the rest time lapse 'cause you know I want to keep on drawing for everybody, but this is what they look like, so that's Fridays at noon.	CHITCHAT
I also do another stream it 60 minutes long during the week called happy hour.	CHITCHAT
It happens on Monday and Wednesday, 6:00 PM Eastern Time to tune in.	CHITCHAT
I drink beer.	CHITCHAT
We hang out now who's in?	CHITCHAT
The chat usually has beer.	CHITCHAT
It's a good time, so let's see what's going on here.	CHITCHAT
Oh thanks man.	CHITCHAT
You like my work very much.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
One of the two, depending on which you know.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Oh wait, there are you from Connecticut.	CHITCHAT
'cause that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
If you are whereabouts, let us know.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm from Connecticut.	CHITCHAT
That's where I live.	CHITCHAT
See, Connecticut has cool stuff we got.	CHITCHAT
Artists were not just like all bougie like wealthy.	CHITCHAT
I don't know people feel like everyone thinks of us as Alright.	CHITCHAT
So we got our shading done.	O
We've also got some some detail going on in this thing.	O
I'm going to merge this layer down.	O
We're going to add just a little bit more detail in here.	O
Little little hatch Marks and like the little things, these things kind of matter.	O
I tell the story.	O
I think almost every week about teacher I once had.	O
That's only drawing and saw me do something like this and they're like, oh, 'cause those lines matter.	O
And it was, I thought, was a real jerk.	CHITCHAT
You think the same 'cause they do matter man.	CHITCHAT
It adds texture.	O
It creates more vibe.	O
Another word or highlighting, and we had a little drop shadows character and I think we might be done at that point.	O
Have you ever done a collab with Johnny Cupcakes?	CHITCHAT
I've never done a collab.	CHITCHAT
Johnny Cupcakes.	CHITCHAT
I have been though to the flagship store in Boston and it's funny because if anyone out there is watching is from Boston or has ever been to the flagship store in Boston, they know when you walk in.	CHITCHAT
It's a very tiny room with a giant oven.	CHITCHAT
And here's the catch everybody.	CHITCHAT
The ovens adore.	CHITCHAT
You gotta open the oven to get in the store.	CHITCHAT
It's like on a two way glass thing so you can only see out through the window if you're in the store.	CHITCHAT
I've watched so many people walk in there before.	CHITCHAT
And then realized they think that is just like a pop up shop thing and they don't realize to go through the oven and they walk out.	CHITCHAT
They don't buy any shirts or anything 'cause the stories behind the oven.	CHITCHAT
So if you're in Boston, you go to Johnny Cupcakes flagship store and you're confused when you walk in.	CHITCHAT
Open the oven door.	CHITCHAT
It's not real door, it's going to lead you into the store.	CHITCHAT
Mystic pizza And then a song and like a movie or something I don't remember.	CHITCHAT
Sarah, wait so there are you from Mystic.	CHITCHAT
I'm yet to actually know I've been a mistake.	CHITCHAT
I get to like go though and like really hang out.	CHITCHAT
Is Mystic Pizza really bad?	CHITCHAT
Like really?	CHITCHAT
People like it 'cause you know whatever reason whatever pop culture reference it wasn't.	CHITCHAT

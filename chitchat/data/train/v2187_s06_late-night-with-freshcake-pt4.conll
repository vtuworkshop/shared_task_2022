Mystic pizza delivery guy.	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'll give you a pizza delivery guy one night that be fun.	CHITCHAT
It will do one of the happy hours this week that be cool.	CHITCHAT
Maybe game.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	O
Detail in those extra hairs, large Marge is is getting shelled it up.	O
For a night on the town.	O
Alright, let's add in.	O
Let's add in our highlight, so the way we do highlights I duplicate my layer of my character right.	O
Were duplicate.	O
We're actually going to duplicate again.	O
We're going to duplicate, and there's a reason for that.	O
Were paint bucket.	O
We're going to hit this little toggle we're going to hide these people really quick so we can see very grabber little toggle.	O
We're just going to remove some color.	O
Make sure we have the layer selected.	O
Remove the fill color.	O
Now I know what you're thinking.	CHITCHAT
You're like, why would you do that?	CHITCHAT
You did all that hard work well, it's OK 'cause we need to make the line work.	O
We need to use this to kind of cover up.	O
The highlights.	O
So we're just going to get rid of a lot.	O
A lot of this stuff real quick.	O
Gosh, a character like this animated would be awesome.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if there are still in here she was in here earlier.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to do a.	CHITCHAT
I'll do it.	CHITCHAT
I'll do a stream about how I animate my characters, but I might do a character like this for one of 'em that be really fun.	CHITCHAT
It's a Julia Roberts movie.	CHITCHAT
That's right, that's what it's from.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's awesome.	CHITCHAT
There was a reference here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I want to go my wife's been up there before.	CHITCHAT
For like you know they did like a company trip thing for a job and she really enjoyed it.	CHITCHAT
I've been there with some friends because I went surfing up in Rhode Island and I say that like I served.	CHITCHAT
By the way, I don't surf.	CHITCHAT
My friends went surfing 'cause they surf and they invited me and I want to try but I went surfing up in Rhode Island and it was.	CHITCHAT
It was really fun actually.	CHITCHAT
I would continue surfing if I had a surfboard.	CHITCHAT
By do skateboard.	CHITCHAT
So that's cool, but we went up there.	CHITCHAT
With some friends and stopped in Mystic on the way home for some food.	CHITCHAT
We did not get Misty Pizza.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're going to add some highlights in on this character.	O
We're not going to do the nails just yet.	O
Her shiny nails.	O
I was going to do it, but I think 1st I'm going to do her just the highlights on her body so we take a bright white line and we just kind of trace.	O
And the reason why it's kind of like not drawing on top of the line work is because I made this this layer up here where I got rid of all the filled.	O
So if I remove that you'll see I just drew all over everything.	O
And there's like a random line that I made by accident.	O
OK, there we go, let's restart.	O
Gotta brush and let's just kinda.	O
Let's go at it.	O
It's not good.	O
That's not a good highlight.	O
So I treat this kind of just like I've heard the term room light, which I guess is what it is.	O
Just on the edge of the body, you know.	O
And not across the whole thing, just in certain areas.	O
Just add a little.	O
She knew No.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I would love to do a drink and draw that.	CHITCHAT
Be awesome Sarah.	CHITCHAT
It would be really cool.	CHITCHAT
Oh Kyle, what's up man?	CHITCHAT
Everybody say hi to Kyle He is a very close friend of mine, an roommate from college.	CHITCHAT
It is a financial wizard.	CHITCHAT

Barnum back everything is running, I think.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what happened to BS like this software that I use to stream.	CHITCHAT
Everything went red and then it just tanked.	CHITCHAT
So I apologize.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know why I crashed.	CHITCHAT
That was weird.	CHITCHAT
Usually have an answer, but it just happened.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, let's go back to the iPad.	CHITCHAT
So this is Part 2 of later fresh cake if you want to get the whole spiel as to what I'm doing, going the replace check out part one.	CHITCHAT
It will all be there, likely wouldn't get too far into the stream.	CHITCHAT
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
All right, rock 'n'.	CHITCHAT
Roll it with.	CHITCHAT
What I was doing, where I think everyone is pretty much back in here already.	CHITCHAT
Where did I lose everybody that was watching?	CHITCHAT
I was talking about drawing the leg and what it was going to look like and how this person had a stroke as their pinkies out and.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Flexible.	CHITCHAT
So OK, we're just going to start drawing.	O
I'm sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Everyone.	CHITCHAT
I feel really bad that keeps happening.	CHITCHAT
I gotta look into it.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's My Internet.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what's going on.	CHITCHAT
I remember like what am I doing?	CHITCHAT
I remember way back early on I was having some some crashing issues and it came out that my or the reason why my streams were getting closed out and hidden and everything was.	CHITCHAT
I was like a like a like a sensory censorship kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
'cause I don't know.	CHITCHAT
The forces that be at the hands thought that I was drawn something suggestive.	CHITCHAT
That's what I was told.	CHITCHAT
So I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that's what did it, but I was told that was fixed, so I think this time it was me.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to say.	CHITCHAT
It's a little too intense.	O
There.	O
See, This is why I like that.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
No, This is why I always do it this way.	O
'cause this light comes in front and then this leg goes behind and it looks way more cool so.	O
My plan is not going to work like I wanted it to.	O
All good.	O
We're just going to make cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
You missed the whole leg thing.	O
Well, I apologize, but here it is and see.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you know, I also like part of this too.	CHITCHAT
Everyone's home sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking.	CHITCHAT
I'm reading Chris Chris.	CHITCHAT
Your comment.	CHITCHAT
I feel like everyone's home right now and streaming stuff and like.	CHITCHAT
Internet providers or just getting their teeth kicked in so.	CHITCHAT
You know, I chalk up a lot of failures right now to the current state that we're in.	CHITCHAT
You know, as like a society with the virus and everything.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's extend this leg now, 'cause this anatomy makes no sense right now.	O
And we're going to will figure that foot out when we get there.	O
It's just a.	CHITCHAT
It's just so I know where things need to go.	O
Your body part placement maybe will actually hold on.	O
It will do like a arched leg that can be kind of God.	O
I've never thought to do that with a walking character really.	O
I'm sorry you guys missed the whole like thing.	CHITCHAT
I tried to reenact it, but you know I pulled something and I don't want to.	O
I gotta draw and I you know, I need this leg to make the art like so it's just that you know I can't recreate it.	O
I apologized.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, what's up man how you doing?	CHITCHAT
I was wondering where you were earlier.	CHITCHAT
I was going to ask about your new guitar.	CHITCHAT
How you doing the Strat?	CHITCHAT
And I believe you said it was like fire engine red or something Cherry Red.	CHITCHAT
I don't remember.	CHITCHAT
It's not awesome.	CHITCHAT
Hi.	CHITCHAT
Make a new layer.	O
Let's lower the opacity of this, 'cause my linework always kind of is a little distracting when I'm all done and let's grab the color black for right now will change that later.	O

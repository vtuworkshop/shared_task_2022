Let's see, I'm working by the way in a canvas 2100 by 2100.	O
I'm gonna be using a vector brush.	O
And yeah, that's pretty much got to know.	CHITCHAT
You know, I just notice to my discord and all my fun links aren't in the description, and we're going to need those, aren't we?	CHITCHAT
So let's put those in there for everybody.	CHITCHAT
Give me 1 second.	CHITCHAT
If anyone got any questions, that would be a good time to ask why I copy and paste stuff.	CHITCHAT
And let's make sure we solve properly.	CHITCHAT
Put the capital be cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so if anyone wants to join a discord chat or anything else, it's in the link below.	CHITCHAT
Please happen there, click it, join.	CHITCHAT
We have fun conversations.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's go back to drawing.	CHITCHAT
I should mention with everybody literally spent 4 five hours in XD for one project.	CHITCHAT
It's funny how to go Sir.	CHITCHAT
How do you like XP it?	CHITCHAT
So that's one of the software that I really want to learn.	CHITCHAT
It's on my bucket list for sure.	CHITCHAT
For my smoothing up to 85.	O
Fiesta Red Fiesta runs out like is it like a dark red or is it like a like I said I think I said a fire engine red earlier like what is Fiesta Red?	CHITCHAT
'cause I have a pickup truck that is.	CHITCHAT
Madrid, red or something is what they called it, and it's like a very bright red.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so that's our ear.	O
Let's make our mouth.	O
Oops, my hand slipped.	O
Steady hands are important.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it takes a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I've played around in XDA bit I used it for a project where we're doing some like web design and I want to mock up kind of what some some UI elements like what the skin of 'em would look like.	CHITCHAT
Used it for that and it was pretty successful, but definitely a little bit of learning curve.	CHITCHAT
Jack to the rescue.	CHITCHAT
What don't you know?	CHITCHAT
I'll be honest anytime I have a question I'm asking you, that's that's where that's where we're going with us.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so for anyone that's new to watch in an might be curious as to what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
I work with layers quite a bit because I find it non destructive.	O
I like being able to go back and change things later on in one of the nice things it allows me to create really clean lines so I'm kind of just drawing through all my line work right now and with this tongue and I'm sure you're like looking at it like wow, that's weird.	O
Maybe we're going for a crazy design or you just jacked up your whole illustration.	O
All good.	O
That's why I do it so I can create that really clean kind of connection between the two lines.	O
Something else I want to know I'm using this is version 1.6 Now Pre-release Alfresco.	O
So a couple features you might not have in your version, but will be available with his little toggle now and you drag down.	O
Oh wait, hold on, hit the toggle you erase just like you could before, but if you hit it and then you drag down, you can then draw this little blue line and it delete that whole area so you have to go back and hit like the paint bucket and do a bunch of stuff.	O
Oh sorry, there is a pending.	O
Comet.	O
There we go.	O
I don't know why it's depending that was very appropriate for everybody.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't like the cursed or anything.	CHITCHAT
Weird.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm gonna have to do an after effects thing 'cause I feel like everyone's really grumpy with after effects and I love after effects.	O
It's like one of my favorite software.	CHITCHAT
I use it quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
Those animations I've been posted in the discord are from there.	O
Actually just bought the rubber hose plug in from battleaxe.co cool.	O
Pull the plug.	O
Alright, let's see.	O

Now I keep looking at the streams.	CHITCHAT
I'm worried that like that it's going to cut out and I'm going to miss something.	CHITCHAT
Also, when I went live the second time, did anyone get notified or you just notified by my?	CHITCHAT
My my.	CHITCHAT
Discord of everything.	CHITCHAT
That sentence didn't make any sense.	CHITCHAT
Just now I said, did you get notified by me sending everything when I sent out the new link to the going live?	CHITCHAT
That's why I wanted to ask.	CHITCHAT
What brush are using right now?	CHITCHAT
I am currently using the vector basic round brush with pressure dynamics velocity dynamics turned on.	O
Anna smoothing of 84.	O
It's vector brush, so for anyone new to fresco there are several new brushes.	O
Are there several brush that's there's pixel brush which they just recently added a bunch of new stuff too.	O
I don't know where they are exactly thing under like painting that in a ton of new paint brushes, but these act like your basic Photoshop brushes, so if you select one you start painting and drawing.	O
You get cool textures and stuff like that pretty smooth.	O
There's some really cool things in here.	CHITCHAT
You can import Kyle brushes.	O
You can import brushes just like you do in photo shop, no problem.	O
And yeah, they're really nice.	O
There's a lot.	O
There's a ton of options than the other one that everyone really likes is the live brushes, which are basically watercolors and oil paints, and you can do really cool things with this, such as make a new layer, like if you grab this watercolor here and click and then you can kind of paint it on and it will bleed just like a normal watercolor, and I think if you hit.	O
The three dots you can then hit dry layer.	O
It will freeze wherever that bleed out was occuring.	O
So that's what those brushes are.	O
And then I use oops.	CHITCHAT
I like to use the vector brush.	O
Interesting only the first dream.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if and only if it only posts the replays.	CHITCHAT
Don't ask about that anyway, going back here.	CHITCHAT
Now you gave us the Pantone number.	O
That's hardcore.	CHITCHAT
Did you like look that up, or did they tell you 'cause like not really curious is that because like most places don't, you never know what the Pantone color is.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, the blending is awesome, so like check this out here.	O
So for those of you that don't know what there is referencing is that you can take a color like let's say this and will do a cool pixel brush really quick.	O
Let's let's use the rake that I had right then.	O
You can take the watercolor and let's take a color and then you can go here and you can draw over and it will bleed out whatever that pixel is underneath.	O
But then you can also grab like another color with your watercolor and kind of go there and it starts to bleed it just like a normal watercolor does.	O
It's pretty incredible.	CHITCHAT
You could dry layer and so you can make some really cool gradients.	O
You can do some awesome stuff with it like it really is spectacular if I do say so myself.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Bob Ross, just remember there are no, we don't make mistakes, we just make happy accidents.	CHITCHAT
Chris, I've had that happen to these things come loose like mines.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like I can unscrew it right now.	CHITCHAT
I usually screw mine in super extremely tight, like in hopes that like you know, it doesn't come loose, but it does happen.	CHITCHAT
And you know what else is funny?	CHITCHAT
When I bought this I got like spare nibs.	CHITCHAT
I've never had to swap the nib on it, so I'm curious as to when that has to happen.	CHITCHAT
Like I wonder if I come over do like is it like guitar strings and you should swap than it out like you know every so many weeks or whatever?	CHITCHAT
Or is it like?	CHITCHAT
Does it get chewed up?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I haven't had it happen.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're drawn in a hand.	O
We're going to do a couple layers here.	O
We're just going to go start.	O
Going to town.	O
Big chunky sausage fingers.	CHITCHAT
I think that's 'cause I feel like my fingers are kind of soda Winky.	CHITCHAT
We got like little like I like graceful piano ain't playing hands.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Little color do.	O
Oh oh that's awesome is used on 50s cadillacs OK so for anyone who's curious as to what we're talking about right now in the chat now has let us know in the discord group that.	CHITCHAT
He bought a brand new Strat that is Fiesta Red.	CHITCHAT
That's really cool that they took the color.	CHITCHAT
From 1950s Cadillac.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I love that kind of stuff, man, that's like that's just like good design when people in like companies do that kind of stuff and they like reference old like you know.	CHITCHAT
When it's all cars are old.	CHITCHAT

How do you approach local business businesses for that stuff and see half the time they think they can spend the money or they don't need it.	CHITCHAT
Well, there's a couple ways you can approach that.	CHITCHAT
One, I know exactly what you're talking about.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to convince people if they think they don't need it.	CHITCHAT
One of the best ways that I have often found to convince somebody whether or not they need the help and you don't have to be as crash or forward about this.	CHITCHAT
But like prime example, my buddy of mine was starting up something on his own and we were talking about you know what kind of what he needed for logo design.	CHITCHAT
He was talking about using just some kind of cheap quick generating service and he's like it works against the job done.	CHITCHAT
I don't need anything fancy for what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
People in my business or my field, don't?	CHITCHAT
You know they don't care about that kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
My kind of clients and I made the point of telling that listen if you were to interview somebody, are you going to hire the guy that comes in a nice suit or you going to hire the guy that came in in jeans and a dirty T shirt?	CHITCHAT

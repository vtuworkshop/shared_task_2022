He's like, well, I would hire the guy in the my suit.	CHITCHAT
I was like exactly the same thing with your brand.	CHITCHAT
People aren't going to want to come to you if your brand looks like you know.	CHITCHAT
Booty cakes like you gotta you gotta, you know you want your brand to be the guy in the suit.	CHITCHAT
In the interview you don't want your brand to be the.	CHITCHAT
Giant Indiana dirty T shirt.	CHITCHAT
So sometimes that's a good way to approach it.	CHITCHAT
If you approach someone that we don't need a willing to spend the money like, we're fine the way we are.	CHITCHAT
Another good way also is just to point out and kindly do this.	CHITCHAT
Don't be a jerk about it, but the kindly point out some of the areas as a professional designer that you're seeing flaws and how it could improve their business and a lot of times when people think they don't need help.	CHITCHAT
They just don't understand or they don't see the vision.	CHITCHAT
And that's kind of your place as the artist.	CHITCHAT
Well, that was really helpful advice is now.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're adding in some eyebrows went ahead and some tired lines as per huge.	O
Little distant from everything, let's actually go back with a new layer.	O
This way we kind of have the flexibility to share some things up when we're done, not something good.	CHITCHAT
We're doing a class stream going to hit you up on the side.	CHITCHAT
We're going to make it happen.	CHITCHAT
Would be really fun.	CHITCHAT
Your game, I'm game.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully the Internet holds out in the stream, doesn't like kick the bucket.	CHITCHAT
Classic streaming issues.	CHITCHAT
We can talk about creative shop, actually where we're sitting here like subject, what's the?	CHITCHAT
What's the plan with?	CHITCHAT
It was like your vision for this big mouth.	CHITCHAT
Like what do you do you live in or do you have any thoughts yet?	CHITCHAT
I don't want to put you on the spot if you're still figuring it out.	CHITCHAT
And just so everybody knows where to draw the body real quick so the body is just going to be trying to find the right thickness as I kind of want to match everything else I I lines are a little heavy, but I kind of like that.	O
There are like super heavy characters, got some thick lines.	O
Little thicker than what I normally draw, but it's all good.	O
Is all good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it is kind of sales.	CHITCHAT
Let's see where do you get your music for streaming?	CHITCHAT
So I get my music from.	CHITCHAT
Artlist dot IO.	CHITCHAT
Website you can get music for client work to.	CHITCHAT
From there it's a base fee of $200 for the year, and then you can use the music for whatever you want.	CHITCHAT
Client work you can you know it's for profit stuff.	CHITCHAT
All that kind of stuff which is nice.	CHITCHAT
Adobe.	CHITCHAT
When you asked is Adobe have copyrights, what do you mean on it depends on what.	CHITCHAT
All the music I use it it's mine.	CHITCHAT
You know, like if they do like a promotional thing using sorry, had to blow my nose really quick.	CHITCHAT
Right now.	CHITCHAT
Go away.	CHITCHAT
No, I don't have anything with my hands on, but whenever I watch him before I like.	CHITCHAT
Handle food now I'm touching the iPad screen, so that defeats the purpose so well.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going outside anytime soon anyway.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, back to what I was saying.	CHITCHAT
Does Adobe have copyrights?	CHITCHAT
I mean they do like if they do a promotional thing that they did something for me on Behance.	CHITCHAT
They just took the footage and they didn't use any of my music or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
They put their own stuff in so I'm sure they have, you know a source where they get their own stuff from but they don't use.	CHITCHAT
They don't have like don't you like my stuff?	CHITCHAT
But I do own the rights to the music that you're that you're listening to.	CHITCHAT
Or have you know as royalty free or whatever the word is for rights usage?	CHITCHAT
I licensed it, that's why I'm trying to say.	CHITCHAT
You were talking about this actually in one of the streams that everything is kind of on hold because of the 'cause everything that's going on.	CHITCHAT
If I play in the background, I don't own it.	CHITCHAT

'cause I definitely would.	CHITCHAT
I'll do extreme about that for sure.	CHITCHAT
I'm still learning the program.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to do a stream about something that I don't know a whole lot about.	CHITCHAT
I want to have at least a working knowledge before I go live with it.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise it's just going to be fumbling through words, clicking on stuff, which I guess would be entertaining, but.	CHITCHAT
Now, whether snows awesome.	CHITCHAT
I was watching another streamer earlier today and we were talking about.	CHITCHAT
We were talking about things we don't like and things that stink and the beach came up and that's the one thing for me that I can't get behind.	CHITCHAT
Is in the beach.	CHITCHAT
Lot of people are going to disagree with me right now.	CHITCHAT
I can feel it feel it coming.	CHITCHAT
Oh what's up Cody?	CHITCHAT
How you doing everybody coding is another streamer.	CHITCHAT
You should check out the streams super awesome.	CHITCHAT
Like cool like I don't know like just awesome like illustration stuff to do your work reminds me of like children's books like I just want to like share your work with my daughter.	CHITCHAT
But you know, I feel like that's kind of stuff that like it, works awesome.	CHITCHAT

You can plug yourself if you like.	CHITCHAT
Tell me a little bit about yourself, you know.	CHITCHAT
Unwelcome Cody and check out.	CHITCHAT

Really, I've been trying to get a children's book agent, OK.	CHITCHAT
Are there any children's books agents in here?	CHITCHAT
Because you know, actually.	CHITCHAT
Cody, I should hit you up on the DM in discord because I have a cousin that that.	CHITCHAT
She wrote a children's book.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's still what's going on with it now, but I know she had written a children's book and.	CHITCHAT
And she was looking for an artist for it, and she had asked me to do it.	CHITCHAT
She knew I drew, but my style does not bode well for children's books so.	CHITCHAT
I'll hit you up and maybe maybe we can make a connection there.	CHITCHAT
This was a little while ago and she had asked, but maybe it's still in the works.	CHITCHAT
I should mention like this isn't just like I got a friend that wrote a book and wants an artist like she's a working professional and she is at least he's a psychologist and she wrote a children's book trying to help children understand like depression and things of that nature.	CHITCHAT
And obviously, you know it's tackling a very adult issue, but at a child's level.	CHITCHAT
So it's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, she is not just like some person.	CHITCHAT
This is like what she does professionally.	CHITCHAT
So and we're just drawn in some hair here.	CHITCHAT
So I just I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I just made a big blob.	CHITCHAT
Will clean that up in that up in post as they say.	CHITCHAT
In the film industry, we got like a bald dude.	CHITCHAT
I said earlier I'm going to draw girl.	CHITCHAT
I started making like a guy hold on.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back here.	CHITCHAT
This is like the go to see.	CHITCHAT
Always make balding middle aged men because I'm going to be approaching middle age in the near Future.	CHITCHAT
An I'm balding or I am bald like there's nothing up here you know so so it's just relatable for me.	CHITCHAT
But let's see here let's let's let's go way back.	CHITCHAT

Of a character like an animated character in their hands are out like this, and it's become like a really favored.	CHITCHAT

You know what?	CHITCHAT
I'm actually not in the illustrator discord, which I really should be so.	CHITCHAT

'cause I feel like a couple people now that like I've been, you know.	CHITCHAT
Talking to the streams and stuff are all in it.	CHITCHAT
I'm like not in there for some.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why I'm not in there.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why I never did it so I can get an invite that be great.	CHITCHAT
Oh, the pinky out for sipping tea.	CHITCHAT
OK, will do pinky out.	CHITCHAT
On the other hand, like you know, like maybe this one she's like doing, uh, I don't know some kind of weird gang side.	CHITCHAT

Oh, who is The Who is the artist from Nick?	CHITCHAT
I'd be curious to know actually.	CHITCHAT
It's funny I grew up.	CHITCHAT
I grew up watching Nickelodeon quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
We didn't have cable in my household, but I spend a lot of time at my uncles and they had cable so I would watch Nickelodeon there everyday after school.	CHITCHAT
Until my folks pick me up and then we got cable and it just was nonstop Nickelodeon.	CHITCHAT
And then in my adult career life now I actually get to work with Nickelodeon on some projects for their YouTube channel, which is really fun.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to work on things like loud house in Sponge Bob.	CHITCHAT
So true.	CHITCHAT

I mean most people know the drill.	CHITCHAT
At this point I think that are watching this is a stream that has drinking involved, so most people have ears.	CHITCHAT
I don't now.	CHITCHAT
Usually you're pretty good for one so, so maybe you got something over there.	CHITCHAT
I'm drinking Narragansett as usual.	CHITCHAT
I haven't changed my beer selection recently because we're on lock down.	CHITCHAT
An liquor stores aren't really delivering to my area as I live in the Woods.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's get right into it.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to waste a lot of time 'cause I got some cool things.	CHITCHAT
I want to show everybody.	CHITCHAT
Word illustrator this has been a question that's been asked quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
How do I apply gradients and what do I do with my work after fresco?	O
So to give everyone an idea if you're new to the stream, go back.	CHITCHAT
Watch the replay from Mondays stream happy hour where I drew this guy in Adobe fresco.	CHITCHAT
Now you can do a couple of things to bring a file from fresco into whatever software you want to use next.	O
You can utilize the creative cloud and transferred over into photo shop.	O
It will sync up.	O
Basically you make your drawing.	O
You wait a little bit.	O
I've already proven that it doesn't fully work as well.	O
This past Saturday had a little hang up, but.	CHITCHAT
Basically, wait a little bit.	O
Once everything is synced, you can open up Photoshop on your iPad or open up Photoshop on your desktop, which is probably more desirable.	O
Open up on your desktop and you'll have that file right there.	O
Now this file because the reason is a photo shop file.	O
Now this file is all vector art was made with vector brushes, so I was able to export it as a PDF and then import the PDF into illustrator and one of the really cool things about it is that it maintains bilayer structure.	O
So I got my little guy right here and if I drop down into the groups.	O
That I had from fresco you can see like I've got my shade layer or that God will like extra goop there.	O
I forgot I had it that I've got machining somewhere in here detail like all that stuff so really super nice.	O
Let's see who else is here.	CHITCHAT
Who BrewDog yeah.	CHITCHAT
Oh sometimes you doing.	CHITCHAT
Is anyone in here actually watching?	CHITCHAT
I should always ask this question.	CHITCHAT
The beginning.	CHITCHAT
Anyone watching new to these streams right now?	CHITCHAT
Have you just discovered a fresh take stream?	CHITCHAT
If you have, I apologize if I was yelling.	CHITCHAT
'cause apparently my microphone was kind of loud or people had their computers turned up too loud.	CHITCHAT
Not sure yet.	CHITCHAT
We're figuring that out.	CHITCHAT
I'm just very loud.	CHITCHAT
Fun individual, an exciting kisses again.	CHITCHAT
Like I said earlier, we're making drawings.	CHITCHAT
If you are new though, drop into the chat.	CHITCHAT
Say hello hey, what's up, Jack?	CHITCHAT
We got a pretty cool community and you know everyone is super friendly.	CHITCHAT
So if anyone's new all the you know.	CHITCHAT
Returnees, you know to do.	CHITCHAT
Give him a warm, fresh cake welcome.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Jack, I am excited for your stream on Saturday.	CHITCHAT
I believe you said it was in the afternoon.	CHITCHAT
Plug yourself.	CHITCHAT
Jack is another streamer coming here to ban.	CHITCHAT
So be sure to check out his work.	CHITCHAT
He does really cool stuff right now.	CHITCHAT
Nothing the chat.	CHITCHAT
So for everyone that watched this drawing get made last you'll notice I added to my bubble gum kind of pink stuff behind.	O
I just felt like I needed something so this was the original doodle.	O
That's what he looks like.	O
It's kind of boring as little plane.	CHITCHAT
You know I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm looking at it.	CHITCHAT
I kinda dig it so.	CHITCHAT
We've got this like bubble gum junk over top.	O
I don't know if we're going to keep it just yet.	O
Maybe we will, maybe we won't.	O
Let's do this.	O
Let's start out.	CHITCHAT
Let me go off screen here and get my artboards.	O
There we go.	O
We're going to pull this down.	O
I'm going to drop it into here and we get rid of this.	O
So let's let's make sure nothing is locked, which nothing is.	O
Let's just make another artboard really quick just so we have two versions of this guy 'cause I don't know if I want to keep that thing stuff or not.	O
I think we need this guy Fred last time so actually this we got Fred One and we've got Fred two, so let's see.	CHITCHAT
And I hate I.	CHITCHAT
PS Oh Sam, not the trick is Sam.	CHITCHAT
If you hate Ipas, you gotta think about grapefruit while you drink it.	CHITCHAT
That's every once told me and I agree it worked, you know?	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's shut off the bubble gum on this one layer.	O
Let's just blow it away 'cause we got, we got duplicates.	O
That's why we work in Digital.	O
And we're going to lock our background, so we're going to select him and quick note in illustrator if you want to lock something fast without going and hitting a little lock, just hit command to.	O
That's all it is.	O
Command two will lock it and then you gotta go and click it, unlock it.	O
But now that we have a lot of stuff without worrying about grabbing that background and move it around, so let's get this guy right here.	O
Let's make let's center here.	O
So to center things.	O
Always take a rectangle grid tool.	O
Double click.	O
Let's bring this over so you can see it.	O
Make it a one by one, so one by one we should have like a one or you have like 4 squares in a box.	O

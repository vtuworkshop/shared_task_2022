And then I always just kind of get in my corner there, come down their bottom, let it go and hit command five.	O
I'm just said command for hit command five.	O
It's not fully centered.	O
Let's make sure that this is as close as we can get it comfortable.	O
Alright, cool, so you hit command five it's going to take those lines you created and it's going to turn him into a guide and you can do this by the way, with anything like any shapes like you know you can make some like weird things you can take like a star, an hit command five and boom you gotta start guide which is super cool.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So let's get rid of that.	O
Let's see got some chats coming in.	CHITCHAT
In there in the chat now you just mentioned this kind of power.	CHITCHAT
Does anyone likes hours?	CHITCHAT
I love sour beers.	CHITCHAT
Think that's like a mograph thing.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why it's like a lot of like motion graphics, artist drink sour beers.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we got a guy.	CHITCHAT
We got our guide.	CHITCHAT
We can turn it off so the hockey to turn guides office just command and then the little.	CHITCHAT
OK Music.	CHITCHAT
Turn that down.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much either.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, audio, check me, I'm going to be totally honest with everybody.	CHITCHAT
I do not get a chance to do an audio check before this stream.	CHITCHAT
I just plug my music in.	CHITCHAT
It went live.	CHITCHAT
Who is running a little late?	CHITCHAT
I forgot to get verified run upstairs to grab it and drinking is part of the stream.	CHITCHAT
Alright so we got our two characters.	O
Let's let's remove a few things, so there's a few things fresco does that I hate it adds this clipping mask, which makes it really frustrating 'cause you can't drag things out of your art board, so I just I delete them like every time.	O
It's just I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's my.	CHITCHAT
It's like the first thing I do is always the number one thing in your dropdown.	O
So he's going to get the first layer so you just drop it down, get rid of it.	O
This way we have some room to kind of.	O
Move stuff around if we want you know.	O
So I just get rid of that feeling creates more problems and solves.	O
And again, this is a PDF that came out of Adobe fresco drawing that I did on Monday, and now we're bringing it into illustrator.	O
Then do some cool stuff.	O
It's funny 'cause like illustrator is not my most proficient app, but I do enjoy it quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
Ooh, I like the Goose IPA.	CHITCHAT
That's a good one.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's.	CHITCHAT
Let's, uh, let's see some gradient, so let's start with our will.	O
Start with our first guy over here, the one without.	O
The what's it called?	CHITCHAT
The little pink like blob.	O
So whenever I do my gradients I always grab this he ran, I move it out of the way now I've got an art board setup so I probably don't need to do this trick because I could just grab the color from over here if I wanted too from that guy.	O
But usually when I'm working I don't have that second artboard, it just looks something like this.	O
So I keep a color reference like off to the side.	O
I don't need to do that today, 'cause I got one right here so.	O
What we're going to do is we're gonna grab our our selection like arrow.	O
What is it called?	CHITCHAT
It's got a specific name direct select tool.	O
There we go, we grab our direct select tool where to tap?	O
We're just going to grab this pink.	O
You know, kind of wherever it is, so I'm just clicking right inside the fill color and we're going to apply gradient gradient tool, right?	O
We're going to tap, there were gonna get a little fly out.	O
We can leave and move this out here so we could see it the whole time.	O
Open it up a little bit and we're going to fly gradient.	O
Done and there you go.	O
That's how you do it.	CHITCHAT
Oh I missed a spot on a bummer.	O
I missed a couple spots all boy getting rusty.	CHITCHAT
New software, but different stream.	CHITCHAT
Nervous, you know all the things that you get.	CHITCHAT
Let's just make this gradient all one.	O
So basically when I selected all those things and click, the gradient is selecting all the individual shapes I'm going to grab off to the side I'm just going to pull it out to over here and boom, there we go.	O
It's created all the gradients and it's got a nice blend.	O
We're actually going to convert this to do a radial and we're going to redo what I just did.	O
So my light source is kind of coming from like this way, and.	O
Here we want to make sure we get all of these parts.	O
There we go.	O
So when I put the shade on the back part here.	O
So let's see, let's compare.	O
So where's my boots?	O
Alright, let's grab some color first before I do the radio part.	O
Really rubber eyedropper and we're just going to be here and they wanna grab this one when I click it, grab the eyedropper and grab that color so they look exactly the same.	O
And basically what we're going to do is we're going to select the far side color, which is this one over here where to double to double tap on it.	O

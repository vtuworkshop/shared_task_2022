And we're going to just start playing around and I found something that works really well.	O
Something kinda cool, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Some kind of dark.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
No, it did not want to adjust, so how's already doing out there?	O
I feel like you know.	CHITCHAT
Like how we are holding up.	CHITCHAT
We hang in there.	CHITCHAT
We bored at home yet.	CHITCHAT
What are we doing with the outside world like?	CHITCHAT
I feel like I don't even know.	CHITCHAT
I want this let me change the color.	O
Weird.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool.	O
Again, like I said, I feel like I haven't been outside in awhile.	CHITCHAT
So why are all mulling over what you're doing?	CHITCHAT

It's better on.	CHITCHAT
Is it cold up where you are?	CHITCHAT
I know you're in New Hampshire, correct?	CHITCHAT
Like I heard it's really hot in Florida.	CHITCHAT
Somebody I worked with on another project was saying that it's been super warm lately.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're just making some adjustments here on the radio gradient.	O
I always try to grab and kind of get everything into a place where.	O
Where you got this really nice shade kind of happening on the backside, but also a little bit on like the side of his head over here.	O
The reason for that is because ideally there would be a little bit of shading on that part.	O
Who French baking do?	CHITCHAT
That sounds awesome.	CHITCHAT
You know the hobbies that you pick up right now.	CHITCHAT
We're all like stuck at home is amazing.	CHITCHAT
So like, I recently decided that like I've decided to live out my life long dream of becoming a bartender, but I didn't know it was a dream of mine until very recently.	CHITCHAT
So now like making all these like wacky drinks at home.	CHITCHAT
I tried to create.	CHITCHAT
It's called an old pal the other day, horrible.	CHITCHAT
Right, so this is looking pretty cool.	O
I'm actually really driving this.	O
You know what I forgot to grab the top part of this?	O
No, not a problem.	O
Here's what we do to grab grab a direct select tool first, grab the right tool grabber gradients so when you do something like this like I realize I am effed on that one part.	O
I'm going to get this little?	O
Right here.	O
'cause illustrators like yo you got two different colors and they're not doing what they're supposed to.	O
All good.	O
Where to tap?	O
Going to drag.	O
We're going to make it 1 solid deal again and now we can just kind of go through and start adjusting and correcting stuff.	O
Wow, I like made a bunch of these.	O
OK anyway.	O
For the individual shapes, OK, that makes sense.	O
So where's the head?	O
That's why I want which is low appears to be this one.	O
So I'm just adjusting everything, basically trying to make it look you know where where I wanted to go.	O
Your new hobbies.	CHITCHAT
Watching streams, live streams on their hands together, one which rooms are you watching?	CHITCHAT
I know you said you're watching Elicia's.	CHITCHAT
She's got some really awesome ones man her streams are cool I know she does the paper illustrations and she's a member of the disk or as well which is nice.	CHITCHAT
But what other streams everybody watching here?	CHITCHAT
All bands I feel like a lot of people have taken to that as a hobby recently, so I would like to hear what everyone's kind of tuning into.	CHITCHAT
So I'm kind of happy with that gradient.	O
What do we think we all good with us?	CHITCHAT
We like it.	CHITCHAT

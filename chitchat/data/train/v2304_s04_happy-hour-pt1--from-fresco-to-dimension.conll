OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm not.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Cool.	O
Yeah, could be anything a spoon.	O
Have we also decided I know we name this character, but do we decide why?	CHITCHAT
Why he's pointing?	CHITCHAT
And got his tongue sticking out like a crazy person.	O
We figured that out.	O
Yet the characters name is Fred that was determined by Daphne in the last year.	O
I don't know if they're watching right now.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we're not a gradient to the tongue whenever I do my gradient set on things that are coming out of like so.	O
You see how the inside of the mouth has like this.	O
Very like solid color and it's just like a dark area.	O
Obviously I want to say, you know it's matched the line work.	O
I always try to add a gradient that has the same color and then kind of.	O
Less than it up a bit so that it looks like it's an actual shadow that's being casted on the object so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Oh, he did.	CHITCHAT
What were they pointing at?	CHITCHAT
I don't remember.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I didn't see it.	CHITCHAT
That's possible.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes the chat gets a little crazy and I'm on a delay from everybody.	CHITCHAT
So like all of a sudden a bunch of comments, Gohan, I miss him, so I apologize.	CHITCHAT
I try really hard to not miss the comments and it's funny because somebody in one of my streams made that they made the comment there like.	CHITCHAT
Best thing about fresh cakes that he pays attention to the chat.	CHITCHAT
So now I feel extremely obligated to see everything you alltel say.	CHITCHAT
I never want to miss anything.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see here.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to have this tongue gradient.	O
We gotta get the blue we get the right color blue.	O
Let's grab that.	O
Then on the back end here, whoops.	O
On the backside here or grab bar color pic and we're just going to grab the line color and we gotta rotate 'cause we're backwards.	O
Drag it alright, let's.	O
In let's stretch this all out.	O
So we're just anyone got any questions so far as to what I'm doing or tools I'm using?	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty much just using the gradient tools.	O
Nothing fancy.	CHITCHAT
Pointing out a clown there.	O
We go quite a clown after eating blue Raspberry stuff is cool.	CHITCHAT
I like it.	CHITCHAT
Right, so I want to see what this looks like an.	CHITCHAT
I want to see what this looks like right now and it's a little distracting because there's the gradient tool on top.	O
We got.	O
Our lines are outlined or uh, or fill color is outlined with all the little little points that you can drag.	O
How do we see this thing?	CHITCHAT
'cause like right now is a lot of junk on the screen.	O
I just want to, but I don't want to lose my controls.	O
So all you gotta do is if you do the old command hide option in illustrator it doesn't work.	O
It hides what you got selected so you can actually see stuff FY I so you hit Command H.	O
And then you can see also if you ever working in illustration in illustrator on a Mac and you're wondering why you can't see any of your selections like it's not highlighting it.	O
Try hitting command H, it'll pop right back on, but that's the hockey I'm using and now I can actually take this.	O
I'm going to move this out-of-the-way little bit White 'cause it's a gradient tool and no matter where I move, it's going to kind of maintain that gradient across something put down.	O
I'm going to move it out of the way so I could see put it down here.	O
Maybe kind of moving in a little bit like that.	O
Let's share this up a bit.	O
There we go.	O
I'd say it's pretty good.	O
I like that.	O
That's maybe maybe a little less.	O
Let's let's click back on the time let's click our tool and let's just back it up her.	O
Oh, not what I want to do.	O
So B is your selection tool as your direct selection tool.	O
By the way, if you're ever curious and just click off and there you go.	O
Also, I think this works in here.	O
If you hit shift command D.	O
No that does not do it.	O
That just makes you see the transparent background for whatever that is should plan a hold on.	O
Yes, shift command a.	O
Also unselect whenever you have selected in illustrator.	O
Ever mess around with the freeform gradient tool?	O
Yes, so for anyone curious Jack is referencing, I think it's this one right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I have played around with the Jack.	CHITCHAT
I haven't gotten very good with it yet and it kind of Weirds me out a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know what to do with it.	CHITCHAT
Do you use it at odd?	CHITCHAT
Be really curious 'cause I'd love to learn and if you do use it, please show me in one of your streams.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, can you select your piece of Fred and group them so the gradient isn't?	CHITCHAT

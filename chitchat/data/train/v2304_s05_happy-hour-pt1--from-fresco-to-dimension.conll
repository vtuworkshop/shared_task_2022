100 isn't 100 PC.	CHITCHAT
Don't know what that means Heather.	CHITCHAT
I apologize, I want to answer your question.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, can you select all your pieces of Fred and group them?	CHITCHAT
Oh I see what you're saying.	CHITCHAT
So are gradient is 100 pieces.	O
Yes you can.	O
You could take them all and then what you could do and this is something that maybe I should have done the game.	O
We can play around this option sorry I mean at that what you could do is you could expand it and then you could grab.	O
You could merge it all together and you can grab that one shape and do it from there.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Let's just do it so I can show you 'cause that's what we're here for.	O
We're here to learn, you know what will do it on the other side when I go to do that.	O
Although this guys looking pretty good like honestly, the gradient work doesn't take much time.	O
Like usually it takes me about like 10 minutes, which is like makes me feel like I'm not a good artist.	CHITCHAT
Now that I say that out loud.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, I just do it really fast.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's a little buggy.	O
I've had the same problem like.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I was playing around with it and trying things and like they just weren't registering or working or doing anything that I needed them to do and it was really super irritating so I gave up.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some gradients in the eyes really quick.	O
And I guess we'll do that.	O
I'll do that next.	O
Alright, so for the eyes were going to poop Grabber gradient tool, click a gradient and that looks horrible.	O
So we want to do is again we want to grab grab the back color.	O
I called the backyard with the actual term is work and then let's grab.	O
Let's grab the line work and we're just going to pull this out.	O
Really, I mean like I said.	CHITCHAT
I feel kinda bad.	CHITCHAT
I feel like everyone expected me to do like a lot more stuff and I don't really do much when I do.	CHITCHAT
Gradient would be totally honest with everybody.	CHITCHAT
It's very much just like.	CHITCHAT
It's like the bare minimum.	CHITCHAT
Is how I achieved my gradient work?	CHITCHAT
It just adds a little something I don't know.	CHITCHAT
All right, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Cool cool.	CHITCHAT
And then for the teeth, you know we can do the same thing.	O
I usually grab whatever gradient colors in the eyes.	O
If they're white teeth are white, and then I just pull it down.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I should mention this, a hot key that everybody knows, but there's some people in here.	O
I'm sure that are a little bit new to illustrator or want to learn.	O
If you grab a point and you try to drag.	O
Whoops, let me just do this and grab this gradient gradient tool.	O
If I drag from here, right?	CHITCHAT
Like I can kind of put this anywhere I want, but if I wanted just to go straight up if I just hold shift it'll just snap and no matter where I move my icon it'll basically going like a 45 degree 3045 degree angle.	O
It will snap to that.	O
That direction, so if you like kind of over here, it's not like dragging awkwardly.	O
I always use that to figure out, like my main angle, and then from there I kind of refined going to go straight up.	O
We're going to come back little bit there, and we're going to pull this up just a bit.	O
Dragon down extended.	O
Let's I feel like I lost my gradient on those teeth.	O
Let's do that.	O
And let's just pull this down.	O
There we go.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Start up here.	O
Go that way.	O
Oops oh boy.	CHITCHAT
Time is relative, right?	CHITCHAT
And listen right now is just talking about this and other artists.	CHITCHAT
I have a friend that makes bantis pretty much and you find them in hot topic.	CHITCHAT
That's usually that's pretty much who is very talented illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Awesome guy.	CHITCHAT
If he's on the hands, if he is all linked to his work below, but his name is Brian and cool guy, but we were talking about that today.	CHITCHAT
With all this like time now being home and everything, how like the work days have just kind of blend together, you don't really know what day it is like Saturday doesn't exist anymore.	CHITCHAT
It's just the day you know and then you get to whatever point.	CHITCHAT
And if you want to stop working, you stop working.	CHITCHAT
If you want to keep going, keep going.	CHITCHAT
Right so we gotta.	CHITCHAT
Like with that gradients doing drag it up there we go alright cool so we gotta do.	CHITCHAT
I don't know gradient that worked no.	CHITCHAT
So usually this is the part where I stop and I go cool.	CHITCHAT
This is ready to be posted, but I did make this fun version and we got some questions about some stuff to do so.	CHITCHAT
Let's do we like better?	CHITCHAT
Actually, do we like the bubble gum clouds or do we like this gradient covered guy?	CHITCHAT
Do we like the flat version?	CHITCHAT
Let me know, let me know in the comments.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's talk a little bit about it.	CHITCHAT
Let's have a little art review for a few minutes here.	CHITCHAT
You know, no reason to jump through this too quick.	CHITCHAT

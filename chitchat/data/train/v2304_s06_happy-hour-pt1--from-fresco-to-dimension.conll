I don't have a sip of beer.	CHITCHAT
And again, the beer I'm drinking tonight for happy hour is Narragansett.	CHITCHAT
Made on are sold on Merritt.	CHITCHAT
Very good.	CHITCHAT
It's a basic lager.	CHITCHAT
It's like buying bingling or.	CHITCHAT
Budweiser Cool anyway, while we're waiting for people to comment on what they like better right now in this scene, I do want to point out I have a stream on Friday.	CHITCHAT
It is the time lapse.	CHITCHAT
It happens Friday at noon.	CHITCHAT
You can TuneIn check it out.	CHITCHAT
It should be pretty sweet.	CHITCHAT
Basically.	CHITCHAT
I take all the illustrations I've done from the week.	CHITCHAT
I'm probably going to take the ones from like Saturday from Saturday shown a nice trim out into a timeline.	CHITCHAT
There less than five minutes and.	CHITCHAT
You can tune in at noon.	CHITCHAT
You could check it out, watch a bunch of market made like speed art really fast.	CHITCHAT
I'm not on camera.	CHITCHAT
You don't hear my like obnoxious voice and my music bed and listen to me ramble.	CHITCHAT
You can just like watch the cool time lapse and spend a few minutes and then go back to your day.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, so it's a good time, so that's on Friday and Saturday.	CHITCHAT
I'll be streaming again lately with fresh cake that happens on Saturdays at 9:00 PM.	CHITCHAT
It is a longer stream where we kind of sit here.	CHITCHAT
We talk about all sorts of cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
Everyone voted number one nice.	CHITCHAT
Like both, but I think I prefer the blob addition in the first one.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool, so let's add a gradient.	O
Let's let's let's let's do a couple things.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's do this.	O
Let's first move this artboard right?	O
That's OK, so real quick when you're going to move in our board.	O
I feel like some of this is like illustrator 101, but it's good refresher when you go to move in our board.	CHITCHAT
Make sure you unlock layers otherwise they stay.	O
So we're going to drag this guy up here and I like duplicates alot.	O
The reason why I like duplicates last collection work nondestructively.	CHITCHAT
and I don't want to blow anything away that I may be made that I really enjoyed.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's move this guy down here so we have two blobs and they want to clean one up above.	O
So we got our original out.	O
Love.	CHITCHAT
We got our original out of Adobe Fresco an now we've got here.	O
Let's actually move this here and call this Fred 1K.	O
Fred one be cool.	CHITCHAT
So you want to point out if you just click on an artboard, it'll just take you right to it.	O
It's kind of cool to go a little double click on the number.	O
Fun fact.	CHITCHAT
We're trying to jump through a lot of Artboards.	O
Alright, let's let's grab our backgrounds groups.	O
Let's grab our backgrounds 3, lock them command to.	O
Alright, so Heather asked about if I merged all this stuff together and had one solid sheep.	CHITCHAT
If I could use it.	CHITCHAT
So the answer to that is yes.	CHITCHAT
So what we're going to do here is we're going to actually going to lock a lot of stuff.	O
Going to lock.	O
These guys were going to select everything command to lock it, an command two groups, not command.	O
Three that gets rid of it, man to lock it.	O
Alright so the only thing we can select right now is this stuff.	O
And we're actually going to take our shade, so I'm going to find it here, which is here.	O
No, not the one I want.	O
Or shading right all right.	O
So this layer?	O
Here's our shade.	O
Wanna lock that as well as their own effect that North like the shape.	O
Let's select everything.	O
Right, and you know what?	CHITCHAT
Let's not select this bubble gum up top.	O
Now you know what?	CHITCHAT
Let's just do it.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah alright.	CHITCHAT
Let's select everything.	O
And let's go to so you can see this park is off screen unfortunately, but I'm going to object expand.	O
And you're going to spend.	CHITCHAT
I only reason, why do that to make sure everything all my linework is expanded?	O
There's no like strokes or anything added.	O
It's just a precautionary measure.	O
I don't really need to do it, but I do it anyway just to be safe.	O
Much better.	O
Light dark light.	O
Add 1/3 Cup you know.	O
4th color I think I have three colors in here already, but we can add another color.	O
We want to add another color.	O
Let me know.	CHITCHAT
Thought about making the linework darker too.	O
Anyway, let's merge these sewing.	O
Click on merge tool up here.	O
Oh I.	CHITCHAT
Best out.	CHITCHAT
But I like that understand why.	CHITCHAT
My shaded what it did.	CHITCHAT
Interesting.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's do this.	O
Wanna grab we're going to tap Y so the magical onward to select all this stuff and then we're just going to merge together.	O
Oh not working.	O
God.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't want to behave right?	CHITCHAT
So we're going to do this.	CHITCHAT
We're going to make this really easy going to layer.	O
Going to grab my color and move it out.	O

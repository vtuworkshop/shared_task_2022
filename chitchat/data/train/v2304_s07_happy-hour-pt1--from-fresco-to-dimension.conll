The machine.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I see what you're saying.	CHITCHAT
Put a third.	O
OK, I gotcha.	O
We try that definitely.	O
Also got a shade.	O
So so layer.	O
I don't think I shaded over top of that goo.	O
I did not write.	O
This is cool.	CHITCHAT
Sweet, alright, let's lock that I don't need that get infected alright, let's grab everything on layer one here and let's work it.	O
Cool, so now everything is merged together, so this is all just like one big solid and we can grab.	O
All this stuff here I think Heather to achieve what you were trying to do.	CHITCHAT
You have to have like the line work on top of all of this.	O
But I mean it all kind of works the same.	O
I was gonna go up here.	O
We're gonna click this gradient.	O
There we go just with the eyedropper, and then I want to grab my gradient window 'cause it disappeared 'cause it closed it, 'cause it wasn't thinking.	O
And we're going to.	CHITCHAT
She still added all those, so I guess the answer your question is that it doesn't do what I thought was going to do.	CHITCHAT
It still kind of acting the same way as before, but everything is merged together now, which is nice, which actually helps us because I want to take this pink and I think about doing a gradient off the bottom.	O
You mentioned adding a third color.	O
Let's try it out.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what it does like, why not, right?	CHITCHAT
We're here, we're experimenting.	O
Sounds like moon.	CHITCHAT
So I just click down like between the dots and to add another gradient.	O
It'll kind of 3rd color.	O
We want to add.	O
You know what would be cool?	CHITCHAT
OK, hold on let's keep that like a pink tone.	O
And then let's make this like a purpley kind of color.	O
Oh yeah, we have something different going on now.	CHITCHAT
No, not what I want.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And let's go.	O
He forgot to grab that that little finger.	O
Alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
Why, why not?	CHITCHAT
Why you not changing little finger?	O
Yes.	O
There we go.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I'm really digging this.	O
I like that like addition to that purple color, it's kind of nice.	O
It's added like a dark spot, which is cool.	O
It's like a little bit.	O
Yeah, let's dragon how?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm actually.	CHITCHAT
Alright, cool.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I see what you're saying.	CHITCHAT
Oh, through like now you talking like let's go through all the pinks we could definitely try that would be kind of neat.	O
We could match them all up and then have a really cool 3 panel thing which I should probably talk a little bit about.	O
You know what we're going to do?	CHITCHAT
A couple of things actually.	CHITCHAT
I mean, we're not going to do couple things right now.	CHITCHAT
Let's say I want to get into dimensions and show a little bit of that off, something a little new, and something that like I know stuff about, but I don't know like everything about Alright, so we're going to grab this pink bubble gum blob behind our guy, right?	O
And let's just think about integrating into it like just adding linear gradient.	O
Super basic first we want a pinwheel that's always a good start.	O
I hope it in just freeze this thing.	O
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Zedd the pinwheel doom.	O
I bet you re froze.	O
That's going to suck.	O
Let's find out for squid.	O
Oh no, there it is for everyone to see.	CHITCHAT
Illustrator is not responding, done, done, done.	O
It's OK.	CHITCHAT
We're going to force quit anyway.	O
Maybe we'll recover it.	O
Let's see what happens.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what happens.	CHITCHAT
It sure does have a really good recovery.	O
I should point out there and if it doesn't recover right away, it's not a big deal.	O
You know we're not going to send the report right now.	O
Yeah, we got the recovered file nice.	O

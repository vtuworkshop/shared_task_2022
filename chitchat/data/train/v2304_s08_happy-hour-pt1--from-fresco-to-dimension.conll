Alright, see now we're rocking and rolling.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's save.	O
I have it saved as let's save it to my design folder illustrate.	O
Now you guys are seeing my my.	CHITCHAT
You've seen my secrets, you're seeing my like folder structure.	CHITCHAT
Let's not save it as an EPS will save it as an AI.	O
Alright cool, alright.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to do first we gotta fix this stupid finger.	O
Color.	O
There we go.	O
All right, uh, we wanted to affect the bubble gum color, so let's grab this.	O
Like Clear two was locked that off and let's lock up here just in case.	O
Alright cool, why grab the blob then?	CHITCHAT
Let's go to let's grab our gradient tool.	O
Hopefully doesn't like go all potato on us again.	CHITCHAT
'cause that would suck.	CHITCHAT
And let's just.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
No, OK, we're good.	CHITCHAT
We're rocking and rolling.	CHITCHAT
Why is this not ohmygosh?	CHITCHAT
Just doesn't want to go down.	CHITCHAT
Well, let me add a gradient to this, probably 'cause I'm selecting like everything.	O
Let's see, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Did it?	CHITCHAT
Did it?	CHITCHAT
Did it go belly up again?	CHITCHAT
Wow, no did OK force quit.	CHITCHAT
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Now I'm determined we're going to get this right.	CHITCHAT
I will not quit.	CHITCHAT
By the way, you should always send those reports.	CHITCHAT
I just quickly click that 'cause I didn't feel like it.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if you try something different here.	O
Let's just grab these things like this.	O
All I want to do is adding Adam gradient from like pink to.	O
Later.	CHITCHAT
All I want to do illustrator just let me have this I'm streaming right now.	CHITCHAT
The people want to know.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see gradient.	O
Yeah, OK.	CHITCHAT
Cool, so we're just going to draw million gradients.	O
And we're going to go and get her pink or eyedropper, grab the light pink for the top, and we're going to grab.	O
This might look kinda cool.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I won't.	CHITCHAT
I forgot forgot this guy.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
That's pretty sweet, we think.	O
I forgot that spot again.	O
Thoughts, feelings, emotions?	CHITCHAT
Which one do you like better?	CHITCHAT
I like the bubble gum, but I kind of wish this guy had like a I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I like the bubble gum.	CHITCHAT
Pink is just like the flat color.	O
I like the gradient on it.	O
So let's go back.	O
'cause I do want to hop into dimensions and show off a little bit of that.	O
Why are there so many points on your blob?	CHITCHAT
Maybe there are too many.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's probably something to do with that.	CHITCHAT
To answer question the reason why there's probably so many points, I'd written fresco and for some reason when you expand, it adds like every point ever.	O
I could clean that up if I really wanted to, but 60 minutes I don't feel like going through a million points and trying to clean it all up.	O
So there's no such thing as a stupid question that is very valid question, and the answer is yes.	CHITCHAT
That is probably what's happening.	CHITCHAT
Farmer in the comments are like like.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's Let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's get rid of some of the art that we've created, so I'm going to file.	O
I'm going to save as.	O
And we're going to save out another copy, and we're not going to recover.	O

Just call it Fred too.	O
What's the what's the thing for dimensions so they call it DN?	O
DN done OK.	O
So we're going to get rid of some stuff real quick just to make everything a little friendlier, so I want to stick with.	O
I think let's go, let's go with this one here.	O
The gradient character we have tongue gradient that we gotta put that in all right let's go the gradient tongue or the gradient character on the blank background.	O
So let's get rid of those artboards real quick.	O
Let's go to let's close it down.	O
Let's go here.	O
Let's unlock anything we had locked.	O
We nothing blocked alright, let's let's just get rid of this stuff.	O
Again, working with duplicates, we can blow whatever we want away.	O
It's not going to hurt anything.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Pull over that look like.	O
No big deal.	O
Radiance.	O
So again, I've been asked quite a bit to do other tutorials.	CHITCHAT
How do you like or other streams on other software?	CHITCHAT
Shouldn't even call it tutorial 'cause it's kind of meat is messing around.	CHITCHAT
How do you all like this?	CHITCHAT
How do you all like watching me work in illustrator usually I work in Adobe fresco just drawing today I'm showing a little bit more of workflow than what I normally do.	CHITCHAT
Is this something you all are into?	CHITCHAT
Should I do more of it?	CHITCHAT
Let me know in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to hear an I'd like to know, you know.	CHITCHAT
Are you finding this useful?	CHITCHAT
That's basically the question, because if you're not, I'll stick to fresco.	CHITCHAT
But if you are enjoying it then I'll do more of these.	CHITCHAT
It was little little hesitant to do other streams 'cause I feel like frescoes always really popular.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's save this out.	O
And let's just minimize illustrator.	O
Right now boom disappears.	CHITCHAT
OK, word a new piece of software and I feel like people would be looking at this.	CHITCHAT
Right now I'm thinking like wow, what the hell are we doing right here?	CHITCHAT
This is Adobe dimensions for those of you that don't know, Adobe dimensions is a piece of 3D software that Adobe created as a way to quickly mock up products.	O
Also, it works really well with Adobe Arrow, which is their VR app for the phone.	O
An iPad in mobile devices you basically can create something in here you can export it as you know BJ or model and you can bring it into whatever kind of other software you intend to use.	O
Or you can just export it right from.	O
Here is a photo shop file.	O
Touch it up a little bit and you can submit it to clients for things like product reviews.	O
Something could be really fun here.	CHITCHAT
On happy hour we can make a beer can.	CHITCHAT
Oh either please.	CHITCHAT
I mess up all the time like and guess what?	CHITCHAT
Who were in Adobe Dimensions now wanna mess up way more.	CHITCHAT
Messing up is a huge part of this, so let's grab a beer can.	CHITCHAT
Now you know that becomes boring delete.	CHITCHAT
Let's grab a beverage can.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what the difference is, well, they're both beverage cans.	CHITCHAT
This one has water on it.	CHITCHAT
Let's zoom in.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so to drag around in the scene really quick, if you just want to grab your canvas, it's just holding down the spacebar.	O
If you actually want to drag around in the scene, you just don't know how you do that.	O
Actually wait 012 and three on the number pad so one 'cause your rotation two is your like pan if you will and three is like your Dolly, your zoom in and out loud zoomed in way too far really fast.	O
Yeah I would put on a beer can.	CHITCHAT
That's where he's going.	CHITCHAT
He's going to exist on this beer can right here.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I haven't opened up dimensions in about a month, so let's see how this goes.	CHITCHAT
We're going to open up this file so if you look over here and you're seen your camera, your environment, and you have your beverage can.	O
And we're going to go to the can itself, going to double click and you've got two things.	O
You gotta pull ring material, which is your top material.	O
This one up here and you can adjust this color.	O
We can make it something really fun and it's going to give us this shiny kind of I don't know like.	O
Pinky tone if we want it and then we have our can material.	O
Now the can material is the actual body of the can.	O
That's what's down here.	O
That's this stuff you know do too.	CHITCHAT
Really super wild kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
This is really fun piece of software.	CHITCHAT
You can do a lot of cool stuff with this, so for a cane material we don't necessarily need to change the base color.	O
For this we can actually go ahead and just add something to it, which we already made the art.	O
There's a little bit of smoke and mirrors that can occur here.	O
You can either make a full rack to go around this thing, or you can just kind of like size it up and make it look good.	O
We're going to do that one.	O
I hate this little guy right here.	CHITCHAT
This will toggle tablet.	CHITCHAT
Please graphic on modeling to navigate to our graphics.	O
So we're going to work fresh date and we're going to go to design AI.	O

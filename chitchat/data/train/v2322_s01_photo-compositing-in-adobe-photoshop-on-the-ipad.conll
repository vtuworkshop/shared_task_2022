If you have limited budget or even we will forget about all current situation.	O
Sometimes we have.	O
A plan, an example in our plane allows us to download 10 images per month and but if you have only one image or left till next month and how you can download only one image, it creates something very beautiful and special using only one image.	O
So in this case.	O
You can use as your background your mobile device camera.	O
Example guys let me show it to you.	O
I will click on camera and just like that, yes I will allow an.	O
I will bone point my camera anywhere I like.	O
Inside the house, because right now we all are inside the house or apt.	O
I will click and take picture using my mobile device.	O
my iPad pro an I will be using this image as my background image.	O
So guys this is uh one away I will cancel it so you don't have to buy 2 images to create something you can buy only one image and use your mobile device camera to take picture around you.	O
To use this image as your background.	O

Again.	O
Photoshop on iPad is extremely smart as photo shop on desktop.	O
Photo shop knows that probably I would like to adjust size for my image.	O
I can make it bigger or smaller, it's up to me to make decision.	O
First of all I will look around so I will be cause this image of a little girl reading the book.	O
Definitely she's smaller than adult and maybe I even will bring size of this image down just like that because she's a little girl.	O
Perfect, I will click down to accept a this alert an I don't need any other images so I will say photo shop.	O

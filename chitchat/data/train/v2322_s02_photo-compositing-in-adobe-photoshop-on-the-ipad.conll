I selected this a girl an I will click on a mask icon under my selection just like that and the volume.	O
For the shop did a great job, but yes I need to improve.	O
Uhm?	CHITCHAT
My masking didn't notice guys Photoshop creating um knew a layer mask, so if I would like to switch between layer mask an image I will swipe to the left to the right.	O
If I would like to just my mask I will swipe to the mask icon and I will be using.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I will be using brush, a softer round brush with black color.	O
I will bring size of my brush down.	O
I will zoom in my the command in.	O
Now guys I will it to size of these brushes too big.	O
I will bring size down and I will.	O
Print out this areas guys I can paint out between your hair.	O
To make perfect masking in everything but guys, I don't want to keep you here longer.	O
Than's supposed to be.	CHITCHAT
You can definitely do a better job.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm doing, I'm removing a white background between.	O
Her hair just like this.	O
And maybe around here.	O
And here guys I made mistake.	O
Look I have a.	O
Painted out a part of your hand more than I wanted while I have my a brush with the black color, I will paint out a white.	O
Background just like that, and now I will switch color of my brush to wipe an.	O
I will paint a bag.	O
This area just like that.	O
And again between you need to switch between black and white color of your brush to eat just.	O
Your masking.	O
Just like this in again guys, you can do better job if you have time I don't want to keep you here a longer than it supposed to be and let me fix area around her or legs.	O
I will be switching between our black and White, a color of my brush.	O
If I need an, I need it.	CHITCHAT
Just like this.	O
You can make your brush size bigger or smaller.	O
Be comfortable with your tools.	O
And here.	O
We don't need shadows, so.	O
Just like this.	O
Now guys, she's I know she's floating kind of uh, no where.	O
But we are working on fantasy art and this is a this is a little girl in a big room of bookshelves, so it's library or her home.	O
Now we would like to.	CHITCHAT
I would like to create some store twice.	O
She's sitting on an because we are working on a fantasy art.	O
We will do something different differently.	O
I don't select my bookshelf learn.	O
I will creating you empty later.	O
I will switch color of my brush to white just like that and I will switch my brush to another photo shop on iPad.	O
Brush guys.	O
All brushes are dippold brushes in Photoshop.	O
You don't need to export anything else.	O
I will click on a mixed mixed spotter brush.	O
And I will increase the size of my brush.	O
About 198 aurum, a little bit bigger, just like that I will increase in value on a positive value in everything like that and now good morning, good morning and now guys.	O
I will paint this a cloud under our girl reading the book.	O
Just look at this.	CHITCHAT
How beautiful is it?	CHITCHAT
Yes, now she's floating.	O
Uh on this uhm.	CHITCHAT
Cloud, but it's not realistic looking cloud because she's like sitting on top of it without any texture in anything like that.	O
To add more, more realistic touches to this design, I will create in you empty layer above my.	O
This a little girl layer.	O
I will highlight a little girl layer I will create in you empty layer.	O
I will bring size of my brush down and just like this I will.	O

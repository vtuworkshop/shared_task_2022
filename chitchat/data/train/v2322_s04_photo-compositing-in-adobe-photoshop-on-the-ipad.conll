I, uh, going through all my images, uh, an I'm picking up 3 four or two images completely not complementing each other, and I'm creating something becausr When we are working on a graph or photo composing, we are trying to.	CHITCHAT
I cried trying to use all images complementing each other.	CHITCHAT
It's easy, it's in our comfort zone, but to grow to create something unexpected and being a great artist or great graphic design, we need to go out of our comfort zone.	CHITCHAT
So using images completely not complemented to each other will bring us too.	CHITCHAT
Uh, to make us to think of what I should do to make those these two images of works together.	CHITCHAT

Andrea Be honest with you.	CHITCHAT
I'm spending a lot of time on Adobe stock looking for images.	CHITCHAT
I'm just you using for this particular.	CHITCHAT
Example I use went to see a hashtag, a keyboard.	CHITCHAT
I use a reading book.	CHITCHAT
I use uhm education.	CHITCHAT
You can use any keyboard you can play with them and sometimes are spending 345 hours.	CHITCHAT
Before I will find image, I extremely love Adobe stock has a lot of images in lot of assets.	O
You can find anything you like Becauses I don't stock has so many assets.	O
It's a difficult to pick, uh, some uhm favorite becausr be honest.	CHITCHAT
I love many of them and I'm photographer.	CHITCHAT
But still I don't have a lot of time and it's impossible to have all image you would like to work with.	CHITCHAT
They are taken by yourself by ourselves, so even as photographer, I'm always, always, always buying assets from Adobe Stock and I'm extremely happy I love it.	CHITCHAT
Also, I'm Adobe stock contributor so.	CHITCHAT

Uh, uh, you know but.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes when I'm trying to create something new or when I'm preparing to my live streams and you ask me about something and I want to try a few images for my life stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm starting with one search.	CHITCHAT
I'm starting with some idea in my head and after spending 10 minutes minutes on it, overstock and seeing all these images, I have completely different idea.	CHITCHAT
So start with some idea and go.	CHITCHAT
Search on The Voice talk and I can guarantee you will find anything you like.	CHITCHAT

Bing uh, on a low budget doesn't mean you cannot create anything.	CHITCHAT

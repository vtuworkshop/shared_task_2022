We're going to do my top there we go.	CHITCHAT
Top ten illustrator tips first one I actually use is going full screen and hiding everything in illustrator because this is a fairly new but we go to window, there's presentation mode and I know it doesn't have a shortcut next to it, but basically it's shift F will bring you into presentation mode, 'cause chances are you have all this junk on the sides.	O
Like logos and copies of text and things like that and this just makes it look more presentable as you kind of present your design, so that's typically what I'll do.	O
I'll remove those, that's my just first quick tip since I was presenting this slide.	O
Now let's get into this.	CHITCHAT
So another thing that you might run into, and I'm going to select all of this text and I'll go over here and I'll just pick a color right?	O
And let's crank up that color a lot right under my properties panel.	O
Check out the stroke.	O
Make sure that stroke is on the outside as well, but this is what you run into.	O
It's like, hey, you know what.	CHITCHAT
It looks fine, and maybe I'll just kind of.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Make it a little brighter.	O
I would love to throw a little pink in there.	O
That's what it needs.	O
It needs to be a little more pink.	O
There we go right?	CHITCHAT
This is the problem.	O
This is what happens.	O
You run into this the it's no longer filled, right?	O
the T isn't flowing into the R and all that good stuff so this is a problem.	O
So what people typically do?	O
Is no break up the text right?	O
You'll go in here and you'll create outlines.	O
You can't edit it anymore.	O
It's a huge issue actually, but you will like make it 1 solid object.	O
But again you can't edit it.	O
So that's the problem.	O
So what you need to do in this case is select your text down here in your parents panel you want to.	O
Hopefully you can see that it's kind of small appearance panel right down here you want to click right here, add a new fill right?	O
And this is where you overlay.	O
That with white and guess what?	O
It is still editable.	O
As we can see, right?	O
So that's what you want to do.	O
Use the appearance panel, add a fill over it in.	O
Your text is still going to be editable.	O
Cool Papa new Guinean House.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Uh Michael J Welch, Awesome Serbia, everybody's here so this is really fun for me.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do a quick night scene.	O
OK, I have this text right here that is fine.	O
Right, let's just put all that text on its own layer.	O
Why not paste in place?	O
And let's just hide that 'cause I want to actually get into using the pencil right over here.	O
The pencil tool here it is just hit N for pencil right?	O
And you have these different settings so we can go from accurate to smooth, right?	O
And you can turn on a number of items in here, but I'm going to make this just like a Meadow scene, right?	O
So like.	CHITCHAT
Landscape and I'll keep it actually at accurate, right?	O

Initially I'll click OK.	O
Let's pick a nice color, just like a gradient, and now I can make like jagged mountains and every single jagged point I have is going to give me a vector point, right?	O
Like that will just kind of dragged down to the bottom.	O
I'm just using a mouse, will connect that like so right?	O
And there we have all of those points as expected.	O
Right, but that's what I use.	O
I use these options for my my designing right.	O
I'll have it kind of catch a little bit of that light like so, right?	O
And that's what I have right there?	O
Those jagged mountains.	O
The cool thing is, if I would decide I want to redraw any part of this, write a lot of people actually don't know this, but check this out as I roll over this line, it says, hey, you know what you can edit this part of this line, so you could just draw and get rid of that point like that, so you can redraw and reshape.	O
This all you want just by drawing over it super easy.	O
Hopefully you get the idea, but that's what I would do.	CHITCHAT
There we go in this case.	O
As I start to make this scene hit N for pencil, we're going to take it up A notch.	O
Just one we can draw some more Hills, right?	O
Some rolling Hills into a Valley like that.	CHITCHAT
This will give me less points.	O
Will see that come through in a second right gives me those sort of like less points as well so again I'm just creating this nice mountain range layer by layer, right?	O
We're going to get into this a little bit more.	O
Taking this down on this smooth Inns clicking OK?	O
And then just kind of drawing out another sort of Ridge if you will.	O
You get the idea.	CHITCHAT
I'm just playing with the pencil tool makes life easy for me, but I want to get into more of my pro tips 'cause I have a lot I need to talk about.	O
But again, I'm just kind of setting up a nice little scene, right?	O
Controlling these pencil tool making.	O
It may be jagged and all that detail when you need it and then when you don't need all that detail.	O
Hey guess what?	CHITCHAT
Just change it over to smooth as you can see in this case.	O
I do want this to be a little more smooth, maybe not quite that smooth, but again, just kind of redrawing that part.	O
You get the idea.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's move on.	CHITCHAT
I got other things to show you.	O
How was there a moon in here really fast?	O
Just 'cause I.	O
I would like one in here right?	O
Maybe a little gradient like that.	O
OK, maybe changing these colors as well.	O
Let's change this to a white right and it could fade down into maybe a little bit of purple.	O
I don't know something like that, just kind of adding to it.	O
Alright, we can do.	CHITCHAT
We can do that, sure, alright?	O
Have that done.	CHITCHAT
I could throw a glow in here using graphic styles.	O
Just give it a nice glow and then we have our nice moon that's going to light up this this landscape, but I want to put some stars in here now.	O
You ready sand up from Croatia.	CHITCHAT
Awesome, Rodrigo.	CHITCHAT
Fantastic, let's get into this so many tips.	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at this.	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at the star of either way.	O
I'll go into the star tool and sometimes you're thinking Oh, a star.	O
do I really want this exact star?	O
Well, we can come in here and we can always as I drag out, I can toggle between different points so I can make this 789 pointed star just by hitting the up and down arrows is all I'm doing.	O
Also, if you hold down the option key you'll get a true star like so.	O
So I just gave this a true star.	O
Look if you will.	CHITCHAT
Let's get rid of this really fast.	O
Get rid of that outer glow.	O
Hum kind of deciding if I even want this, I don't know, but really I need to fill the Sky with this with a bunch of stars, so I'll use this one.	O
I also drew out this one that I kind of like as well.	O
We could see it off to the side right here, right?	O
I might consider using it.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure which one I'm going to use, but.	CHITCHAT
You know what I can actually make a scatter brush with both and I use brushes all the time, so let's grab this star.	O
Let's drop it in here.	O
Let's make it a scatter brush.	O
Click OK and this is what usually will happen.	O
It actually you can't have gradients when it comes to scatter brushes.	O
So That being said, and I wanted to point that out to you, change it to white.	O
Go into brushes.	O
That is typically the added element.	O
Let's drag it in their scatter brush.	O
Click OK.	O
Guess what?	CHITCHAT
We can scatter both sides.	O
OK so will have this.	O
Size be random, right?	O
Maybe 80, you know.	O
Actually, let's make it really small.	O
10% the size we could make it a little larger as well.	O
152% the size play with the spacing being random on both sides of the line and you just going to want to play with a lot of these numbers and be sensitive to how much it's going to scatter it right again random like so actually.	O

No, I don't want to rotate it.	O
Rotation is going to be fixed, will click OK.	O
Will hit N 4.	O
Pencil or I could use the pen, but here's the star that I have.	O
I can draw out that line like so when we get a bunch of stars using this scatter brush.	O
Here is what happens you ready for this?	O
Let me know if you have questions.	CHITCHAT
Good to see everybody in here, but this is pretty cool so I just threw out all these stars with this scatter brush.	CHITCHAT
But the problem is like if I go over here and I want to draw add more stars over here.	O
Right, I have to go back in and select that brush like each time so it's a pain.	O
It's like I gotta draw this other line, select that brush, give me a break, right?	O
I don't really want to do that.	O
Actually.	CHITCHAT
what I want to do is I want it to always keep the appearance.	O
So right down here.	O
Let me check.	O
I live, I'm live.	CHITCHAT
Write down here, I'm gonna turn off.	O
New art has basic appearance so don't default to that basic line appearance right?	O
Just give me the stars or the last used apparent every time I draw right?	O
That makes it much easier.	O
And by the way, all these stars are actually being controlled by the strokes so I can change the stroke of these as well.	O
If I get them all selected, selecting uh, let's just grab say this line right here, right?	O
Taking that point size down a little bit.	O
As you can tell, right?	CHITCHAT
Taking that down a little bit, just changing the size of those stars.	O
OK, you get the idea.	CHITCHAT
We made stars.	O
That was fun.	CHITCHAT
Let's move on, alright?	CHITCHAT
Ha ha ha.	CHITCHAT
That's funny, uh.	CHITCHAT
Do you have to create a new brush for the star effects?	O
Yes, I did create a new brush right over here, right.	O
Anne, I have about 1000 brushes in here that I end up using a lot so that's why one of my tips is basically using brushes.	O
'cause again I use them all the time.	O
Even this one.	O
This is a fun one.	O
Like if I wanted to have a snake in here, there's my fun little snake that's also a brush as well.	O
Right now we can kind of redraw whatever we want to do in that case.	O
Cool alright?	CHITCHAT
Let's get rid of that.	O
Let's move on another fun thing.	O
Since we made this starlets kind of have some fun with this really fast right?	CHITCHAT
Let's jump over here.	CHITCHAT
Let's grab.	O
Hours fun gradient.	O
I'm going to do this.	CHITCHAT
This is just kind of a fun tip I have.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make this star OK, but I'm going to hold down the tilde key and let me undo that.	O
Oh, that's really trippy.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Let's turn that off.	O
But all I have is this one line, so let's just increase this.	O
Let's do this ready.	O
Pull down the tilde key and then click and drag.	O
And as you can see, you're going to create duplicates of that particular star, right?	O
That's pretty trippy, right?	CHITCHAT
Just the tilde key click and drag when you create a star.	O
Kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's Scroll down.	O
So again, that's a super fun, but the tilde key does more things I want to get into that later.	O
By the way, notice how it created individual stars right in here, but I could always change this anyway.	O
I want, which is really fun.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's remove that brushes.	O
Here's another fun one.	O
Let's turn on this stuff.	O
So these are just like pro tips and tricks probably for these stars actually.	O
Let's do this.	O
Select same.	O
Selecting the same stroke color properties, I'm just going to change this to overlay.	O
Oh yeah, there we go, just change that mode to overlay.	O
Just making it look kind of like a fun story scene.	CHITCHAT
But what I want to do is I want to add a new layer and I'm going to show you what we can do with the.	O
A simple ellipse 'cause actually what I want to do is I want to have these Rays of light shooting out from this moon, right?	O
So right now I just drew a circle and we could see this line right here.	O
So see this line.	O
We have this nice thick line.	O
Properties panel you can see this 23 point.	O
We could make it 60, but check this out.	O
This is the cool thing as we go into these stroke.	O
We can change this to a dashed line, so will change that to a dash line.	O
Will give it a 20 points with a 20 gap like so we can up this 240 right?	O

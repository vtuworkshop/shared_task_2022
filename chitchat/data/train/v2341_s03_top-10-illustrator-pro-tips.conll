And now we're getting these crazy bands and let's really crank this up now as well.	O
OK, let's go up to 100 right?	O
Let's change this to 500.	O
Boom there we have this awesome.	CHITCHAT
These awesome like Rays of light.	O
And will again change this to say overlay for instance.	O
And now we just have this.	O
It's like burst coming out from.	O
It's a little intense.	O
I might need to change it a little bit more, but this burst is just kind of coming out from from that sun and it's a little intense.	O
I get it.	O
I probably want to change that a little bit.	O
Let's do just some nice softly.	O
It drop down the opacity.	O
Kind of like that.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
And even move it behind.	O
Some of the other things, so let's grab my moon.	O
Let's make sure my moon.	CHITCHAT
I think I actually have a blend mode on that move blend mode on that moon, but you get the idea cool.	O
Easy enough, illustrator is saving, so let's have it do its thing.	O
Wait for it, wait for it again, just fun bursts.	CHITCHAT
I can outline this and use it like anything else.	O
I would actually have that trail out by the way.	O
But let's just size this up a little bit.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There we go, let's do something like that.	O
Cool, that works so far.	O
OK, let's go into.	O
Some other fun things we can do.	O
So many things we can do.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's dive into this.	CHITCHAT
Let's add a texture over the tops lot of times what I'll do is I'll grab.	O
I don't know, just a if I want to add some texture to this I can grab a rectangle, go into say affect Gallery for this rectangle and choose something like film grain.	O
So this is what I'll do 'cause I want to give it.	O
I don't want to make it look like the everything that you see that coming out of illustrator or it doesn't have any texture, but I'm just adding film grain to this.	O
We can control the graininess as well, right?	O
We're expecting that click OK, right?	O
Keep in mind I can apply this to every object, but really I like to make it a layer over the top of everything to give it just a nice film grain.	O
So putting that over everything as you can see taking that down right there, wait for it again.	O
It is a lovely filter and let's change the blend mode.	O
Again, to something like overlay we could try and now we just have this nice texture.	O
Right, hopefully you can see that you see that texture just creates a nice texture for this particular seed, so I'm into it.	O
Alright, stop touching my face that is funny.	CHITCHAT
Wash your hands.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
So cool we can kind of step ahead, in fact.	O
We can even see this version that I made earlier, right?	O
We can see kind of a lot of those similar properties as we'd expect, but I might consider recoloring this as well, and that's why I love recolor artwork.	O
I can start with this original one, I'll lock down that that texture.	O
Let's just select everything.	O
Let's go into edit, edit colors, and recolor artwork right there.	O
Already think the colors are pretty good.	O
But you can easily see how we could jump in, may be locked down each of these color stop, so they are also going to be related and we can try some different scenes and we can go from day two night and change this.	O
So drastically, if we want to again going from night today in a pretty smooth move in general, right and always unlocking those colors, shifting it a little bit more, I can have some more dynamic range of colors.	O
This works on anything showing you that they work on gradients.	O
They can work on more things.	O
If I decide I want to even have some free form gradients, which is also one of my pro tips in here as I select this.	O
This sun, right?	O
I should really make something else, but again, let's just take this.	O
This just has a linear gradient on it.	O
Has an outer glow OK, it actually has a just a gradient going from.	O
White to transparent, so that's all that's happening.	O
It's just that gradient, right?	O
But let's go in here.	O
Let's select this color range.	O
For instance, I'll go into my gradient panel, pull this out, right look, I don't even need all these color stops.	O

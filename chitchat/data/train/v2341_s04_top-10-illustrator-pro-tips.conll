Let's pull those off, right?	O
Let's take this one.	O
Let's shift it more yellow and have this one.	O
A little brighter, for instance, but really what I want to do is I want to show you this right in here we want to make a free form and gradient clicking right there.	O
I should have drawn a bird or something else, but will just deal with this because I could.	O
I could have a radial gradient, but really what I want is I might want to have a highlight on this side.	O
So right over here will have a white there on this for this point right here?	O
Adding yellow like so and then for this bottom part we can dive into really tweaking this.	O
Into the color that I want, right, like?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's get it away from that.	O
There we go added this other Third Point right down here.	O
By the way, I can make a line too, so clicking right here we can make a line so.	O
Lines click.	O
Click.	O
Click and now it's going to create that smooth curve and this could kind of be more like a shadow, giving this a little bit more depth.	O
Haha Alright.	CHITCHAT
Now you guys are being funny.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so you get the idea.	CHITCHAT
Not crazy about this, but I did want to show you.	O
The ability to add freeform gradients.	O
I probably could have done it on a bird in here or something, but you get the idea and here's kind of the final illustration.	O
Let me.	CHITCHAT
I think that is it.	CHITCHAT
OK, uh.	CHITCHAT
Fantastic, do you guys have any question how to combine shapes?	CHITCHAT
We do that all day long I did it with these clouds right in here when we start combining shapes let me lock down everything and just play with a new layer right?	O
So we do this with the clouds.	O
Super easy to do, will make sure that it's just going to be white coming here.	O
Boom boom, let's just add a couple.	O
Circles like so OK we can select all three of these and we could easily use this shape builder tool right shape builder let's us to kind of determine what to keep and want to take away.	O
But I can combine these two circles like that, combining that little part like so combining that over there, you get the idea.	O
Throw gradient on there and that set up so you get the idea.	O
Thank you, Angela.	CHITCHAT
Thank you everyone.	CHITCHAT
I think I've gone for.	CHITCHAT
A while now.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I could you could see how I did this tree.	O
By the way somebody's asking about doing the tree.	O
I can unlock it.	O
Yeah, these are just simple spheres.	O
There's nothing really too complex about it by the way, just three simple spheres right down here.	O
We just have this, you know, base for it, so I don't really know.	O
I think what's clever about this actually is right down here.	O
Adding the shadow.	O
So what is this?	CHITCHAT
Will guess?	CHITCHAT
What if we go in the properties panel?	O
Or even my appearance panel?	O
Let's get rid of this in my appearance panel you can see that there's a Gaussian blur for that shadow, so I'll turn that off and you can see.	O
It's just that tree shape with a gradient on it, and the blurred sells it a little bit more and makes it look nice and I should probably put it underneath the tree, but that's OK.	O
You get the idea cool, I think that's about it.	CHITCHAT
There's more tips I have, but that's all I got for you right now.	O
Yeah, this is another thing I would do.	CHITCHAT
Another fun thing actually would be to add patterns on some of this stuff, so this is another thing I'd think about since we were talking about texture, let me just grab this.	O
I can go over the parents panel and I can add a new fill and in this case I'm going to add.	O
Sort of just a different sort of grain, so we have all these different options for these different little dots that we can add for this week and take this down to like soft light.	O
OG is no not not quite overlay.	O
You're not really seeing it darn it.	O
Let's just keep it normal, right?	O
But what I could do here is I can control.	O
The density of this particular pattern so I can grab the scale tool and this is my last tip.	O
Then I'm done or the rotate tool, but I could grab the scale tool and hold down the tilde key, right?	O
It's the Squiggly Little Line, and I can click and drag and make that pattern tighter, right?	O
Like that just by holding down the tilde key, right?	O
Same thing for rotation if I decide I want to rotate it differently.	O
Holding down the tilde key will allow you to rotate the pattern and not the object itself.	O
Alright, which is super helpful, and again, let's take down this.	O

Yes guys aren't you know that I love Georgia farm tool because it's easier to work.	O
I can adjust anything and an.	O
If you're just beginner, this is the best way to start a working always in illustrator now as you can see I closed my shape and now I would like to eat just shape of a bad man's face.	O
To do so I will highlight this courage of point and I will drag it outside just like that in maybe this one as well.	O
In now I'm really, really happy with a Batman face just like this.	O
I will log this layer just in case and.	O
I've now I will use a darker shade of.	O
Uh, is this color.	O
Huh, let's see, maybe something like this.	O
Well, let's see what color I will use.	O
Yes, a little bit darker shade just like that will click OK.	O
I will add this.	O
Color to my Swatch swatches panel in I will name it.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Batman's Face shadow.	O
Shut there just like that and now I will know about this.	O
Is Mike a bad face?	CHITCHAT
Batman phrases shadow because I will periodically come back to all highlights and all the shadows.	O
So and why I'm periodically looking uh, on ads in this way, because here guys on another monitor I have opened my Batman reference image.	O
You can use your imagination or you can use on.	O
Your reference image everything is up to you, so I have created in you empty layer and using.	O
Odd color we just created with you.	O
I will add.	O

Shadows in here let me a hide a my tablet for me it's too hard for this shadow is too hard so I will bring down a pasetti of Aziz's shadow just like that these guys are we can add.	O
A stand up.	O
We can add transitions between cars and everything.	O
But particular bees are Batman.	O
Um vector.	O
I prefer kind of bold colors and bold tried transitions between shadows in light because it's Batman now.	O
Let me bring this ability of my sketch layer, I will.	O
Add shadow around here, just like that using same layer.	O
Just like this.	O
Guys, if you have any questions just ask and again I will bring down our visibility of this alert shape of this shadow just like this in I love it and again I will lock it just to prevent an unwanted.	O
If I.	CHITCHAT
If I.	CHITCHAT
This transformation of this shape, now guys I would like to expand this uhm.	O
Elerin I would like to fix my first shape because now guys the are overlapping each other and I don't like it so I will move with just like this is.	O
And maybe something like that and.	O
We will make everything a prettier and, uh, technically correctly.	O
Just like that, this is our shadow now and definitely I will need to adjust second shadow.	O
I highlighted this uhm?	O
Uh, shape in.	O
I will adjust it just like this and I will.	O
Log the shadows and face our lives as a well hi Camilla.	O

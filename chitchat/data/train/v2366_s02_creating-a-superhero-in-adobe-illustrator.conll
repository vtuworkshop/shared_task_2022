You can create up vector a Batman in a illustrator.	O
I love love but Batman.	CHITCHAT
He's my favorite favorite superhero.	CHITCHAT
And again I will bring down his eye, build a pasetti offices shape but not too much as I did with two previous and shapes.	O
and I will log this layer.	O
Now let's talk about our shadows to create shadows differently.	O
I will create a Hello Jennifer.	CHITCHAT
I will create hello, cloudy.	CHITCHAT
How are you so to create UM highlights?	O
I will create a new empty leg.	O
I will use a lighter shade of a same color we used for our Batman face and I will add this watch to our smooches.	O
Just like I did something wrong so this.	O
Just like that, and I will.	O
And I will add to this support.	O
And now let's add some highlights.	O
Remember guys highlights and shadows are very important in any art in traditional, and a digital doesn't matter about a medium you are working always.	O
It's very important to create a shadows and highlight their super important there.	O
Close to each others are basically next to each other and because they are closed next to each other, they are creating 3D illusion there creating shape of your subject.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Uh, this is our shadow.	O
UM highlights order, and again I can bring down a pasetti of this layer as well, just like that.	O
Not too much.	O
And now I will add one more highlight highlight.	O
Iran his chin.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what we have in here and again guys, I will fix everything if I need after I will close as is shape becausr it's easy to fix anything.	O
If you are working on ways are kerchief tool.	O
And what I will do now guys, I will close this pass just like this an maybe double Click to create a straight appoint a straight line between two curative point.	O
Points.	O
And we can fix it right here without switching to any other tool.	O
Let's see and I like it.	CHITCHAT
I like it it some.	CHITCHAT
If you think it's too harsh, um.	O
I don't worry about this because we are talking about Batman, right?	O
Well, let's ad uhm Batman mouth so I will um.	O
A log this layer I will creating you empty layer.	O
Now I need to, um, decide what color I will use for.	O
Great Jennifer.	CHITCHAT
And uh, now guys I will specify color for Batman mouth.	O
Definitely a People's mouth has a different shade but again we are talking about Batman and I would like to use a darker shade so.	O
What shade I will use?	CHITCHAT
I will use almost uhm.	O
Uh, shape close to his mother, his uh, basic face cover a big by Becausr we will add a little bit more drama later, no later on and his mouth with this shade of color will look much much better.	O
So I will bring back this ability of my sketch layer and I will add.	O
I will create.	O
Batman mouth, just like that in again.	O
Guys, I don't worry if I made any mistake.	O
I can fix anything or later on if you are beginner guys don't avoid about how many Anchorage points do you have.	O

Any girl just point at anytime later on.	O
Most importantly just create this is top lip Batman leap.	O
Usually top lip is darker than a Bottomley because it's sticking out.	O

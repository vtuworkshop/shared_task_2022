Double Click to create straight line between two courage points.	O
And just like this and again guys we are talking about a Batman.	CHITCHAT
Everything is different with a Batman because we are creating kind of a strong personality physically and mentally and I don't worry about how smooth or my lines or colors transition between cars are.	O

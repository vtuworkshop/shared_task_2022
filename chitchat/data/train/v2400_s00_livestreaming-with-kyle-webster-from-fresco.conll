OK.	CHITCHAT
The Apple color to this drawing that I did yesterday, or I remember when I did this, actually not a little while.	CHITCHAT
And this drawing was done with the Belgian comics inker.	CHITCHAT
And I'll show you how that looks here.	CHITCHAT
The very first thinking tool in Frisco.	O
You go to the ink category, select the Belgian comics brush, nice as you can get these chunky marks like this.	O
As well as these really fine lines.	O
And then if that we're using has a squashed triangular shape to it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Really gives you the look of.	CHITCHAT
The line drawings you would see by artists that were heroes of mine like Uderzo who just recently died.	CHITCHAT
Week or so ago he was the artist on Asterix, arrested in Phoenix.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure many of you have seen that.	CHITCHAT
If not, look it up amazing artwork.	CHITCHAT
Specially love the way you Jersey would draw hands.	CHITCHAT
In any case, this was just this is not meant to be anything too fancy, I just wanted to add some color to this, but I wanted to show you all the way to add texture.	O
To the water colors that you use in Frisco and, uhm, I want to also tell you that myself and the engineers who work on the app.	O
One of the most common requests we get is for there to be texture in the watercolor and we are busy actively working on making that happen.	O
I assure you it's not as easy as it is.	O
You might think there's a lot of work that goes into it.	O
It's going to be great results in the end, but in the mean time I want to show you a trick you can use very easy.	O
To create your own texture to work with the watercolors, an get really, really great results.	O
And so I'm going to hide the line work for just a moment because I want to make this really easy for you to look at.	O
OK, so I'll hide that for just a moment and make a new layer here and watch what I do come over to the painting category alright?	O
And you select.	O
The color fill rush right here.	O
And then you grab a sort of like a medium Gray value, something like that.	O
And you notice I've made my brush really Big 990 pixels and what's great about these iPads now is that they can handle really enormous brushes moving at a very fast speed.	O
You're not going to encounter any lag at all when you paint with them.	O
So what I do next is I just.	O
Lightly.	O
Fill the canvas with that colorful brush.	O
Then I pass over it a second time.	O
Alright, again, I'm using light pressure here.	O
And then one more time in little spots here and there.	O
Just targeting it up.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And if I zoom in on this, you're gonna see there's this nice pulpy paper texture that's built into that brush.	O
And what I do then is I duplicate that layer.	O
And I set it to overlay.	O
Alright, so we come up here to our blend modes.	O
And I can set it to overlay and what that does is increase is the.	O
The contrast between light and dark, all right, but you can also play with other other modes.	O
Excuse me in could come up your color burn.	O
For example linear burn.	O
If you want more of a contrast effect so I could do color burn for this one for example, and then just knock.	O
The Opacity back a little bit, maybe like like that?	O
That's pretty good.	CHITCHAT
65 that feels pretty nice.	O
OK, doesn't really matter.	O
This is not a hugely important part of the process.	O
OK, but you do want to make sure that you have enough contrast where you can see the grain of the paper there and again, that was the color fill brush that I used to create that I duplicated the layer and we have now set this mode to color burn.	O
Alright, so group those together.	O
And I'm going to set the mode for this group.	O
Too vivid light OK?	O
Alright, now you might have to adjust the Opacity.	O
For now I'm going to set it at about 7576.	O
Something in that area.	O
And watch what happens.	O
Going to paint with watercolors.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Get my brush little bigger here I make sure I'm using uh, let's see I want to use this nice wash flat brush.	O
And just do a little painting.	O
All right now.	O
I'm going to zoom in here because what I want you to see is that really subtle texture that is now being added to the colour because of this layer above, I'm going to turn it off for a second.	O

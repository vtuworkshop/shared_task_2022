I want you to see the difference, so this is without that texture layer and that is with the layer and I'll increase the opacity of that so you can see at 100% what that looks like, throwing their color in there.	O
And you can really see how nice it is when you blend.	O
Colors together and get the wash is going.	O
What that looks like with that texture now if I hide that again, excuse me wrong later, here we go, just hide this.	O
So that is without that texture layer and that is with it without with.	O
So that makes a huge difference.	O
In the look of the painting, right so I want you all to give that a try.	O
Very easy, you can do it right in Frisco.	O
You don't have to import a texture or anything like that course.	O
If you have a watercolor paper texture that you like some kind of an image of photographs that you've had a scan that you've made sure go ahead and import that as well.	O
But it's really fun to make your own with the brushes because it's totally customized and you can control it to look exactly the way you want.	O
So I'm going to leave that on OK, leave that layer group on.	O
An 80 seems like a pretty good number for it, and I'm going to move this watercolor layer underneath my line art.	O
And we're going to just clear that layer, alright?	O
And let's turn our light back on.	O
So here's our drawing.	O
Now one thing I want to do is I want this I want the line art to not be black, so I'm going to lock my layer transparency.	O
Right and then I gotta change the color of the liner.	O
And I'm going to use a sort of a Brown.	O
Kind of color something like this that feels pretty good, maybe a little less saturated little were pushing towards the yellow.	O
OK, and I'll just grab a big round brush here.	O
Hard round blasted way up to enormous size like 700 pixels.	O
And then just color over my whole image.	O
And just like that, I've now changed.	O
All of that color from black to that Brown that I selected.	O
And now in that layer where I was painting with watercolors, grab my watercolor.	O
Same wash flat brush and I'm going to use a nice.	O
Color here based on where I just started.	O
I think I want to do a little richer something like this.	O
And I'm gonna set my my values now for.	O
How much water I'm using?	O
So I want to increase the flow a little bit and I think, yeah, 40s.	O
Probably pretty good.	CHITCHAT
I can make it a little wetter, like 5050% so halfway there.	O
And just start.	O
Throwing some tone in their big my brush a little bigger here.	O
There we go.	O
300 that's good.	O
And then I want to come on down to a lighter color, little bit more yellow.	O
As I move down.	O
And remember, I've got that nice texture begged in.	O
Above it, right?	O
And that really makes to me a world of difference in just the appearance of.	O
The watercolor paint.	O
We just zoom in there you can see.	O
How nice that looks with that paper texture.	O
If you want that to be a stronger, more pronounced, remember you can always take this whole layer group if you want.	O
And you could duplicate the layer group and now look.	O
Even more texture, right?	O
Up to you.	O
In fact, I kind of like the way that looks, so I might keep that, but I'll just reduce the opacity of this a little bit down to like 58 or 60 somewhere in that vicinity.	O
Hi Jane, thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT

I had work travel that got in the way.	CHITCHAT
And my family got to go without me, so I was very envious of them.	CHITCHAT
Hi marshy.	CHITCHAT
Is this new version that added paper texture dollar no no as mentioned at the beginning of the stream that we're working on that right now and I was showing a really easy way to.	O

To do that?	O
I'm making a selection here.	O
And I'm going to delete this area right there, see how he let us know so hard she would have showed earlier was I painted the texture myself.	O
I painted the texture using a brush and that texture was created using the color fill brush which is in the watercolor painting or the painting category.	O
Excuse me, I just went ahead and covered the surface with that.	O
Did a couple passes with it.	O
It has a built in texture of its own and I duplicated that layer a couple of times and set the layer mode too vivid light.	O
And that's what you're getting.	CHITCHAT
To get that nice texture over the watercolor.	O
So look how quickly you could put a little Sky like that.	O
Um, now for the clouds.	O
What I'm going to do is I'm actually going to dry this layer.	O
I want to paint over that area.	O
Still want to pick up some of that color though, so I'm going to use that same purple color.	O
Going to go deeper, darker, a lot less saturated, something like this.	O
And I'll make my brush a little smaller.	O
So I got some more control.	O
I'm just going to come over.	O
Here, like this and.	O
Add some color this way.	O
It doesn't have to be like terribly precise.	O
But yeah, so nice look.	O
Maybe do a little pattern in here.	O
I never get tired of watching these watercolors blend together like this.	O
It's so satisfying to watch that.	CHITCHAT
What are push the pain around?	CHITCHAT
Much at all move.	CHITCHAT
Really fun.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, a little bit here.	O
You may wonder why did I dry?	O
The layer first.	O
Well, what that allows me to do is the areas I paint just after the first pass.	O
I'm not going to get the paint blending as much an flowing into those areas in the same way that I would if I had left it wet, so just really useful trick.	O
So we're getting a little more edge control over the areas you paint.	O
Alright, so there we have it.	O
I mean it just took a couple of minutes and now you have a background.	O
This is going to be a short stream.	CHITCHAT
I've only got about 20 minutes left here that I can hang out because I have a lot of other things to do today.	CHITCHAT
Gotta prepare for my live stream at 5:30 PM eastern 2:30 Pacific where I'll be doing my drawing class draw along with Kyle.	CHITCHAT
If you haven't checked it out yet, all of them are now available.	CHITCHAT
If you go to YouTube you can just search, draw along with Kyle.	CHITCHAT
Or you can go to behands.net/live/students and we are collecting all of them together there as well.	CHITCHAT
Now even though they were primarily aimed at younger kids who are home from school because of the situation, we're all going through right now.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bits and pieces in there.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure you find useful and it's just fun to sit along and and draw with me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's move on with the colour now.	O
Alright, so I'm going to actually make a new layer.	O
It's always nice to take advantage of layers.	O
And I'm going to start painting on this background we have here.	O
Of course, one thing we could do is we could make a selection first.	O
Some of the areas we want to paint that we want to keep a clean edge, but I'm actually just going to go ahead and paint and then I'll go ahead and erase away what I don't need.	O
Since I'm on a separate layer so it's non destructive workflow now basing off of this this color we used in the Sky here I'm going to just move along the color wheel just a hair OK and then come on down.	O
I don't want to get you saturated.	O
With this color right now, so I'm going to go somewhere in this vicinity like this.	O
And then keep all these colors fairly bright, right?	O
This is like a comic with color that you don't want to compete with the line art too much, right?	O
Alright, so make my brush a little bigger.	O
Just start painting in.	O
Some of these areas here.	O
Go a little greener.	O
And a little brighter.	O
As I come forward here.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
Remember, it doesn't matter if I paint over the figure, I can always erase that away.	O
No big deal.	O
And when I get to this next area here, I'm going to go even brighter.	O

And what I've got going on here?	CHITCHAT
Remember, the Sky is pretty dark, so that means that the land that I'm looking at, the landscape, you know it can't be super light.	O
That wouldn't make much sense, right?	CHITCHAT
That wouldn't make much sense.	O
Now I've got this purple purplish kind of deep dark color.	O
I can use a little bit of that here in the background.	O
Just drop it in.	O
In a couple of places, right?	O
It's kind of nice to just do that.	O
I had a little bit of variety.	O
I'll come back to that green.	O
I've got my color history here so it's easy to grab that Green again.	O
Push it a little bit more towards green, little brighter.	O
And then come over here.	O
And add some color to this area.	O
And I'm also going to throw some yellow in there in just a second, so.	O
Just a couple of hits like this.	O
Not being overly precise.	O
And now I'm going to grab that yellow from the Sky.	O
Anne next, that in this is the lovely thing about working with these watercolors.	O
I can do the wet into wet.	O
Like that so fun.	CHITCHAT
And get all those nice.	O
Blends to happen.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Really fun to work this way.	CHITCHAT
Feels like I'm working with paint.	O
And I can do the same kinds of effects.	O
That I'm used to doing with real media.	O
Traditional media, right?	CHITCHAT
Whatever we call it.	CHITCHAT
In this digital environment.	CHITCHAT
Already now, what about this this Patch right here in the extreme foreground?	O
Well, for that I'm going to go even.	O
Even greener case, I'll start here, push it a little more, make it a little darker.	O
And then just make my brush little bigger and just hit that.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
And I'll do a little bit of blending with some other colors there as well.	O
Probably with that purple there we go.	O
Just throw that in, why not?	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And you know, there's a little bit of color, harmony and all that kind of stuff.	O
I'm going to drive this layer like I did before.	O
Just dry it right here.	O
And I'm going to use that same purple color to throw some color into these.	O
Bush is right this little.	O
It's a foliage here.	O
What's happening, I don't know if you can tell her not let me undo this for a second.	O
You can really see what's happening with the shapes because I'm going to hide the line art in just a moment.	O
Go smaller here.	O
I put some color down.	O
And I'd ride this area before, right?	O
Which means the new shapes that I'm painting, even though.	O
They are still interacting with the color underneath the edges of the shapes that I'm painting are clean.	O
They are not diffusing into and mixing with the paint that's underneath.	O
This is a really interesting way to work in Frisco that I think people need to take more advantage of.	O
They hide the line art.	O
So you can see what I mean.	O
See that so these shapes have their own clean edge to them.	O
Alright, so I'll turn this back on.	O
And now here.	O
Go back to my painting.	O
A little bit more color here.	O
And then do the same back here.	O
See, that might be a little too dark.	O
Let's see I might want to lighten that a bit, so let's just kick that up this way.	O
There we go.	O
Yeah, that's more like it.	O
'cause you know we are moving away.	O
From our foreground and we don't want.	O
To get too dark there.	O
Right, we want more contrast to be closer to the foreground, right?	O
Okie dokie I didn't make the rules folks, that's just that's what you're supposed to do.	CHITCHAT
Make that a little bigger, so easy to just size a brush up and down.	O
If I were working with paint, I'd be grabbing more brushes constantly.	O
Not Siri.	CHITCHAT
Kay?	CHITCHAT
Keeping it pretty loose keeping pretty loose.	O
Alright, so far so good now for this path I think I'd kind of like to reflect some of that orange color.	O

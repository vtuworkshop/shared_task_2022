That's in the Sky.	O
There may be some of this this right here.	O
I just make it a little richer.	O
Little richer.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
And throw some of that in here.	O
And I'll blend that with some other colors as well, so just a couple of patches here and there.	O
And then I'm going to go and.	O
Add some other.	O
Bits to it as well.	O
Throw it back here to suggest that that's carrying on.	O
Behind them a little bit.	O
And now maybe work with this color, this yellow recolor.	O
When a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, Jane.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
And then I'm going to just grab a touch of that same color.	O
Was working with a moment ago.	O
Which is that purplish kind of the color.	O
And hit a few more of these spots.	O
And look at that and get a little pathway cutting through.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
Alright for these rocks and for the mountains.	O
I want to kind of push a little bit more towards a blue.	O
Colour so 1st.	O
I'm going to find somewhere to start, so I mean.	O
The coolest I've gotten so far is this kind of purple car that I've got right now.	O
So if I push a little further that way is probably about as blue as I want to get it and not too saturated.	O
I mean, I could go a little further, maybe you know, I just want to go nuts here.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
I want to make sure I don't get a color that's just so different from everything else that it starts to feel really out of place, OK?	O
Alright, so let's try see how that looks.	O
I think that's going to work.	CHITCHAT
First one, look at my how dark it is to you know what gotta go?	O
A little lighter in that since we are moving backwards in space, right?	O
This is farther away.	O
Alright, let's try this.	O
There we go.	O
I think that's OK.	CHITCHAT
And remember, this layer is dry here.	O
It will still pick up some color.	O
But The edges of the shapes I paint should be pretty safe, and I'll leave a little white space every now and then.	O
Just like I would anyway.	O
If I were painting with watercolor.	O
Just looks better that way, just looks better.	O
Is that same color?	O
With these rocks case so we can bring that forward.	O
And not have it be totally living on its own.	O
Back there, OK?	O
This.	CHITCHAT
And this rock back here like that.	O
Alright, we're almost there, right?	CHITCHAT
Not too tough now that read that we used at the beginning.	CHITCHAT
Warm that up a little bit and desaturate.	O
It can have it be too crazy.	CHITCHAT
And I was hoping to use that for this guys clothing here so.	O
First thing I'm going to grab my eraser and just erase away what I don't need.	O
So easy, I feel like I'm cheating.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes when I erase watercolors, what a crazy idea.	CHITCHAT
Crazy, crazy crazy.	CHITCHAT
Let's erase that away.	O
OK, almost there.	CHITCHAT
And just as before you know, working with layers, layers are so useful, so beneficial.	O
I will go ahead an on a separate layer for this guy.	O
Are paint him.	O
So let's do that.	O
Will make any layer.	O
Come over the top of this.	O
And throw in some color here for.	O
This guy just like that.	O
And I'll grab a bit of that, uhm?	O
Color from the Sky that were mixed with the yellow, which was this little brighter since we're now coming into our.	O
Main point of focus here.	O
And I'm just mixing that here in there with.	O
The red you can see how that blends together so nicely, right?	O
And I go back to that kind of purple purple color from earlier.	O
Just brighten it up a bit.	O
And use that here.	O
For the face that look a little darker, careful and trying to make sure that I don't compete with.	O
The line art.	O
That's the main goal here.	O
Don't compete with the line art.	O

For this kind of drawing right, this kind of comic book, he kind of look.	O
I want the darks that are in the lines to be the darkest thing I'm looking at by far.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
James asking about do I take the colors intuitively or set of color palette beforehand?	O
Totally depends.	O
In this case I'm just.	CHITCHAT
I started with.	O
That sort of warm Sky, and then I decided to play everything kind of off of that close to the color wheel.	O
Remember, I once I had that moved to the yellow a little bit, I didn't stare too far away to get to the greens.	O
And yeah, there's definitely some some thought going into that where I'm being careful not to go too crazy on the color wheel.	O
'cause first of all, as I've said, many times my biggest weaknesses color I have to follow the rules or I get losten.	O
I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So I gotta be careful.	CHITCHAT
Sure, there are times where Allah I'll go ahead and set up a color palette beforehand.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely yes.	CHITCHAT
Even though this isn't really one of those times, I will do that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, go a little grayer for the boots here.	O
Still basing it off that purple.	O
So I'm talking about like just pick a color and then.	O
Desaturate a little bit.	O
Increase saturation, warm it up, cool it down, whatever.	O
Um, I'll go ahead now and dry this layer as I did with the others.	O
And then take that purple color.	O
I was just using.	O
Just do a couple hits.	O
Here and there.	O
Just sit, unify things, bring it in there, and I like that red color that I'm getting here.	O
So I'll make just sample it with my finger.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And just add a bit of color to the phase of the cheeks in the nose like that.	O
It's fun to do little things like that.	CHITCHAT
It is a little bit of color in the boots to there we go.	O
Maybe the Hill to the sword, use that same purple and just hit.	O
That's sort like that.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Not much else left to do to be honest, uhm?	CHITCHAT
I'm sure I could.	O
I could refine this and do better.	O
Better stuff here and there, but the only thing I want to do is.	O
Get some more that red.	O
From the very beginning, go to my Sky.	O
And use the watercolor Softap wash brush here.	O
Increase the amount of water.	O
I'm using a And throw, just throw a bit more red there up there.	O
In that corner is feeling a little bit kind of dull, not so great.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Pop pop a few bits and pieces in there.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
And if I really want to have fun, I could always add some spatter, right?	O
Drive this the layer that has the foliage and the path and the green.	O
Patches here and there.	O
I could dry them again.	O
And grab that wet spatter brush and just use pure water.	O
So I tap on this little circle here in the bottom right corner of my color wheel.	O
And watch this, I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I got a lot of water.	O
And I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't need a lot of flow here.	O
But I will just spatter here on the.	O
On the front.	O
See what that does, not fun.	CHITCHAT
As that really cool effect of water being dropped onto.	O
Paint that's semi dry.	O
And that's just a really fun effect.	CHITCHAT
Took it too far there.	O
You can take it too far, don't you know?	CHITCHAT
Don't over do it but.	O
Get some pretty nifty affects there.	O
I love that.	CHITCHAT
See what it's doing there.	O
It's adding even more texture.	O
Look at that.	O
Change does it look so easy?	CHITCHAT
It is.	CHITCHAT
If you haven't tried this.	O
Really answer anybody who's who's kind of scared of using watercolor.	O
Um, with the physical medium.	O
I think frescoes a great way to just get started playing with this medium that.	O
Can be intimidating and you know we'll tough to.	CHITCHAT
To become friends with.	CHITCHAT
Because you can experiment as much as you want in this app, and there's no penalty, right?	CHITCHAT
Just do it.	CHITCHAT
You have the power of undue.	CHITCHAT
At all times there waiting for you to just.	CHITCHAT
Take full advantage so.	CHITCHAT

I'm adding little spatter now and texture to the Sky.	O
I don't know if you want can see what's happening there.	O
It's kind of subtle, but.	O
It's pretty neat.	O
I could even with the same foreground here, just grab one of the colors.	O
Are using before an actually add?	O
Spell that you can see with the paint right?	O
It's another nice way to Add all the texture to your work.	O
Grab this darker color, throw it on the on the pathway like that, right?	O
That's fun.	CHITCHAT
Stater right there.	O
Maybe even throw a little bit.	O
Oh, too much Carl chill out.	CHITCHAT
I'm here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Uh, all right?	CHITCHAT
Well, I'll get carried away with this pattern.	CHITCHAT
That is the way I am usually what happens, but.	CHITCHAT
A little bit here and there never hurt anybody.	CHITCHAT
That's it, done.	CHITCHAT
Um, hey, let's say that you're looking at your thing.	CHITCHAT
It's like Oh my gosh, it's too bright, too bright everything's too.	O
Too bright and saturated and darker or whatever the problem is dark to bright to light whatever.	O
Don't forget, you can always take advantage of filling a layer with color and then adding some adjustment to it.	O
So check this out.	O
Let's say I want to cool everything down, so grab like a blueish grey kind of a color.	O
OK, grab that hard round brush I was using before right and just make it enormous and I was too big.	O
It's 1200 pixels and then just fill the whole canvas like that.	O
And then I'll set the mode of that too.	O
Soft light Right that cools everything down.	O
So let me see without without, with very subtle.	O
You need a little more powerful effect.	O
Go ahead down to Hugh.	O
Like this?	CHITCHAT
And then just knockback the opacity.	O
So take it down to like.	O
30% something in that vicinity.	O
Right, that knocks back.	O
All of the color there, so it's cooler, and it's also.	O
Less saturated Right, so before after so much you can do with these adjustment layers and I love playing with those to see what kind of effects are possible.	O
You know I could go to an overlay effect.	O
And then increase that cools everything down.	O
With the Reds.	O
Right, so look at this before after, before after.	O
Before.	O
All right, or maybe you just want to have everything.	O
Fake filter yeah exactly.	O
Maybe just want to do something like this you want to.	O
Fill it with a color that's a little warmer but more sort of like a CPS sort of effect.	O
So you do this, you just grab the paint bucket.	O
Anne, it's hidden.	O
I'm sorry, but right back on there we go.	CHITCHAT
Just do that.	O
Just paint bucket that whole layer.	O
And now go to again like you for example.	O
Now you've got more of a sepia kind of a look, right?	O
So I can knock that back depending on how much of it I want.	O
So maybe like around 40% of a filter that that is kind of a nice sort of a unifying.	O
Effect, doesn't it?	O
Alright, so play around with that as well.	O
Lots of choices.	O
Remember the very beginning.	O
We created a nice watercolor texture and I really think that makes such a great big difference when you're using the water colors in Frisco.	O
And let me just turn off my adjustment layer there for just a moment, and I want to show you what that looks like will group these together so without.	O
The texture I'll zoom in here so you can really see it watch this no texture there.	O
Look at the difference.	O
That's not bad or anything, right?	O
But look at what happens when I turn that on.	O
Oh, so much better.	O
Give that a try.	O
OK friends, thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for watching.	CHITCHAT
I hope you learn a little something and I'll be on today.	CHITCHAT
Adobe live.	CHITCHAT
5:30 PM eastern, 2:30 PM Pacific for my draw along show if you have young kids in the house, I think they really enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
We're trying to make this a creative exercise that kids who are staying home from school because of all the school closures in the 25 minute break, something they can draw along with learn a little bit about art today.	CHITCHAT
I'll be doing the coloring page will be different from the usual episodes, but next week back to normal.	CHITCHAT

I got beer again.	CHITCHAT
It is Narragansett as it was Monday when I did this one 2nd.	CHITCHAT
Want to turn off the space heater?	CHITCHAT
It's a little chilly in my studio space 'cause I live in a garage anyway.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I tap the top of these.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it actually works.	CHITCHAT
Folder doesn't, but of course I have it anyway.	CHITCHAT
Happy hour.	CHITCHAT
Friendly neighborhood Narragansett.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, what's up, Jay?	CHITCHAT
How you doing Adam?	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for tuning in.	CHITCHAT
I am drawing tonight in Adobe fresco.	O
If you are new to my stream so you don't know who I am.	CHITCHAT
My name is fresh cake.	O
That's how I'm known here on Behance Instagram and on that website URL it's right underneath me here so you can head on over there.	CHITCHAT
You can check out some stuff but don't go right now.	CHITCHAT
Stay here 'cause we're streaming so this is a stream that I do on weekdays called happy hour.	CHITCHAT
It is 60 minutes of illustration I draw in Adobe fresco on and.	CHITCHAT
IPad 9.7 inch.	O
It is the six Gen so it's kind of old, but it handles the app super well so no reason to change.	O
You know if it's not broken anyway, yes, I draw for 60 minutes and wherever we met at the end of the 60 minutes is where we net out.	CHITCHAT
There are a bunch of links underneath me this week on this stream, so go there, check those out.	CHITCHAT
I get asked a lot about the music so I linked out to the artist that made the song you're listening to right now.	CHITCHAT
I don't hear any music.	CHITCHAT
Let me know in the chat an I will address that and get it going, but you can go check out their profile on artless dot IO.	CHITCHAT
That's where I get my music from.	CHITCHAT
You can check that out.	CHITCHAT
You can pay to get stuff for like you know.	CHITCHAT
Whatever project you're working on, or you can just use the music for free to listen to its up to you anyway, so check that out.	CHITCHAT
There's also a link to a discord chat I just started that recently.	CHITCHAT
It's brand new, so if you're not in their head on over, we only got like 5 people, but everyone super awesome in it and helping each other out.	CHITCHAT
Basically the entire discord group is just all about like.	CHITCHAT
Sharing cool art inspiration.	CHITCHAT
Stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
It's just a fun community to be apart of so join the discord so we can all talk.	CHITCHAT
There's also links to my IG account and the website so head on over there, but I think first and foremost, if you're in here and you like what you watch tonight, please follow me here on the hands.	CHITCHAT
The URL is be hands.net backslash fresh cake and you'll get notified when I go live or some people said that's not working so you might not get notified right when I go live but you will be told that I went live and.	CHITCHAT

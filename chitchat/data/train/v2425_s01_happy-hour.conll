What's up guys how you doing?	CHITCHAT
Two regulars.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much for participating in the chat in the discord today.	CHITCHAT
I really appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
It looked like a Heather, and I think your name is was had quite a few questions 'cause she's new to the community and trying to, you know.	CHITCHAT
Kind of catch up to speed on what all is going on.	CHITCHAT
The world of the Internet.	CHITCHAT
So hopefully just to preface this, there were some streaming troubles.	CHITCHAT
Earlier this week I've been told that they should be resolved.	CHITCHAT
The team has been working on it and they are aware, but if I kick out, please DM me 'cause the trouble is sometimes my stream cuts and I don't know it says I'm still alive even though I'm not.	CHITCHAT
So that happens start hit me up in the DM start messaging main people in the discord hit me up there.	CHITCHAT
I'll get ping Dan.	CHITCHAT
I'll restart the stream pretty much immediately, or you know, as soon as I realize it, I think the other day I went like 5 minutes before noticing, but anyway.	CHITCHAT
I'll, I'll try to get it up and running pretty quick, so if you just hang around for a little bit I will go live again.	CHITCHAT
The theme of this weeks has been Tiger King.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to let's put my keyboard together, Tiger King.	CHITCHAT
03 A drew Joe Exotic I drew sort of Jeff Lowe.	CHITCHAT
I realized it was more of like a Geoflow Allen Glover kind of combo that hit man that he paid so.	CHITCHAT
You know all good.	CHITCHAT
So today I don't know what we're gonna do I think we're just draw that really like toothless Dude 'cause I can't.	O
I'm getting a little anxious to go back to my normal fresh cake style illustration of just like fun doodles.	O
So we're going to draw that dude today and we'll take it from there.	O
Maybe it's crap this evening, man, I'm sorry guys.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think everyone's internets running a little weird.	CHITCHAT
My internets been pretty rough too.	CHITCHAT
Oh, now is that your is that your gift that you made using one of my characters?	CHITCHAT
Also, what are you drinking?	CHITCHAT
Usually have a beer with me.	CHITCHAT
Man talk to me.	CHITCHAT
Let me know.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	O
Dude had a pretty roundhead.	O
Or tilt it up.	O
He's pretty Smiley guy, so we're going to get like a big mouth, and he also had like no teeth, so we're going to put those in there as well.	O
Hey, what's up Joshua?	CHITCHAT
Welcome back.	CHITCHAT
You were in the last three morcha.	CHITCHAT
Ooh shock top nice I love that everyone starting to bring their own beers with them.	CHITCHAT
That's great.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of the point of the stream, although I will say I am slowly running out of beer in my house with everything that's been going on in the world, and a lot of the distributors by me are out and not really delivering.	CHITCHAT
So last night I went online I found this app called drizzly.	CHITCHAT
Some people know about it.	CHITCHAT
Some people don't.	CHITCHAT
Either way, I used it.	CHITCHAT
To Purchas some stuff and they didn't have any beer either, so I ended up buying some liquor, so I think I'm gonna have to switch over the hard stuff at the end.	CHITCHAT
All this 'cause.	CHITCHAT
Now here I'm running out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah Jay, grab one, go to the fridge.	CHITCHAT
I love this.	CHITCHAT
I love that everyone is jumping in on this is fun.	CHITCHAT
Alright man, I'm going to check it out.	CHITCHAT
Will take a look.	CHITCHAT
Drop that link in the discord two 'cause I'm actually going to.	CHITCHAT
I'll copy it from the chat, but I'm going to lose it.	CHITCHAT
I'll lose it.	CHITCHAT
I lose it after I close the stream.	CHITCHAT
So make sure it ends up in that discord.	CHITCHAT
Or you can just send it right to me.	CHITCHAT
For message it to me in the direct message, so I'd look at a couple of pictures do to get an idea of what his teeth look like, and he's got two kind of close.	O
And then he's got one.	O
Like really far away.	O
So we'll put like these two over here.	O
Turn around him out a little bit.	O
Kind of erase that part there.	O
I don't know if you had any on the bottom, will just give him one, just in case you know.	O
It's not like a total Gummer.	O
We're looking up so that lip would probably hide his gum line, so we're just going to have like 1.	O

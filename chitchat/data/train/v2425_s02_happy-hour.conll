Kinda.	CHITCHAT
Put some like weird.	O
Weird rounded teeth in here.	O
So how's everyone feeling?	CHITCHAT
I hope everyone is doing alright.	CHITCHAT
Hope everyone staying healthy.	CHITCHAT
Let's see usually talk about TV shows and music.	CHITCHAT
I feel like we've really slowly exhausted that topic.	CHITCHAT
I started watching movies like that's been my big thing.	CHITCHAT
Now 'cause I just can't watch anymore TV shows.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
They're just getting tired so I watch Jay and silent Bob reboot on prime.	CHITCHAT
It's free mean Jane Silent Bob fans out there, let me know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah he had a couple teeth.	CHITCHAT
I figured that he's got like a few will just you know?	CHITCHAT
This kind of pepper them in closeout, the app, my bad.	CHITCHAT
I should tell everybody this actually really quite in case it was curious, this layout on my iPad.	CHITCHAT
This is like the main layout of what my apps all look like and as you can tell there pretty much all Adobe apps right here and then.	O
There's obviously.	O
Other stuff, but these are all the excellent.	O
The main ones that I use and the image on the background wallpaper I just found out was featured in the fresco Gallery here on my hand so.	O
That's super exciting.	CHITCHAT
Go check it out.	CHITCHAT
Go head over to fresco.	O
You can check it out if you go to discover and you slide over and you can.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
Take a look at the peace and give it a like.	CHITCHAT
Let's see was it as good as Moraz?	CHITCHAT
Yeah Joshua.	CHITCHAT
Jane silent Bob Reboot Fantastic Justice Goes Mallrats.	CHITCHAT
They even reference it quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
Jason Lee makes an appearance as Brody.	CHITCHAT
Can you remember bro?	CHITCHAT
Do you like to go to the comic book shop in the mall?	CHITCHAT
Fun fact, it's not a spoiler 'cause it's just where they end up going in Jay and silent Bob, reboot Brody now runs the comic book store in the mall so.	CHITCHAT
And again, I say it's not a spoiler 'cause they had that.	CHITCHAT
I think in the trailer they show him in there, so regardless you go check it out.	CHITCHAT
It was good flick.	CHITCHAT
I enjoyed it.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see and then he had like a sort of a haircut.	O
Kind of like a buzzed head.	O
So we're just going to kind of will just draw that stuff in later, like they'll be just like little lines.	O
I'm just kind of mapping out where they're going to go.	O
There's a lot of references actually for Kevin Smith film.	O
There's a ton of references in that movie.	CHITCHAT
To all of them, and then they obviously make fun.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty much a big roast on Kevin Smith himself.	CHITCHAT
They make fun of when he made Tuscan all that stuff and all their friends are in it.	CHITCHAT
All the cast from the original movie.	CHITCHAT
So like Matt Damon makes an appearance.	CHITCHAT
Ben Aflac is in it so it's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Refresco Oh, thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
I thought your Wooten Jane Silent Bob reboot.	CHITCHAT
I was like damn everyone's a fan.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thank you for the thank you for the route to the feature.	CHITCHAT
I was really cool it's.	CHITCHAT
It's not my first, but it's always really exciting when that happens.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Now you mentioned the one that was featured.	CHITCHAT
Also, I did use illustrator to finish off the project.	CHITCHAT
The final images to add some gradients and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I am hopeful that they'll get a gradient tool here in Frisco, 'cause I think you could use one would be really cool.	O
This dude looks like he is freaked out but I guess that guy was pretty freaked out like he had a really odd.	O
Sort of thing going on.	O
I should also point out that like I'm doing this from memory, I don't have any reference images, so the characters don't always look exactly like they did, they more just have like iconic features like this dude lack of teeth.	O
Guess we'll give my tongue right now.	O
Should get my tongue.	CHITCHAT
You know we're going to do like a tiny little, I don't know.	O
Oh yeah, Joshua New Invisible Man was great.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if anyone follows Bystrek Bystrek on or bystrek stuff on Instagram, but he didn't Invisible Man drawing recently.	CHITCHAT
It was really cool.	CHITCHAT
Is my weird, well goober of a tongue?	CHITCHAT
Also, I would be curious to hear everyone that's watching.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Everyone that's watching.	CHITCHAT
The stream.	CHITCHAT
You guys watching other streamers here on the hands, and if so, who are you watching?	CHITCHAT
There's a ton of good ones.	CHITCHAT

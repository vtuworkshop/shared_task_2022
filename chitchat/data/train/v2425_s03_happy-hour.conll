There's a bunch of new ones popping up right now, so I'd love to hear what everyone's everyone checking out.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Post that discord now.	CHITCHAT
I'll definitely take a look at it.	CHITCHAT
Sorry in the comments.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
15 minutes.	CHITCHAT
Anything?	CHITCHAT
If anyone tuned in after I started and didn't hear my whole spiel, all good.	CHITCHAT
You can go back watch it on the replay 'cause I don't want to repeat it 'cause they can get annoying for some people.	CHITCHAT
But I do want to point out some key things.	CHITCHAT
If you look below in the description, I have a lot of new links there that I usually don't post beforehand.	CHITCHAT
There's a discord.	CHITCHAT
Please join it.	CHITCHAT
We can talk shop.	CHITCHAT
And then there's also links to Facebook and Instagram or no.	CHITCHAT
No Facebook was saying Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I have a Facebook, I never use it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the Adobe live groups are really good.	O
They do some cool stuff on those.	O
Oops, forgot the time was not merge down.	O
Let's make that a little bigger.	O
Yeah, we'll bring him in.	O
This does not look like the guy at all, but that's OK.	O
I did see a really funny meme about social distancing.	CHITCHAT
By the way, I want to put this out there and it showed that guys face in his mouth and it was like here to here not appropriate.	O
But here to here.	O
Is appropriate, so getting the lesson on that.	O
There you go.	O
Jack, do you have a favorite streamer that you that you tune into?	CHITCHAT
It does not have to be me.	CHITCHAT
I'm not looking for praise here, I'm really that's legitimate question.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to know who you're watching and who you really like.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm always looking for new tips and tricks.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's grab the color so icy out these colors.	O
I did this on Monday, where I showed that I used the.	CHITCHAT
I use a CC library, have a Gallery called colors rule and then I save the color.	CHITCHAT
The color from the previous illustration, so I keep them consistent right into here.	O
Thanks man, appreciate you.	CHITCHAT
TuneIn.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's see.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to use the vector brush basic round.	O
It's the basic round brush and then I set the pressure dynamic and the velocity dynamic on so those are those checkbox there.	O
This was asked last week or notice that whenever I turn off one of them, I turn off both and whenever I turn on when I turn on both, that's because I really like to be able to have that paper future with with the pressure dynamics in the velocity dynamics.	O
If I'm going to shut one of them off, I'm probably trying to get a brush stroke that's going to be very consistent across the board, so I'll shut them off to make sure that the width never changes.	O
And we're going to start the mouth.	O
This is feeling good 'cause this is feeling a little bit more original out my smoothing.	O
I set it up I people always talk about my smooth lines and I gotta tell you guys, the software does all the work.	O
Like I say that every week.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Right, so there we go.	CHITCHAT
And let's see.	CHITCHAT
Start putting these weird choppers.	O
I heard that the dude got new teeth during the documentary, but they only used.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how true this is.	CHITCHAT
They only used his interviews of him with the bad teeth because that's what they had most of.	CHITCHAT
I guess you gotta like towards the end of production and he was like not happy that they didn't show anything with him with like his new choppers in.	CHITCHAT
So I know last time you said your style sessions patient came from 90s Nick Toons.	CHITCHAT
You got any good books or reference stuff for that?	CHITCHAT
That's a good question.	CHITCHAT
do I have any good books or reference stuff for like 90s Nick Toons?	CHITCHAT
Not really.	CHITCHAT
But if you hop in like I said, if you join that discord, I do have an inspiration section where I post a lot of stuff.	CHITCHAT
It's really good question.	CHITCHAT
I could dig up some stuff and post it there for you.	CHITCHAT
Z.	CHITCHAT
Victoria is really good Jack not to break my turn.	CHITCHAT
I thought she's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Anywho, Yeah, Josh will go back to your question about the nicktoons stuff.	CHITCHAT
I don't have any real references for it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I can offer up references for like Instagram accounts and things like that that I follow that.	CHITCHAT

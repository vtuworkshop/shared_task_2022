That I pull some inspiration from.	CHITCHAT
But I don't have any like books or anything that I regularly read.	CHITCHAT
Or like art books, if you will, that kind of showcase that stuff you know growing up like an even still today.	CHITCHAT
Like a lot of art books like those like coffee table kind of books.	CHITCHAT
That I used to really enjoy where the graffiti ones.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that helps you out at all with your question, but I used to use a lot of those for reference.	CHITCHAT
'cause graffiti art is something that's always really fascinated me for a number of reasons.	CHITCHAT
One, the colors in the characters always super fun.	CHITCHAT
Also too, like I just feel like I'd never be that good.	CHITCHAT
So I was like exploring that kind of stuff, so it's always been a really good resource and I find a lot of like the same things that I like those kind of tones resonate in that culture as well, so it would be a good place to start.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's clean up the slip.	O
Yeah, I feel like a lot of people that TuneIn Joshua myself are usually fans of.	CHITCHAT
We're all end up being fans of the same things this tongue is looking weird, but I love it.	O
Thinking this bottom part up a little bit.	O
There we go.	O
Class.	CHITCHAT
Always turned down.	O
By the way, my rough sketch 'cause sometimes I find a little distracting and when I do that kind of this kind of reminds me of like transfer paper.	O
Or Belham That's I meant to say when you put like Valium over top of an illustration.	CHITCHAT
Like this?	CHITCHAT
Who the top part looks little weird?	O
Screw that out.	O
There it is.	O
It's got popcorn kernel, or like a butt cheek.	O
I'm going to start looking for some references for, like that kind of cartoon area 'cause I'm sure there's tons of art books out there like I'm trying to see if I have any art books like in my vicinity that I use, but I don't that are like within reaching distance from my computer.	CHITCHAT
I will say that on the shelf over here there's a plethora of comic books and graphic novels, so if anyone's curious.	CHITCHAT
Virgin.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah it is a very like Gene Simmons kind of tongue.	O
Alright, let's see here.	O
So let's put in.	CHITCHAT
And let's.	CHITCHAT
Just add in some like obviously these things would be recessed a little bit so we gotta add a little bit of.	O
That idea that you know these little like overshoots that kind of help.	O
Expressed that looks like it's kind of falling out.	O
I actually really like how they kind of round up and go in, so I might.	O
Might try to redo this 2 three here.	O
In this gum line that I added.	O
There we go.	O
It's weird actually.	CHITCHAT
Now this side the line is kind of little bulging, funky I'm not going to worry about it too much 'cause I'm going to fill that part in with black.	O
And you're not going to really notice.	O
So that's called cutting corners.	O

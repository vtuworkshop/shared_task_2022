And cutting corners is OK.	O
In my opinion.	CHITCHAT
If you can hide it.	O
Right there we go.	O
We got her gums.	O
We can.	CHITCHAT

So not quite a few people watching right now.	CHITCHAT
Just out of Curiosity, is anyone new to my stream?	CHITCHAT
Does anyone have any questions so far pop in the chat?	CHITCHAT
Ask where friendly community there's a couple regulars here.	CHITCHAT
I think that would be more than happy to give you the warm welcome.	CHITCHAT
Let us know.	CHITCHAT
I just realized how fun these teeth are going to be to like shade.	O
I can't wait to get time.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's merge all these layers together.	O
Let's just get this mouth on one layer.	O
And we're going to fill in the center.	O
Alright, let's add some.	O
That's lips to it.	O
So I'm drawing with a vector brush.	O
If anyone is curious, I just use the basic round with a taper setting.	O
I do sometimes use the basic paper, but I never really touched these other guys like they're pretty fun brushes, but I never use them.	O
The real reason why I think it just.	CHITCHAT
Don't know.	CHITCHAT
I just I really like the basic round it's.	O
It's like it's just such a tried and true.	CHITCHAT

I think we're cartooning.	O
That's one of the one of the key things I never really talk about.	CHITCHAT
This kind of stuff, and I really should talk about it more.	CHITCHAT
Part of the funding cartooning is finding those little details and exaggerating them.	O
You know he had not a lot of teeth.	O
Well, those teeth presumably are going to be hanging in there that well, so making falling out.	O
I think I mentioned this lot on my last stream, but I'd really awesome opportunity along time ago to take some classes at the Center for cartoon study in White River Junction, Vt and.	CHITCHAT
While I was there was like a summer class course.	CHITCHAT
One of the teachers said that cartooning is taking really complex objects and making them look really simple.	O
So you know the same thing like these are just two blobby kinda like popcorn chunks and just put him at that right angle, making it look like they're going to dangle in.	O
Fallout makes it really kind of pop and make something that could be really complex really simple.	O

This is a really simple.	CHITCHAT
I draw.	CHITCHAT
My nose is pretty much the same way.	O
There's like two or three distinct shapes.	O
They can range sometimes like so.	O
Usually it's like a little button nose.	O
Is there really easy?	CHITCHAT
It's just like a little circle and then another one down here and then you add your folds as you see fit to help kind of bringing together the other knows is more of A.	O
Kind of a closed shape and it's it's something like it's kind of like a Bert and Ernie knows where it kind of close up like that.	O
It's it's right on top of the face between the eyes that always kind of creates a really cool sort of effect.	O
And you can also change the color, which is nice, and the third nodes is always like.	O
Not going to draw it, 'cause if it's not on the face looks extremely phallic so we can keep it at.	O
I'll see.	CHITCHAT
OJ plays guitar OK, cool Joshua.	CHITCHAT
You play the banjo.	CHITCHAT
That's bad as I've always wanted to learn how to play the banjo.	CHITCHAT
I actually.	CHITCHAT
I listen to a lot of like low fi hip hop, kinda vaporwave stuff.	CHITCHAT
I also listen to a lot of punk rock kind of stuff but.	CHITCHAT
I really love like real folk music, you know, and banjo obviously fits the bill for that.	CHITCHAT
So that's really cool.	CHITCHAT
Do you have any tips or tricks and someone who is considering buying a banjo?	CHITCHAT
'cause I have thought about it multiple times and actually that would have been a good idea during this current team to get.	CHITCHAT
That would be something to do.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let me go back so I'm going to use this to create like another.	O
I call it a recess but like sort of like sunken in sort of vibe with his eye.	O
Almost drank my beer from not the whole.	CHITCHAT
Wait the 59 Les Paul Special.	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty sure I have that too.	CHITCHAT
I think that's why rock right over there.	CHITCHAT
I have a Les Paul is it the are not the rosewood, the Raw Wood one where it's like on a red and you can see it.	CHITCHAT
The town.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'll find someone then who will tell me, but thank you for the suggestion.	CHITCHAT
Bands were really cool man soap instrument.	CHITCHAT
So again, I use those circles to kind of create like a little bit of a recess in the eye.	O
And now we're just going to kind of merge everything together.	O
Boom, there we go.	CHITCHAT
It's like set back now that's what those kind of things indicate.	O
I can learn that trick from following an artist called Hatch art on Instagram.	CHITCHAT
If you don't follow him, check him out at.	CHITCHAT
I think it's just add Hatch Art he's from Australia or New Zealand.	CHITCHAT
Something that I think I hope I did not just.	CHITCHAT
Make that up, but he kind of does something similar with his eyes, and that's where I saw that trick and started doing it myself.	CHITCHAT
And it really does add a lot of character to them, so it's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
Batman, I was like when I draw good I it's like.	CHITCHAT
No, I'm spinning around the campus so much right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm literally going to place this thing.	CHITCHAT
Let's just feels more natural.	CHITCHAT
So is anyone out there watching?	CHITCHAT
Have any good tips?	CHITCHAT
While for quarantined people currently of?	CHITCHAT
Things to do that are not involving like.	CHITCHAT
The digital landscape like what's everyone that's weird?	CHITCHAT
Ask that question.	CHITCHAT
What's everyone doing to keep busy when they don't want to look at a screen?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Would be really curious to hear 'cause.	CHITCHAT
You know, watching through shows doing all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
Your eyeballs get tired.	CHITCHAT
Like I'm gonna play a card game tonight and we did trivia.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT

We use the computer for it.	CHITCHAT
We did trivia the other night.	CHITCHAT
Puzzles seem to be a big one.	CHITCHAT
So I'd be curious to hear whatever is whatever was doing what everyone's plan of attack is.	CHITCHAT
For non screen related activities, I guess it could draw on paper, probably like.	CHITCHAT
Got that up.	CHITCHAT
So I am doing these lines on a new layer.	O
Should put that out there I know.	O
Keep that where it is face is going to come in somewhere like that, so it would be cool.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I always work on separate layers.	O
I talk about this quite a bit, but for anyone who's new, always work on separate layers, so then I can erase and I can draw over and then.	O
Not doing a very good job at it in my own technique, but then I can draw over it like that and get a really clean line where it connects.	O
I'm pretty sure it's a studio, sorry, I'm reading mouse comment right now.	CHITCHAT
I remember when I got it, it says that's really bad that I don't even fully know what guitar sitting by me and it's less ball, which is really nice.	CHITCHAT
I got in a really long time ago.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't even know I was younger.	CHITCHAT
But I do love playing it.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we got this.	CHITCHAT
Got a fun.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't have fun like freaking out mouth.	CHITCHAT
So let's.	CHITCHAT
Let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Get another new layer.	O
Let's turn off the pressure in the velocity dynamic through test line that is not thick enough.	O
So we're going to raise the thickness rise up like 20.	O
22 is probably pretty good.	O
That's too thick.	O
I don't want that 20.	O
One thing I don't like about fresco.	O
The slider is like really sensitive.	O
All right, we're going to start on a new layer.	O
An literally just draw inside all those shapes that I made.	O
No, top his head is kind of lumpy.	O
Sometimes I try to get like a big swoop in and.	O
And it's really hard.	O
To go all the way around, so I use the kind of like the jaw line to the ear.	O
Look at the button and use the draw a line to the ear as like a way to try to like kind of get myself like a stopping point if you will.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And there we go.	CHITCHAT
So topic of the last stream.	CHITCHAT
Everyone was talking a little bit about their about hopping in doing the daily challenges here on Behance.	CHITCHAT
Is anyone watching participating in those and if so how's it going?	CHITCHAT
How you enjoying AM?	CHITCHAT
What's your favorite one you did so far?	CHITCHAT
Let me know.	CHITCHAT
Realize I just burped in, the microphone is like right next to my mouth, so I apologize if you want to start that.	CHITCHAT
No, I'm not using white.	O
I'm actually erasing the lines, so here's how it works.	O
I can show you guys.	O
You guys and gals how it's done, so we'll go with a transparent so you can really see it so.	O
To go over some functionalities in Frisco really quick.	O
When you make a line like this do do do right.	O
There's a couple ways you can erase.	O
They added two functions, and they're both really cool.	O
Let me turn on my pressure dynamics, 'cause That's how you're going to really see this, and let's let's add some other like, let's just make a really abstract kind of Blob.	O
One of the ways to do it is to grab your eraser tool like this.	O
I just tap on it.	O
It's right underneath the vector brush and you can just erase like that and it will maintain its gotta pressure sensitivity.	O
It acts just the same.	O
I usually keep mine really large.	O
The reason being is 'cause I want to have the ability to quickly switch to something where I can erase in a large area.	O
Now let's say don't want to race in a large area or I want to use the brush that I've been using.	O
Let's say I'm drawing something with a pixel brush and I want to use it as an eraser.	O
If you hit this little toggle right here, you can just erase.	O
Just like that, and obviously 'cause all the vector brushes maintaining it, you know.	O
Because I have a vector brush or something with texture, it'll keep that texture will act as an eraser and you can properly erase things.	O

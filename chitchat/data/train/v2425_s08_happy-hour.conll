So let's go to my bingo chunky eraser so I can get rid of this quickly.	O
There we go.	O
So that's how I do it so it's not white.	O
It's actually I'm actually erasing and I get the really clean lines and everything because I do it on a separate layer underneath.	O
And then I just kind of quickly remove it so.	O
You can see it in action for real.	O
We'll put our line in right here between to connect the mouth.	O
Looks super lame and bad and then I hit that little toggle and I just erase it right up to that line and I get the clean sort of connection between the two.	O
Just like that.	O
Don't like how that line looks, so like I'm going to actually lose this I don't know.	O
If I feel like his mouth should.	O
Like I didn't do this right, so we made this out.	O
Like let's see here.	O
I feel like I should do something like that, you know?	CHITCHAT
Or Do these lines just come all the way in hoopla?	CHITCHAT
Disconnect this right here.	O
Super weird, I don't like this.	O
Put this lines doing to figure this out.	O
Gotta figure out this part.	O
Well, that kind of works.	O
I only that right now.	CHITCHAT
Let me give this a little bit more arc to it though.	O
There it is.	O
She's got a big Dome.	O
Definitely made it a little bit too large, but that's OK.	O
We can work with it.	O
You know what actually we're going to lose the ear.	O
See, it's always happens after I like closeout, the bigger racer like I was talking about.	O
This always happens after I close out the rough sketch.	O
Always look at it like mass, way too large.	O
Grab the header grab from this point back.	O
Here we're just going to pull it over to drag this down.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Right now I'm jacking it up everywhere.	O
How do I do this?	CHITCHAT
No, I want to do this, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Alright, looks like we're going big head 'cause I Drew.	O
In those lines.	O
Now you know what?	CHITCHAT
It's just a.	CHITCHAT
It's not be lazy.	CHITCHAT
Can reduce stuff digital?	O
That's the point.	O
Reposition, get as close as possible.	O
Go and do some clean up real quick.	O
Not much.	O
This is multiple reasons why I like working in a digital medium.	O
It's really fast to just fix stuff.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
You know?	CHITCHAT
Sweet.	CHITCHAT
Alrighty.	CHITCHAT
Oh, let's clean this up.	O
That would be bad.	O
And let's take a swig of beer.	CHITCHAT
So we are 45 minutes into the stream.	CHITCHAT
This is happy hour.	CHITCHAT
60 minutes of drawing wherever we net out is where we net out.	CHITCHAT
I am realizing right now we gotta add some color to this guy.	O
We gotta finish up this line work.	O
We gotta add detail.	O
We got a lot of stuff to do so.	O
You know what I think like?	CHITCHAT

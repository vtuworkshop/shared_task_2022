I always say this is the beginning of the stream.	CHITCHAT
60 minutes drawing and wherever I net out is wearing it out.	CHITCHAT
I have yet to not finish drawing on the stream, so I feel really obligated to get it done.	CHITCHAT
It's all good 'cause we got, you know, 15 minutes is plenty of time to finish this up.	CHITCHAT
We're just going to have a little quicker.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
Now I love coffee, but I don't drink Starbucks but tell me about your Starbucks coffee was the coffee you got that you really liked.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to hear about it.	CHITCHAT
Coffee is fantastic.	CHITCHAT
I order from a place in New Jersey quite a bit called Brooke or I have a buddy who lives there and he brings it to me but Rook is really good.	CHITCHAT
So if you live in New Jersey if you live in the Red Bank area.	CHITCHAT
Which goes full circle with mallrats and Clarkson.	CHITCHAT
Jane silent Bob.	CHITCHAT
Check out Rook.	CHITCHAT
It looks really good.	CHITCHAT
They make a coffee.	CHITCHAT
They also ship.	CHITCHAT
You can get it, you buy it anywhere you want.	CHITCHAT
Or I mean not anywhere you want.	CHITCHAT
You can buy it from them, but they'll ship it anywhere like pretty sure.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's add some her in some detail on this guy.	O
So first thing first, going here.	O
He had like really short stubbly kind of a buzz cut so we're just going to do.	O
Menu layer with Opacity and I think what I'm gonna end up doing is.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
We're going to lines.	O
Crosses had to imply that he's got a buzz cut.	O
You know what actually now he didn't have.	O
Like short, let's just do this.	O
Lower my opacity.	O
Just to cover a large area, and then I'm going to go in and put all the detail.	O
Think I talked about this in my last dream.	CHITCHAT
One important thing when illustrating try to do the large areas first before you add the detail it's going to.	O
Oof, I feel like I just lagged out really bad.	CHITCHAT
am I still with everybody on the stream?	CHITCHAT
I was just staring at it for a little bit, but I watched it like cut out for a second and then things went pretty rocky.	CHITCHAT
So I apologize.	CHITCHAT
I do feel Joshua Go back to your question.	CHITCHAT
I do feel like I have a really good control.	CHITCHAT
I've used both pens.	CHITCHAT
I like the Apple pencil better.	CHITCHAT
But at the same time I feel like I I didn't ever give the.	CHITCHAT
The Surface Pen a fair shot, so I can't really speak to that.	CHITCHAT
If it looks like I'm having better control, you might know better than I do.	CHITCHAT
But I do like the Apple pencil.	CHITCHAT
I use the Gen 1 pencil so I don't know if that matters to anyone out there.	CHITCHAT
Also add some buzz marks in here 'cause.	O
Yeah, it's sort of shorter hair, obviously.	O
Alright, let's merge some stuff together here.	O
I'm not love that haircut.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go back and redo that at some point.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
He looks like a little kid.	O
Start add in some details.	O
They all had scruff, you know.	O
Sorry folks, checking my discord.	CHITCHAT

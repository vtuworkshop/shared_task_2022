Get all wonky on me so.	CHITCHAT

Recently But I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT

So.	CHITCHAT
Can you even imagine?	CHITCHAT
What it would be like?	CHITCHAT
To be one of the few people who have.	CHITCHAT
Spin.	CHITCHAT
To space CAS.	CHITCHAT
I used to have a membership to.	CHITCHAT
Houston Space Center But Yeah.	CHITCHAT
We don't live in Houston anymore, so.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of harder to go, and it's quite far away.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
These little things now these little sketches.	CHITCHAT
For now I'm going to tighten them up, but I'm just kind of like.	CHITCHAT

Someone's mowing.	CHITCHAT
And people are on the phone.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot going on and by people I mean that my wife is on the phone, in the other room.	CHITCHAT
Yes OK, Taylor by Patch I mean like let's see the old I can't pull anything up because I'm afraid it will stop the live stream.	CHITCHAT
But if you just type in like into Google.	O
Polo This.	O
Permission.	O
Patches.	O
It's really awesome.	O
Google search and you'll see like all so those are the main mission patches.	O
They're really beautiful.	O
One cool thing.	CHITCHAT
One cool fact I learned 'cause I when we went to Space Center Houston I was like.	CHITCHAT
Really curious about how they get.	CHITCHAT
Like How they get?	CHITCHAT
How the patches are designed.	CHITCHAT
I was I was like how who gets to do that like that would be a dream job like a total dream job to design one of those and I found out that the each time like they gonna mission the astronauts work with an artist and they talked to them and they get to basically design the Patch and then someone creates it which I thought was really cool.	CHITCHAT
So for when I mean patches like, I'm thinking like creating our own mission an like wanting to do a draw along where y'all can like create your own mission Patch and then will share him.	CHITCHAT
So that's what I mean by Patch.	CHITCHAT
'cause 'cause I'm obsessed with the patches.	CHITCHAT
In fact, if you could see me and I was doing my live stream via like showing when I have my face in it.	CHITCHAT
I am going to be wearing something cool next time I promise.	CHITCHAT
Thankfully, today I get to hide and no one gets to see what I look like today.	CHITCHAT
But OK, I don't like the doom buggy.	CHITCHAT
I'm getting nervous drawn in front of everyone.	CHITCHAT
Let's move on to something different.	O
I do like the Patch.	O
I probably will do each one of these.	O
I think I'm talking loud 'cause I'm getting excited about this.	CHITCHAT

As I'm here.	CHITCHAT
Talking, talking, talking.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I am going to look up something else.	CHITCHAT
Let's look up the space helmet.	O
'cause I want to draw it from.	O
A picture and not for my memory like I always do.	O
Ann I got this really cool book.	CHITCHAT
That I would like to share with you all.	CHITCHAT

And I'll share.	CHITCHAT
I'll share like.	CHITCHAT
Pictures from there to you.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I do like these little like sketch moments.	CHITCHAT
I think something that was cool about like vintage patterns and things like that.	CHITCHAT
Stay.	CHITCHAT
They.	CHITCHAT
They have this like nice hand quality to them.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Again, I think if I have to stream through fresco on Friday, I'll.	CHITCHAT
Show examples of that for sure.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Space hammerhead Starbucks.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really getting against side view and I kind of wanted to do.	O
Actually, this is really good.	O
OK, it's funny.	CHITCHAT
I always I draw stuff I always feel like I draw people an.	O
Facing to the right.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's because it's like that whole notion of like.	O
Forward facing or what but.	O
I just tend to do that.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
It's funny because since you can't see me today.	CHITCHAT
I'm like.	CHITCHAT
Feel like I'm free to make anything any face I want so.	CHITCHAT
I'm like not concerned about what my face is doing and.	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty sure that might look hilarious.	CHITCHAT
One thing that's been cool from.	CHITCHAT
Streaming Well, I illustrate is like.	CHITCHAT
But do you have to kind of get over things like?	CHITCHAT
If they don't.	CHITCHAT
Look the way I want them to you like.	CHITCHAT
I just have to like.	CHITCHAT
Go through that process 'cause I'm.	CHITCHAT
Here I'm doing this live and.	CHITCHAT
And you know, like.	CHITCHAT
It's a nice way to show that.	CHITCHAT
Things take time and.	CHITCHAT
They're not going to be.	CHITCHAT
It may not be what you want right away where they could be.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, never know.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to imagine, so I'm drawing this from a picture with an astronaut in it.	O
Try to see in my mind what it would look like.	CHITCHAT
If there wasn't a gosh, darn it.	CHITCHAT
And what that would look like behind?	CHITCHAT
Said astronaut.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Do you have a favorite?	CHITCHAT
Thing to draw.	CHITCHAT
Is there anything?	CHITCHAT

Clicking on Google, looking at some pictures, something drawing.	CHITCHAT

Oh my gosh, but now that you say it kind of looks like a race car driver's helmet.	O
And I just read it again.	CHITCHAT
Makes me want to see was it Tesla like take the car up into space.	CHITCHAT
So basically a race car driver in space.	CHITCHAT
I find it funny.	CHITCHAT
NASA, my mom says NASA logo.	O
Well, I will be doing that.	O
Probably more like a hand drawn style.	O
But if y'all want to go, see.	O
A little a cool little Meatball logo.	O
That's what they call the one that's like the one with the blue the Meatball logo.	O
You can see where I changed.	O

This will be the beginning of.	CHITCHAT
All of my kind of space.	CHITCHAT

So.	CHITCHAT
Let's erase that y'all.	O
Seen that you can find my website.	O
And check that out.	O
Let me know what you think of it if you.	CHITCHAT

It's kind of a combination of.	CHITCHAT
That one and the worm logo that they have though, and that's like the red NASA that looks kind of like a little worm.	O

So I lost it.	CHITCHAT

Hi everybody, good morning.	CHITCHAT
Good afternoon, good evening, welcome whatever time it is for you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good day so far.	CHITCHAT
We are going to do some landscape painting today.	O
I just wanted to honestly just wanted to do some fun comfort zone kind of painting.	O
I love this kind of landscape environment.	CHITCHAT
I thought it be nice to take a day and just to do something like that.	CHITCHAT
We do a lot of studies here and a lot of times trying to push outside our comfort zone and try new things.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, it's also good to have those days where you relax and paint something you really really love.	CHITCHAT
So I know we all have different tastes.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if this is.	CHITCHAT
Everyone's favorite type of topic, but I hope you'll enjoy landscape painting today.	CHITCHAT
This is a nice Canyon scene with like a River and trees and foliage around the outside.	O
High-tech girl, how are you?	CHITCHAT
Can you hear me?	CHITCHAT
I hope the audio is working but welcome.	CHITCHAT
So we might have time to do 2 paintings today.	O
I'm kind of hoping for that, but we'll see how things go.	CHITCHAT
I have a couple of other landscape photos set aside depending on what we have time for, so.	O
Yeah, we're going to start with this one.	O
Hey Brad, it dreamt about cupcakes.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, did you get to eat them in your dream?	CHITCHAT
I hope so.	CHITCHAT
I hope so.	CHITCHAT
OK good good tech girl.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Just checking just checking.	CHITCHAT
So if you guys want to paint with me, if you like the reference image and you're interested in doing a study with me, you can find the link below.	CHITCHAT
The stream in the description there's a link to the original photograph posted by the photographer on Unsplash, and the reference can also be found above the chat.	CHITCHAT
There's an info tab.	CHITCHAT
You can also get it there.	CHITCHAT
Hi Michael, Hi Owen, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hey Mandy.	CHITCHAT
Welcome everybody, yeah yeah tech girl, you can definitely share the sketch in chat.	CHITCHAT
That's totally fine, so I'm going to make a new canvas.	CHITCHAT
We're going to put the I'm going to put my reference over here on the other monitor next to chat so I can see you guys and see the picture.	O
And we'll use pure ref to hold a little thumbnail.	O
View up here.	O
So that should be good.	O
And let's see what size are canvases so the size of the reference image was 1351 by 9:01.	O
That's not very big.	O
I'd like to work a little bit larger just because I really like this scene.	O
Maybe if it comes out great, I'll want to make a print of it or something like that so we can be.	O
It might be a little optimistic, but hey, why not?	O
So let's go 4000.	O
Actually, maybe?	CHITCHAT
Maybe not.	O
That much will go 3003 thousand.	O
Pixels by 2000 pixels that this is really not a great size for making a print.	O
Let's see if we go to inches.	O
Put this at 300 DPI really.	O
You want to take into account.	O
If you want to make it a print, if you know ahead of time you want to make it a parent, you probably should work in 300 resolution.	O

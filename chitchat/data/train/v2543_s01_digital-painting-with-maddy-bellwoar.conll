So let's do.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's do 4000 by 2300.	O
That should be enough.	O
If we do want to make like a small print.	O
And let me say this and then we will begin.	O
So that's my size.	O
About 4000 by 2000 pixels.	O
If anybody's interested, I get that question a lot.	CHITCHAT
So let's see this and then will begin.	CHITCHAT
I baked them but don't eat them all.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let me see this.	CHITCHAT
Let's check out tech girls working on real quick before we start.	CHITCHAT
All this is very cute.	CHITCHAT
Did you create this character or is this like an already existing character?	CHITCHAT
This is a sketch from tech girl in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Sketch for his upcoming Commission.	CHITCHAT
Well, best of luck with that.	CHITCHAT
And thanks for sharing the work in progress.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're going to get started.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to explain my process as we go through the painting, and if you guys have any questions let me know.	CHITCHAT
But I will talk about what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
Hi Anthony, Welcome I can read you in the chat.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
We're going to start with landscapes.	O
I like to work back to front, but most of the time I like to start with a little bit of a sketch.	O
So let's at least sketch stuff in and then will begin with the painting going from Sky and then closer closer and closer to us.	O
So I like to start with figuring out roughly where the horizon line is.	O
I think for this composition were looking at basically the bottom third of the canvas.	O
Maybe I made that too high, but we can move things around easily in photo shop, so I like to put the horizon line on its own layer like this, and then make a new one to paint everything on top of.	O
Or sketch everything on top of it.	O
Because you know, in case you put something in front and you want to move that around, it's a lot easier to not have to erase around that original line.	O
So I like to keep that line on its own layer, and then we go on top.	O
So we've got some.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to focus on big shape, so this isn't going to be a very fancy looking sketch, it's just trying to figure out shapes and where things are going to go.	O
So look at the shape of the water trying to break this down into the basic basic form that I see here.	O
Hi Brock, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Got the River coming towards us, then the side.	O
This kind of rocky.	O
Area here and then.	O
On top of that, we've got some nice fluffy foliage.	O
And again, these are really, really rough sketch, but just to think about where things are going to go.	O
And then we will really figure out the shapes in the painting phase.	O
Get into making things look nice.	O
I think my sketches often look like cartoons, which is kind of funny.	CHITCHAT
Hi Amy.	CHITCHAT
Well, good luck.	CHITCHAT
Take girl.	CHITCHAT
He was or a welcome.	CHITCHAT
Hope your day is going well.	CHITCHAT
Hey Machiavelli, good to see you all.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for coming over.	CHITCHAT
We're painting a desert scene to start off with today.	O
If we have the time will do another landscape after this one, but.	O
Yeah, I love these colors.	CHITCHAT
And I thought I'd be nice to do something to some pretty relaxing landscapes today.	CHITCHAT
So we've got these mountains in the back.	O
Trying to keep them roughly in proportion.	O
And then on a new layer.	O
So, so here's something as I go.	O
Sometimes I will erase out, like for example, if we don't need the horizon line behind here anymore and merge what we have.	O
Then if you are, if you lower the opacity on this, it's a little easier to draw on top of it.	O
So for example if I want to draw this tree now over here, if I lower the opacity of that sketch, that portion of the sketch, it makes it a little bit easier for me to see what I'm doing, so I don't know about you guys, but I find it kind of confusing when I've all the dark lines and I'm trying to draw on top of it.	O
So a lower the opacity of the background and then we can paint this tree or sketch this tree and I can see what I'm doing.	O
My day is great so far.	CHITCHAT
You know why I don't wait what happened.	CHITCHAT
I am very happy to hear good news so please fill me in.	CHITCHAT
I've almost finished putting together My Portfolio to go to art school.	CHITCHAT
Whoa, that's exciting.	CHITCHAT
That's super exciting regularly, Congrats.	CHITCHAT

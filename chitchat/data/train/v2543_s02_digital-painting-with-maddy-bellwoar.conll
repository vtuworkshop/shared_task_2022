Hi Kenny, think what day is today?	CHITCHAT
Oh it's April 1st right has something to do with that.	CHITCHAT
It has something to do with that, right?	CHITCHAT
I almost forgot today is April Fools Day.	CHITCHAT
Oh Man, I always people always get me I always forget.	CHITCHAT
At home, San help says, should I start choosing photo shop over illustrator?	CHITCHAT
It's your birthday today.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God, I didn't remember or no I I don't think I knew that that April 1st is your birthday or I didn't remember it.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
That's the case, but Happy Birthday Missouri.	CHITCHAT
I wish I could give you a big hug, but you know, give you an Internet hug.	CHITCHAT
I hope you have a great birthday.	CHITCHAT
Hope you get to do something nice for yourself today.	CHITCHAT
About 7 cups question.	CHITCHAT
It depends on what kind of Art you want to do or what kind of design you want to do.	CHITCHAT
What are you looking to do?	CHITCHAT
Do you want to do a digital painting, digital art, or do you want to do graphic design?	CHITCHAT
Tell me a little bit more about what kind of Art you want to do.	CHITCHAT
Because if you want to do painting, digital painting, then photo shop is a good option.	O
I think the best option.	O
But if you want to do graphic design web design stuff like that illustrator then both will be handy.	O
But in that case illustrator might be more handy.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Hi Roger, welcome, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, I hope you're doing well.	CHITCHAT
Happy birthday virtual hugs.	CHITCHAT
Yeah all that's so nice Missouri, that's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you guys are doing that.	CHITCHAT
Webcam party my sister and my mom were having a little webcam party the other day.	CHITCHAT
Nice.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we've got that reshape here.	O
And now we can bring back the rest of the background now.	O
Do a higher opacity.	O
And I think I might merge those layers together.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
We've got.	O
Our composition here.	O
I think this is roughly what I want.	O
So will start painting.	O
I'm going to put the layer on, multiply, lower the opacity.	O
That way I can.	O
See through the layer more easily and I will lock the layer so that I don't accidentally paint on it.	O
Let me turn the Opacity down a little bit more.	O
That's good.	O
Will lock the layer so this is just this.	O
Sketch is just as a guide for me.	O
I'm going to be painting underneath of it and eventually the sketch won't be needed anymore.	O
So I like to start with the Sky when it comes to landscape because it's the furthest furthest away it.	O
Usually it takes up a large portion of the.	O
Um, the painting and it's also sets the whole mood for the scene, the Sky, the light from the Sky, whatever time of day it is whatever type of whether it is that's going to affect the whole mood of the scene and how colors work in the whole rest of the painting.	O
So starting off with the Sky is a good way to start getting feeling for that stuff.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Gonna paint nice purple background, I'll just paint everything purple.	O
This can serve kind of his underpainting for the rest of the rest of the scene.	O
Spending my birthday, watching you, drawing some peaceful landscape while playing Animal Crossing, living a dream that sounds very relaxing.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad to hear that I'm glad to hear that Missouri sounds nice.	CHITCHAT
Hope you enjoy.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to get the right color here.	O
I'm not color picking from the reference, so it takes me some time to trial and error to get the right color, but I'm using the airbrush to create a gradient from the top of the Sky down.	O
So we're going more and more towards this.	O
Whatever this color is like white, almost.	O
All the way down at the horizon so.	O
A nice gradient.	O
OK, I'm going to merge that down.	O
So basically we have this now is our background and sketch on top of that.	O
And then we'll make a new layer in between those two and that's where we'll start with like the furthest mountain.	O

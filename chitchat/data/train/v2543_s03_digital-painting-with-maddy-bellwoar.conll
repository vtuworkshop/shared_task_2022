Then the closer mountain, and then probably the foliage and the water.	O
Ajax and welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome, I hope you're doing good today where painting.	CHITCHAT
We're starting with this desert Canyon and River landscape and maybe we'll do another landscape after this depending on time, but I really like this scene.	CHITCHAT
This is like this is a great combination for me because as you guys know I love painting canyons.	CHITCHAT
I like the colors, those warm colors and then the Purples.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
We're going to get a chance to use do do that and then also have a bunch of foliage so it's like all my favorite things.	CHITCHAT
Hi Allie, welcome.	CHITCHAT
I am using a tablet.	O
I have a Wakame Centriq 22 is the model that I have so I'm using the stylus right on the screen.	O
But there's a tons of different types of tablets out there.	CHITCHAT
If you're looking to get into digital art for the first time.	CHITCHAT
I would recommend maybe something.	CHITCHAT
There are tablets like into a style tablets from welcome that are a little bit less less expensive to 1st jump in, but let me give real quick a link.	O
In the chat, just in case it's helpful.	CHITCHAT
Actually I have this link is below in the stream description as well.	CHITCHAT
There's a link to a resources page with a lot of information, but beyond that I want to share specific link from that.	CHITCHAT
That group of resources.	CHITCHAT
This is a blog that does a lot of really nice.	CHITCHAT
Tablet reviews of tons of different types of tablets, different brands, different styles of tablet.	CHITCHAT
So check that out.	CHITCHAT
If you're looking to get in at 2 digital art and looking to get a tablet for first time, there's so many it's really hard for me to give advice on the best tablet for you, because for each person their budget is very different than there can be a lot of little things that can affect which one is probably the best for you, but you'll be able to find it there.	O
I think if you read through, yeah, no problem.	CHITCHAT
Your welcome Pilar.	CHITCHAT
Ellie Barack yeah, no problem.	CHITCHAT
If you have any specific questions, maybe I can help, but I haven't used a ton of different tablets so I haven't tried them all myself.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're going to start with blocking things in now there's a couple of different ways to do this, so if you're going for speed.	O
You can.	CHITCHAT
You can choose to make selections rather than painting with A paintbrush.	O
That's like a really, really fast way to do this.	O
You can make a selection tracing over your sketch of the area you want to paint in.	O
Like for example, this mountain in the background.	O
You can select that whole thing and then take a color pick whatever color you want, and you can kind of fill that in, and that's a very, very quick way to paint that in, but I think I might use brushes because the style I'm going for it isn't going to be so clean it's going to be more like.	O
Like a traditional painting kind of look.	O
Ah thanks you guys Rosa Manish.	CHITCHAT
Good to have you here if you guys have any questions let me know.	CHITCHAT
So instead of using the lasso tool, which I often use when I'm trying to paint quick, I think I am going to just take my actual paint brush and paint right on here to begin the painting rather than the selection.	O
So we'll see how that goes.	CHITCHAT
I want to show a tool really quick that I use often that you might find interesting.	O
Maybe, maybe not, but it's called underbrush settings.	O
It's called color dynamics.	O
I'm a big fan of this, and basically what color dynamics does if you go to your brush palette.	O
If you click this, if you look at the settings, there are settings of Hue, saturation and brightness jitter, so there's two.	O
Well, there's a couple ways that I use this, so for example, let me turn this up more so it's more obvious when you make your brush stroke.	O
Every time that it creates a stamp of your brush, it's going to slightly alter the color based on the Hue, saturation and brightness jitter here.	O
So you can make it a lot less dramatic.	O
You can make it something like this.	O
It's like barely noticeable, but it's still there.	O
The striping is still there, and this is kind of cool 'cause it gives a lot of little Hue variations and your painting, and it can look like more like traditional oil painting with all those all these tiny little Hue shifts.	O
There's a lot of ways to use this, but.	O
Instead of having it applied per tip, you can uncheck this.	O
And then as you paint, it's going to still apply this variation here.	O

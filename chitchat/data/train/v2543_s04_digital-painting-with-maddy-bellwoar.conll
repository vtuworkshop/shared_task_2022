But instead of applying it for each stamp of the brush, each brush stroke that you make is going to apply the different colour.	O
So this is kind of a way to give a little bit of a quick variation to your painting without actually having to change the color every brushstroke, so it can be useful in situations like this.	O
If you look at how this mountain looks in the background.	O
You know, if I were to come here and just start painting it, making these brush strokes if I have the color dynamics and apply for tipper tip unchecked then every brushstroke that I make here it's giving a slight alteration to the color so it kind of with me doing a little bit less work.	O
It kind of makes it look more painterly and like I've done more work here like a little bit of an impressionist kind of look to the painting so that's an interesting thing that I didn't know about for a long time that I recently have become obsessed with.	O
Hi Martin, welcome, thanks for being here Windsor.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good thanks.	CHITCHAT
Hi Anet welcome welcome welcome, good to see you all.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you have any questions let me know, but I'm going to explain my process as we go through here so the early stages of the painting are always going to be.	O
The Mecias Tan in my opinion, also potentially the most confusing because until you get everything blocked in in at least a basic way, it's a little.	O
It's kind of confusing to take in the whole painting that's part of the reason I like to get rid of the whitespace as soon as possible, and so that's why I kind of went with the Sky color and just covered the whole background with it.	O
If you turn the painting into black-and-white, you'll see that gives like a Gray look to the whole canvas.	O
This is just the value range, the level of light to dark.	O
The background is more in the in the middle range is actually still pretty late.	O
I color pic.	O
It's actually later than I thought, but the idea is it's not pure white.	O
Background isn't pure white and it's a little bit easier to pick your colors when you don't have a pure white.	O
It's a little bit easier to do the shading and things like that, so so we're painting now.	O
Just trying to block in the basic shapes of the Canyon Mountains in the background and I'm leaving color dynamics on the brush so it's.	O
Choosing all these crazy colors for me, which is kind of fun.	O
I'm going to go on top of this later and sort of rain it in a little bit and put the brush.	O
Put some of these colors more like pick them more precisely myself, but it gives such a nice.	O
First step.	O
Oh thanks thanks Missouri.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's one thing that I like about using the color dynamics is it brings a little bit of like happy accidents into your work.	O
A lot of times with digital you have a little bit in my opinion 'cause I do traditional and digital an in digital in a lot of ways you have more control over what you're doing and you can fix mistakes more easily than in a lot of traditional mediums.	O
So you have a lot of control, but sometimes the negative to that is that.	O
You get less of those happy accidents like things that you don't expect to happen when you're painting that kind of turn out cool so color dynamics is one way to introduce these.	O
Like little unexpected surprises into your painting, because it sort of puts some.	O
Colors into the work that you might not expect and things like that.	O
I also like playing with adjustment layers and things like that for the same reason is sometimes you get unexpected things happening that I can.	O
You can find something that you like that you didn't think about before.	O
Hey Carl, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Makes the initial block in less flat.	O
That's so true.	CHITCHAT
That's so true.	CHITCHAT
I would always blocking with flat colors and it it's hard to start to see the life in it.	O
You have to paint for quite awhile.	O
So this is a way to kind of feel like you can move along that a little bit more easily.	O
So what I'm doing right now is painting in the foreground here on these rocks on the side of the River, painting those, and there are a lot more muted in color less.	O
Less vibrant than the background, which is getting that really bright light hitting it, so I definitely want that contrast because I really want the background to like pop out and be really bright and vibrant.	O
So if we keep this pretty desaturated relatively then that will help the contrast between those to stand out more.	O
So I'm going to try to be reserved even though I like bright colors.	O
The colour dynamics are really does make it look like a real painting that's so cool I think so too.	O
Oh, thank you is fine.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much for being here and thanks for the nice comments.	CHITCHAT
Again, if anybody likes the reference image an you'd like to paint with me, you're welcome to take the image.	CHITCHAT

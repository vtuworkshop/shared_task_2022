It's below in the stream description or also in the info panel.	CHITCHAT
You can above the chat, you can find the link to the reference image there, and I know some of you might be busy with other things, but if you do have time to paint and you want to join in, then you're welcome to and you're welcome to post any sketches or paintings that you do in the chat and share with us and this I do.	CHITCHAT
I do this every Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
So if today is not a good day for you to join in, but you're interested in doing that in the future, then yeah, I hope to see you next next Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
Maybe can join in then.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
We're still in the early messy phase, but it's starting to get more fun.	O
Let's move over to the right side of the water, get some of these.	O
Rocks painted in.	O
I like to use a brush that is square or rectangular.	O
You know that has a lot of sharp edges.	O
I like to use these types of brushes when I'm painting rocks, mountains, buildings, things that have hard edges and that you want to appear more hard.	O
I think it's a lot easier than using a round brush.	O
Personally, I know some people are like all about the hard round brush, and that's totally cool, but I like a hard brush for stuff like this.	O
Feel like it makes it easier.	O
OK, so I mentioned earlier when I'm painting a landscape I like to work back to front.	O
So far this things first and then getting closer to us.	O
But there is kind of an exception sometimes sometimes and for me I think the water here is a little bit of an exception because it's so prominent.	O
It's such a big part of the image.	O
It look how big of a space that actually takes up in the picture, so I think I want to paint the water or at least start blocking in the water now.	O
Even though technically some of the foliage might be further back if we're going to go back to front, but I want to get the water out of the way, or at least start getting something in there for the water first.	O
So I'm going to do that and then will paint.	O
The foliage will save my favorite for lasts, 'cause it's definitely my favorite.	O
I love painting grass and foliage and trees and all that stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to give it a try, but I'm not sure if were able to post images here.	CHITCHAT
Hey, I see us you can.	CHITCHAT
You cannot post an image, but if you post your image anywhere else and then you get an URL, you can put the URL in the chat and then I can look at it.	CHITCHAT
If it's up to you.	CHITCHAT
But if you posted it on social media or on like injure or here on, be hands if you post it here anywhere on your profile then you can put the link in chat and then that's how I would be able to see it.	CHITCHAT
But you're right, I don't think you can just post the picture right in, that's that's true.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you Pilar, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this picture.	CHITCHAT
This reference gives a really, really good example of atmospheric perspective, so that's the idea that when things get further away from you, they're going to generally be lighter in value.	O
This is more obvious if we put it in black and white, so less contrast overall.	O
Much lighter and.	O
More color of the Sky in the atmosphere is going to affect the mountains, so like the trees are mostly appearing in their real color.	O
'cause I really close to us.	O
But these mountains back here there a little bit more hazy and purple so it shows the distance.	O
And I really, really like this effect in landscape painting 'cause it can give you the feeling that you're there.	O
So I'm going to make a new layer.	O
I think underneath.	O
This one, so I think it makes sense when I'm painting the water to paint underneath of this layer, so we're going to do that and I'm going to try to pick the right colors.	O
If you look down here.	O
So for me when I'm trying to decide what colors to use here, I'm looking.	O
At the bottom left and you can see that the water is almost the same value as the foliage in the bill, and it's only a little bit brighter, so I'm going to color pic from here and use that as a starting point and.	O
Maybe shift a little bit warmer, but this is a difficult one when it comes to painting water, like in a scene like this, because the water isn't it isn't blue, or it isn't the Aqua kind of color you imagine when you think of water because mostly it's just reflecting everything around it.	O
This water is basically like a mirror of the environment, so you see some greens from all the plans that we haven't painted in yet.	O
But they're coming, uh, a lot of greens in the water.	O
And also.	O
Reflection of the Sky.	O
So that was part of the reason when I chose the color for the Sky.	O
I just painted the entire canvas that color because I also knew that showing through to that color in the water and some other areas was going to be handy.	O

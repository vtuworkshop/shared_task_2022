So.	CHITCHAT
I'm sticking with a this big square brush for awhile because right now I'm just blocking in the very basic forms and I don't want to get too detailed, so I'm going to stick with this brush even though it doesn't give a very realistic look 'cause it's pretty big and Blockish, but I will will will be able to tone down.	O
Will be able to choose a different brush for later when we want to do polishing up and stuff like that, but this is like a trick that I learned from a traditional artist.	O
If anybody is familiar with James Gurney, he's a really amazing.	O
Painter and he does a lot of traditional work and traditional tutorials on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
His link to his YouTube and his book is in my resources page below the description if you're interested in finding that you can find it there, but his name is James Gurney, you guys might be familiar with them already, but he does a lot of teaching about color and light.	CHITCHAT
Has a book on that subject and it's something that he talks about in his YouTube channels a lot or his videos on his YouTube channel.	CHITCHAT
A lot.	CHITCHAT
But one of his one of his suggestions was for traditional painters to use the biggest brush they can.	O
For the longest time that they can, before scaling down to smaller brush an in traditional.	O
That's a little easier, because if you're using a big brush, yeah, you cannot.	O
If you're still using that brush, then you can only paint that a certain size.	O
So kind of restricts you there, but with digital.	O
It's a lot easier to switch sizes of your brush.	O
I have my brush.	CHITCHAT
That make the brush bigger and smaller.	O
Those are I'm using shortcut keys on my keyboard, so I'm pressing keyboard keys to make my brush bigger and smaller.	O
There's so many different ways to do this, you can use the buttons on your tablet.	O
If you have a tablet with buttons on it, you can use.	O
You can set your stylus.	O
You can set these two you know.	O
There's just so many ways to personalize your shortcuts.	O
So for me I have my shortcuts on my keyboard and I find that a lot of times I even when I'm trying not to go make my brush small.	O
It's hard because I have such a subconscious habit.	CHITCHAT
I'm like doing it without thinking, so it's really hard to control that, but I try to keep it in mind.	CHITCHAT
Don't go too small too soon where still blocking things in and we want to get the big picture.	O
So one thing that can help with that is not zooming in like I'm trying not to zoom in and I'm trying to keep my whole canvas visible 'cause once you zoom in then you're like going into detail on this one part and forgetting about the rest.	O
And eventually there can be a time for that, like when you're polishing up at the end.	O
But early on try to stay zoomed out when you're painting, so that way you're making sure that everything works in.	O
Respect to each other.	O
The colours and the values like the darks and lights there.	O
That they all work together in a way that makes sense and I like to have a little thumbnail version of my reference too, 'cause that helps me keeping them keeping them smaller.	O
The images smaller helps.	O
OK, so I think that's an OK start for the water.	O
I might actually merge these together now.	O
I like to merge often, but don't feel like you have to do this.	O
I just.	CHITCHAT
I find that if I emerge more quickly than I more decisive with my painting, I find it a little bit more fun and it I don't second guess my decisions and try to like go back and change things as much.	O
Mostly when I'm doing studies, I'll merge pretty often if I'm doing work that I'm really concerned that it comes out very good.	O
If I'm doing like some client work or something that I'm going to want to want to be able to change things, then maybe I will.	O
Maybe I will not merge as much, but in studies especially I merge pretty often just so I can kind of keep the flow.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Welcome everyone who's just getting here.	CHITCHAT
Welcome sharmin.	CHITCHAT
I hope I'm saying your name right.	CHITCHAT
Thank you AJ D.	CHITCHAT
Hey Tanager.	CHITCHAT
Well, thanks for coming over.	CHITCHAT
I like how the brush makes me feel like I'm in a poorly rendered game from the 90s, right?	CHITCHAT
Or like your take your glasses off or something.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we'll get there.	CHITCHAT
Will get there.	CHITCHAT
OK so I'm going to make a new layer on top of this one.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's finally add some foliage so.	O
I'm going to color pic from this color here.	O
This is about to my.	CHITCHAT
I feel like this is about the darkest.	O
Color in my painting and that's where it is.	O
So we have a little bit more room to go darker and I think we probably should go a little bit darker and we obviously want to come over here for to get a nice green.	O

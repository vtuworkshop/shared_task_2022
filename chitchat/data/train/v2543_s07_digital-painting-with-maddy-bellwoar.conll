So let's start blocking us in.	O
So one thing that I've noticed in painting a lot of foliage is that in the.	O
Shadows these greens will often appear more like blue, like a deep green with like more blue, or at least at least less saturated cooler Blues color, blue greens and anytime that you get a green that's being hit by the light, like if there's a plant that has light either shining through or shining on leaves, you'll often get a lot more like yellow green, so that's something to think about.	O
So I'm going to try not to get too detailed yet, but.	O
We're going to start getting into a place soon where I'm going to need to choose a different brush if I.	O
If I want to get.	O
The texture and the feeling of views in technically you can always just use one brush for the whole painting and just you're going to have to scale it down to smaller size and maybe it'll be a little bit more labor intensive to hand paint all the details rather than using like some kind of foliage brushes or things like that.	O
There's lots of different ways.	O
Pens on your.	O
Your style and your taste, but I found that experimenting with different workflows and different tools.	O
Is really fun and will help you find your style.	O
I'm still like doing that too.	CHITCHAT
I'm experimenting all the time like even this one.	CHITCHAT
This one is a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Is a little bit different I think.	CHITCHAT
I'm always experimenting and trying to see.	CHITCHAT
You know what we're going to figure out trying to find and you better workflow.	CHITCHAT
I guess my biggest goal right now is trying to combine my.	O
Egg wash.	O
What I've been learning from doing traditional painting and gouache.	O
I'm trying to combine what I've learned from that with my digital paintings.	O
I really love the look of that kind of traditional medium, but I love working in Photoshop and I love all the advantages of digital art so I'm trying to like as much as possible bring.	O
Bring some of those things into into the digital painting, so I'm working on a brush set right now.	O
I'm actually using it right now, but it's not ready yet to be like released for everyone to use its.	O
I'm still like testing and changing some of the brush settings and things, but eventually this brush that will be shared.	O
There is a brush set below the stream.	O
In the description there's a free brush set that I used mostly and for a long time up until I've been making this custom one so.	O
If you are looking for some brushes that are nice to use, I really love a lot of brushes in that set.	O
Thank you Martin.	CHITCHAT
I'll save just in case.	O
I do have just the control S, you know.	O
I press that a lot.	CHITCHAT
I don't even think I.	CHITCHAT
I am thinking about half the time anymore 'cause I kind of got in the habit of doing it, but.	CHITCHAT
When you change the angle of your stylist, does it change the angle of the brush or is it random?	O
So there are some settings you can use to.	O
For that to work, foster.	O
So if you go to the shape dynamics, I believe the angle jitter.	O
If you set that to pen tilt then it is going to take into account your angle of your brush.	O
I find some of those pen tilt settings difficulty use like I kind of like it to just be in the regular regular setting, but you can set this in many different ways, but if you set it to pen tilt then it will do what you're saying, but if you don't set it too.	O
To pen tilt then.	O
Then it will.	CHITCHAT
It will not that it won't affect anything.	O
So to take a moment and sort of.	CHITCHAT
Critique my own work here.	CHITCHAT
I think over here I've lost some of the interesting shapes going on in this in the reference.	O
I think it's too much of like the same shape, the same height over and over.	O
So let's try to do something about that.	O
Make it more interesting.	O
Maybe this can be a little higher up here and then kind of race out a little bit and make this.	O
A little lower.	O
And then have.	O
In this little tree coming up here with some space in between.	O
Sometimes when I'm painting I have to fight that little autopilot that happens where you just kind of painting and repeating the same shapes.	CHITCHAT

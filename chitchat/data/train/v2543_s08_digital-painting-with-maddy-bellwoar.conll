I don't know why it happens, but.	CHITCHAT
It does sometimes.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Same thing over here.	CHITCHAT
I think we can go a little bit more.	O
Brave with some of these shapes, this one can come up higher.	O
Alright, so now that we're painting in some of the green, another thing I'm noticing is we need to go a little bit darker on the rocks below there, so you could either paint right on this layer if you're feeling really brave, or you can make a new layer in between the two paint there.	O
I'm just going to pay right on the layer and hope for the best.	O
I, Richard said working in regular water cooler this morning, but after what you just said, I switched from a #6 Sable round to number 10.	O
Really let me check it out.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I hope you don't mind if I show the image on the screen here.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I hope that idea helps.	CHITCHAT
The idea of working with a larger brush for longer.	O
I've personally found that really helpful.	O
Kenny says, here's a Commission I recently completed.	CHITCHAT
Um Oh I.	CHITCHAT
I think Kenny.	CHITCHAT
I think you need to upload that somewhere and then put the URL in chat.	CHITCHAT
'cause it looks like it just taking the file from your PC but there's not currently away to upload images into the directly into the chat, but if you post that to your be hands or like social media or post it to imgur or something like that then you can take that link and post it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
But I'm sorry were not able to see your link.	CHITCHAT
But hey, I'm glad you're I'm glad you're enjoying your.	CHITCHAT
Your painting makes me happy.	CHITCHAT
I want to get into digital painting, but I'm not sure where to start.	CHITCHAT
Any tips?	CHITCHAT
Sure, I actually have a link below the stream in the description.	CHITCHAT
I'll post the link in chat too for anyone in case it's not showing up or anything like that, but.	CHITCHAT
This is our resource page I've just been collecting over the past six 6 1/2 years that I've been doing digital art since I first got involved in it and.	CHITCHAT
Things that helped me along the way an I add to it all the time when I find a new resources that I think are useful.	CHITCHAT
There's some guides on tablets, so there's some software and hardware information on there, and there's a lot of tutorials for like YouTube and so there's some free and some paid resources on there, so you gotta browse through it and see what you're looking for.	CHITCHAT
Oh I'm sorry, faster, I can tell you the abbreviated version of the answer.	CHITCHAT
Though.	CHITCHAT
Long story short, you can turn your angle jitter under shape dynamics.	O
You can turn your angle jitter onto pen.	O
I know, I'm sorry under pen tilt, if you do that then it will do what you're saying with the tilt.	O
If you don't then it will.	O
It will not.	O
So it's a specific.	O
It's a specific setting to make that happen, but it is possible.	O
You're welcome, Julian.	CHITCHAT
If you along the way, if you run into any specific questions, you're welcome to come by my streams and ask anytime, but that has a lot of like general info that I hope will help.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we're adding some darker shadows here and there's random rocks and things.	O
Some are bigger than the others, so it's nice to use the.	O
The rectangle brush.	O
Always find difficulties in grass and stone ground surface.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I find Stonean Rock really difficult to paint, so I understand on that one.	CHITCHAT
But hey, that's part of the reason I'm doing these photo studies as I think they do help.	CHITCHAT
So we just gotta keep practicing.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm able to see this link now.	CHITCHAT
Kenny, thank you.	CHITCHAT
This is Kenny's work and chat.	CHITCHAT

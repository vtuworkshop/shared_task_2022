Really nice work.	CHITCHAT
I like the textures a lot of very traditional feeling textures going on in here too.	CHITCHAT
Hey Jesper, welcome it is relatively knew so.	CHITCHAT
Open.	CHITCHAT
A lot of fun.	CHITCHAT
Find digital painting more enjoyable.	CHITCHAT
When I'm not trying too hard and let the brush flow, I really relate to that.	CHITCHAT
I really relate to that.	CHITCHAT
It's hard sometimes to let go.	CHITCHAT
You know 'cause you want to make good work.	CHITCHAT
Everyone wants to make good work, but I do think that my most enjoyable painting sessions have come from when I'm just kind of relaxed and not worried about how things turn out.	CHITCHAT
I think for me the biggest thing was.	CHITCHAT
Starting to do studies that I had no plans on posting on social media, like doing some studies just for yourself just for your own enjoyment and not thinking.	CHITCHAT
Oh this has to be really good because I'm going to share it or this has to be really good.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm going to make a print of it.	CHITCHAT
You know, just having fun with the art.	CHITCHAT
Just having fun with the study and being open to the fact that this might just be an hour or two study that I never look at again.	CHITCHAT
I have done a lot of those over the past couple of years that I never did before.	CHITCHAT
So so for some of you this might be old news.	CHITCHAT
But for me I used to put a lot of effort into every single painting, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I wouldn't do any studies.	CHITCHAT
I was only making paintings and spending a lot of time on the paintings.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't making mixing in any quick studies, and when I started doing that, it changed everything.	CHITCHAT
It really got me to relax more with my art, knowing that not everything that I've painted was going to be.	CHITCHAT
Perfect and letting myself make mistakes in those studies.	CHITCHAT
Took a lot of the pressure off so.	CHITCHAT
I definitely.	CHITCHAT
It definitely encourage everyone to do some studies.	CHITCHAT
Do some photo studies or some experiments where you really just relax and don't worry about the results so much.	CHITCHAT
OK, so here let's go over what layers I have real quick.	O
We've got the background.	O
Which is just this gradient that we painted with the.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Airbrush then we have this layer which is the water and the rocks and mountains and then this layer which is the beginning of the foliage.	O
But it's still pretty abstract.	O
On top of that is is the sketch which eventually we won't need anymore, but we still need.	O
Still need it right now.	O
This is.	O
Men DG brush.	O
That's Cute.	CHITCHAT
That's really cool.	CHITCHAT
This is one thing that I like about.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, this is from Sathish in the in the chat.	CHITCHAT
This is one thing I like about using digital format instead of or as an alternate to printed books.	O
You can have these little animations that really bring things alive.	O
I think that's cool.	CHITCHAT
I think that's really something.	CHITCHAT
Even just a little bit, just the snow coming down.	CHITCHAT
I like that.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's.	O
Get this tree blocked in.	O
I'm going to use the same brush just a little bit smaller.	O
And you know, maybe I should change my brush up.	O
I want to be able to get a point at the end of these branches, so let's do that.	O
Let's change to a brush that.	O
Let me get a more.	O
More point the end.	O
So in the reference you can see the branches kind of curve in out and around.	O
From Scotland welcome, thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
I've been to Scotland one time and it was so beautiful.	CHITCHAT
I've been wanting to go back.	CHITCHAT
I was Super Lucky I went there and family vacation.	CHITCHAT
And we had a great weather the whole time.	CHITCHAT
It was Super Sunny and beautiful.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I, uh people, the locals kept telling me like, Oh, you're so lucky to have this weather.	CHITCHAT
Now I live in the Netherlands, so I'm also used to a lot of rain.	CHITCHAT
Originally from the US.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm just painting in the branches I I've always liked to do the branches 1st and then add the.	O

The leaves, 'cause I find that it helps too.	O
Give me an idea where to concentrate the leaves, you know.	O
If I don't have, it's like drawing a person and kind of sorting out the skeleton first or the anatomy first before adding clothes on top.	O
You know it really helps you to know what you're doing.	O
I like painting dark on dark backgrounds.	O
Oh cool, so first of all, your work is awesome, but you're saying You started this.	CHITCHAT
On a black background, like maybe something of this color was like the background.	CHITCHAT
Nicely done.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I'm curious.	CHITCHAT
Curious, oh, I see at the bottom I see at the bottom so you started with the blue yeah, rather than a than a white white background.	CHITCHAT
I hope I'm understanding that correctly, but nice work.	CHITCHAT
Really nice work.	CHITCHAT
A related link projects here, not just inspiration, not my personal projects.	CHITCHAT
I prefer if people are sharing art that it's their own work.	CHITCHAT
You guys are.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I would prefer that.	CHITCHAT
I have a discord community for anybody that doesn't know, there's a share inspiration channel in the discord.	CHITCHAT
If you want to share stuff there, that's awesome, but if you're sharing here, I would prefer to be your own work that you have.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just to make sure everyone has permissions for what they're sharing.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we've got our tree.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a new layer and start painting some of the.	O
Leaves and stuff on top of the tree.	O
First, had the Sky is the background, but the last two are on darks cool.	O
Yeah I used.	CHITCHAT
I did kind of the same thing.	O
This one is all Sky background and then.	O
Going on top.	O
Thanks Jesper.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to color pic from the.	O
The tree 3 branch that's a nice dark.	O
Green Brown color and use that to bring a couple textures now.	O
So here's the brush I'm using right now.	O
This is another brush I made that I'm working on tweaking, but I like it.	O
It it gives a little bit of a look of dry brushing like I I like to use a flat.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Flat brush when I paint in Gouache and for foliage and stuff I like to.	O
Have the brush a little bit more dry and this is supposed to imitate that kind of texture.	O
So we'll try to try to do that up here too, so I'm looking at the reference to to give me some idea of how dense the leaves should be, and we want to keep it pretty area up here.	O
I think down here the foliage is a little bit more dense, but up here in the tree we've got a lot of space in between the leaves, and it's pretty pretty late in area, so I think I will probably either erase out or paint the Sky back in between, but they'll probably be a little bit of back and forth until I get the texture that I like.	O
But Yeah, I'm a big fan of this look.	CHITCHAT
Painting a little bit more more loose and the idea that hopefully this is going to look.	O
Hopefully will look like leaves or give the impression of leaves and branches, but I'm not painting any individual.	O
Any individual leaves.	O
Just something that from a distance will look like that I hope.	O
And you can take a different brush with a different texture an erase out that can create a cool look.	O
And again, with the happy accidents, this can be a way that you might use a brush that you don't know how the texture will react with the other brush.	O
So using a different texture to erase out that can make some cool effects.	O
Also, I like to flip my canvas.	O
I haven't been doing it a lot this.	CHITCHAT
Stream yet, but I really should be doing it more.	CHITCHAT
Flipping the canvas aurizon to Lee is a nice way to get like a fresh look at your image and sometimes it will point out to you if things are a little wonky, but it looks OK so far.	O
Brush that's a little bit harder shapes.	O

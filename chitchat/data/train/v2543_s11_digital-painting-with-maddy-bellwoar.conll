And.	CHITCHAT
Add some little kind of individual leaf type shapes here.	O
So here's something to note I've been painting with A green color that's a little bit lighter than the.	O
The tree trunk and the branches.	O
If I want the branches to still remain the darkest thing I can put this layer instead of on normal mode.	O
I can put it on dark in, So what that does is.	O
The what I've painted on this layer is only going to affect.	O
Um areas that are lighter than the color that I'm painting, so.	O
Basically this green is lighter than the branches, so it won't lighten them anymore.	O
Only things will be allowed to darken, not lighten things below them.	O
I hope it makes sense.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I.	CHITCHAT
Can turn on dark in if I turn it back to normal you'll see the difference, so this is normal.	O
And this is dark, and so it depends on what you're looking for.	O
I think I will leave it on normal mode, but I just wanted to play with that and see if I see how it looked to see what we liked.	O
Alright, so I'll flip this back.	O
Just wanted to take a little look from the other angle.	O
If anybody is painting along, I hope it's going well and you're enjoying a painting that's the most important thing.	O
Hope you're having fun.	CHITCHAT
Hi Steve, I am using a tablet.	CHITCHAT
I have a Wakame Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
That's the model of tablet that I have and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this kind of painting would be very, very difficult to do with the mouse.	O
It doesn't mean that you have to run out and buy a super expensive tablet, but I think a tablet would be needed and the reason for that is I'm using brushes that have pressure sensitivity alot.	O
So that means so if you look at your my brush palette here I have transfer checked.	O
So what this does is it allows me to press really light.	O
And then press really dark and you see the difference and you really need to have a tablet to be able to detect this difference in how you're pressing.	O
If you're using a mouse, you're basically going to have everything at like the full darkness.	O
You can go up and adjust opacity here, but it's a much more time consuming process, so while you can do a lot of digital art with a mouse, especially like vector art and maybe some matte painting photo bashing type stuff, I really advise if you're going to get into digital painting and you want a more natural look.	O
To at least just look into tablets, there's they've really come down in price, and there's a lot of different brands available so you don't need to rush out and get an expensive one, but a tablet really is needed for the type of our time doing here.	CHITCHAT
At least to make it.	CHITCHAT
More pleasant experience.	CHITCHAT
Hi, are a welcome.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going over some of the edges of these of the foliage and just giving them hopefully the look of some texture and leaves.	O
I like over here on the right there's some branches that come up a little higher.	O

This is a link to a tablet review website that's really good and goes over a wide range of beginner tablets and more experienced once it goes all the way down the line and he's got different brands of tablets and different.	CHITCHAT

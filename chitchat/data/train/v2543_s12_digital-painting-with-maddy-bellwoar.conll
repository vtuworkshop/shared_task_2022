Styles of tablet.	CHITCHAT
And I would look into that because I have a really hard time suggesting tablets because.	CHITCHAT
There's so many like for one person, their budget can be really, really different.	CHITCHAT
I would say I've heard a lot of good things about XP pen.	CHITCHAT
If you're looking for a cheap tablet that has a has a screen they actually have, I think the least expensive screen tablet right now.	CHITCHAT
So it depends on if you're looking for a tablet, the screen, the Wakame Intuos is a really good option for a non sweetened tablet.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't call it cheap, but for the for the.	CHITCHAT
Price you get a very good quality tablet that will potentially last for years and be able to scale up with you as your skill level grows.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of professional artists using the welcome intuos, and it's also good one to start on.	CHITCHAT
But if you're looking for a screen tablet and you don't want to spend too much money, I think XP pen is really good.	CHITCHAT
But I haven't tried them myself so far I've been.	CHITCHAT
I've been using walk home all the way through so I can only recommend based on reviews that I've watched and what I've heard other people talk about.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's right.	CHITCHAT
I CS pressure.	CHITCHAT
The pressure levels is super super important.	CHITCHAT
Thank you bro.	CHITCHAT
Yeah if you guys have used any particular tablets and you want to chime in with your experience, that's always welcome.	CHITCHAT
I always appreciate the first hand experience commentary when we have questions like that, so red can recommend Huey on tablets.	CHITCHAT
I've also heard really good things about Huey on.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
Again, it depends on your price range.	CHITCHAT
I think that they might possibly be a little bit more expensive than XP pen, but I've heard only good things so far.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I want to go back to this layer and add in between the foliage and the rock layer in the background.	O
I'd like to add some more bright colors.	O
Love the intuos pro medium.	O
Been using it for a long time now.	O
That's why I always hear about people using the into US.	CHITCHAT
They seem to last a long time.	CHITCHAT
Nice, Julian.	CHITCHAT
Seems like a good deal.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's really amazing.	CHITCHAT
The prices of tablets Luckily has have come down a lot in the past, like over the last five years it's been crazy.	CHITCHAT
So it's.	CHITCHAT
Going in the right direction as far as making it more accessible.	CHITCHAT
I want to keep this.	CHITCHAT
I want to keep the color really really bright, especially right behind the.	O
Right behind the foliage, so I'm going to go to color dynamics and again turn that on so we get these cool color variations back here.	O
Read says it's the same price range than XP pen.	CHITCHAT
I had two one note screen and one of the screen completely in love.	CHITCHAT
Offered the no screen one through a friend.	CHITCHAT
When I received the screen one for my birthday.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's really nice red.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad to hear you had such a good experience.	CHITCHAT
So if you look up here at the top left, you'll see that there's some.	O
Sort of striping kind of effect on the.	O
Mountain back here from the light hitting and getting these kind of detailed columns.	O
Started with a bamboo.	CHITCHAT
Had into us at work.	CHITCHAT
Great surface drawing.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm using a mobile studio which is fantastic but he's like hell sometimes that's what I see.	CHITCHAT
It says in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
The bamboo that was a classic one.	CHITCHAT
I never had a bamboo.	CHITCHAT
I feel a little left out.	CHITCHAT
But I heard that those tablets lasted a long time.	CHITCHAT
OK, so just to explain what I'm doing right now, I'm just kind of going back to my block in of the mountain in the background and adding more detail.	O

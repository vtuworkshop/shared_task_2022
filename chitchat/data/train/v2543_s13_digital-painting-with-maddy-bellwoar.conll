So I'm doing this on another layer.	O
Can turn the layer on and off and see.	O
Hopefully we're going in a good direction.	O
Sometimes I end up saying, oh, I'm going to erase out something that I did.	O
Sometimes you paint for awhile and then you look at the before and after and you're like it didn't really go in the direction I wanted, but.	O
Yes, I like to.	O
Keep the layers, keep the new update that I'm doing on a layer above what already exists there.	O
If I'm happy with that and then you can kind of paint for awhile.	O
Check out your work, see if it's going well, and then finally merge it down.	O
If you do like it, that's kind of what I like to do in these scenarios, so I do like to keep merging fairly quickly and keep things on minimal layers.	O
But I also want to make sure that I like what I've done before I merge it down.	O
Nice I frame.	O
Yeah I have recently tried the iPad for painting for the first time.	CHITCHAT
Well, I say recently but.	CHITCHAT
Time is going by.	CHITCHAT
It was for Christmas that I got one and I was also really impressed.	CHITCHAT
Been happy with it so far.	CHITCHAT
Although most of the painting that I do is still on PC but it's really nice to play around with.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully I can get more familiar.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I will merge these down now.	O
And also I think I'm going to turn off the sketch layer because I think everything that I had planned to do in the sketches now in.	O
So I don't think we need to sketch layer anymore to guide us.	O
I'll leave it there.	O
Just turn the visibility off just in case.	O
I don't throw it away.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's keep going.	O
So make a new layer.	O
And come to the.	O
The mountain here maybe a race out.	O
And I want to bring in some of these details.	O
I'm going to turn off color dynamics now 'cause I need to be more precise.	O
So I don't want my colors to be all over the place.	O
I want to bring in some of these little.	O
Shadows and things.	O
Is there any focus on the work this morning?	CHITCHAT
Just an icepick Waterstones true Sky yeah this so this painting isn't really in any kind of theme.	O
It's not part of our the art club studies or anything like that.	O
I just wanted to paint something nice and relaxing today and this scene is got a lot of my favorite things in it because I love painting Canyon scenes and I also love foliage and there's a little bit of both.	O
In this one so.	O
Just the types I did take a day to relax and paint something pretty.	O
But my focus as far as like what I'm trying to work on in this scene, is mostly.	O
I want to work on brushwork using some interesting brushwork and hopefully capturing the mood of the scene.	O
So I've been trying to work on, you know, painting in a more painterly style.	O
So having my paintings appear more like traditional painting.	O
And the idea that you get across the mood of the scene even if we don't paint it hyper.	O
Realistically, you can still get across the mood in the feeling of being there.	O
Am I too late for this loan or how long we work on it?	CHITCHAT
I want to paint along but it is early here.	CHITCHAT
I'm bleary.	CHITCHAT
I know it's really early for you.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, clever.	CHITCHAT
Let me take a peek at what time it is.	CHITCHAT
So we've been.	CHITCHAT
We've been.	CHITCHAT
Live for.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's been almost an hour.	CHITCHAT
Not quite yet.	CHITCHAT
Actually, it has been an hour.	CHITCHAT
I forgot I've started early earlier.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I will probably work it be working on this for I imagine another hour at least to get all the try to get nice details in and get it to a more finished place.	CHITCHAT
I would imagine another hour and then we might work on another study after, but you're always welcome to continue on this one if you need more than an hour, for example.	CHITCHAT
We might work on another study directly after this one.	CHITCHAT
So there's some little Tufts of grass is, and things coming up in between rocks here in there, so I want to kind of pop in these little green bits.	O

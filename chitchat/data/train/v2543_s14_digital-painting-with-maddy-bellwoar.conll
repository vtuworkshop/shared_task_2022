Going to try this or similar in Frisco.	CHITCHAT
I would love to see that.	CHITCHAT
That's a great idea.	CHITCHAT
And back here in the.	CHITCHAT
As the River curves around the foliage is coming all the way down here to the where the water meets up with the land and it's just all green.	O
Al Green down there.	O
Bring in some of these little.	O
Details so those of you who have been watching this from the beginning or from earlier on, you'll see that the process kind of does slow down.	O
At some point the early stages of this painting go really, really fast, but depending on what you want your.	O
Level of Polish to be.	O
It does take some time, it thinks do kind of slow down.	O
Once you start getting into, you know starting to flesh out details and starting to clean things up, so that's kind of where I am now.	O
Things have slowed down a little bit, but.	O
Yeah, it will pay off.	O
I think we get things looking a little nicer.	O
There's a rock that comes out over here, that's a.	O
Bit of a.	O
Square rectangular shape.	O
I think I will add that in.	O
A little darker overall in the shadows over here.	O
And there's a bit of rim lighting, which I'm a big fan of.	O
I mean, who isn't but a little bit of light hitting the top of this.	O
This rock over here.	O
Little bit of warm light tops that out.	O
I'm here too.	CHITCHAT
Blood or not, that's rim lighting, but give it a little lighting.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
I'm getting close to wanting to merge the foliage layer onto the layer of the mountains and just paint that all is one.	O
Have the freedom to just paint the wherever?	CHITCHAT
So let's just.	CHITCHAT
Erase out a couple more things that I think.	O
That I don't love and then we'll just merge them.	O
OK, so here's our layers.	O
Basically, the background gradients and then everything else.	O
I think it might be nice to paint a little bit in the Sky.	O
I can basically just take any.	O
Any brush and I don't want to ruin the nice gradient we have there, but if I am trying to give this nice traditional kind of feeling, it might be nice to just put some brush strokes in the Sky just as like a stylistic thing, but we don't need to.	O
It doesn't really need to make sense, it just needs to look cool.	O
Sometimes we can have our brush strokes kind of aiming in towards the focal point.	O
Now if you were to use this, indicate cloud something like that you could add some clouds this scene.	O
But you know, sometimes there's these light wispy clouds up in the Sky, so even just some of these light brush strokes can indicate just a little bit of clouds without us needing to really over explain them or get too specific with the clouds and it just keeps things a little interesting, so I'm going to keep the brushstrokes aiming inward towards the focal point.	O
You can lower the Opacity on that if it's too much, but it's fun to experiment with.	O
Alright, I will merge that down so some barely there brush strokes in this guy think is kind of cool.	O
We can always come back to it later since that layer is on its own.	O
It's pretty safe.	O
Take a moment for some tea.	CHITCHAT

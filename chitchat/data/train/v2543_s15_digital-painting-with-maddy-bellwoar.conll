OK.	CHITCHAT
So painting on a layer above the.	O
The rocks and everything.	O
And this is a little bit of trial and error here, but I'm grabbing some brushes that I think can give a little bit of a wispy kind of texture for some of these random grasses and things going on here.	O
And I'm trying to stick to natural looking green, so I'm keeping them pretty desaturated.	O
I'm trying not to go with any like bright bright greens.	O
You know, those like Saint Patrick's Day kind of greens.	O
It took me along time painting foliage to be able to choose more natural looking greens.	O
I always would oversaturate them, and again, that could be a style could be a style that if you're if you paint very cold, very colorful, and that's your thing, something wrong with it, but I was going for a realistic looking.	O
I was struggling to get that, and one of the biggest things that I learned.	O
Was that a lot of times green has more yellow than you think.	O
It's more towards like an olive yellow color than you might think to get some of these.	O
These realistic looking green colors, so that might be happening to you too.	O
If you feel any struggle with your green paintings, try adding a little more yellow.	O
Some nice little.	O
Tufts down here.	O
I think it is important for them to be darker at the bottom.	O
Later at the top.	O
So you can turn the layer on and off.	O
I do find that once I've merged a bunch of layers, I find a lot more.	O
I make a lot more quick progress after that step.	O
Then I find it a lot more freedom to just paint wherever I want to paint over mistakes rather than trying to go back to whatever layer that was on and maybe erase it or whatever you know, just paint over it there.	O
Kings on one layer, nice.	O
Of course, depending on the art style you're going for, that might not work.	O
If you want things to be very clean and you've got like line art and then separate layers, then you don't want to merge it down and they have a pain later when you're trying to separate things.	O
So it depends.	O
One of my favorite things in painting foliage is when you get an effect of a lighter background shining through the trees or plants and you get this a lot with, you know, the nice bright Sky shining through and back.	O
Here we have a situation where the.	O
Light is shining on these mountains, and that's creating the same kind of effect, and so let me choose a brush for this.	O
But basically you can do fun things like leaving color pic from this bright orange and then find a couple places and just paint that back in.	O
In this big blob BLOB BLOB of Green.	O
And it looks like little spaces in between the.	O
Bush is in the trees, you know, at least to me.	O
I think it's working.	O
And that's pretty cool.	O
Hi welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can paint this little dots.	O
Merge it down and then I make a new layer so I do a lot of like merging and then immediately making a new layer.	O
And that's because I like the overall of.	O
Process of having the merged, but I do like to have the ability to paint on that separate layer kind of check my work before merging it down so it's a little bit of for me.	O
It's kinda best of both worlds.	O
That's my workflow.	O
So I'm going to take a darker color and start trying to paint in some.	O
Indication of stones and.	O
Rocks and things over here.	O
There's also pretty.	CHITCHAT

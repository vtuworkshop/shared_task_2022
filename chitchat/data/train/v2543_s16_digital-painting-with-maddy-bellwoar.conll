Dark shadow over here under this rock so.	O
As we get as things get closer and closer to us, then we're going to get more of those real colors.	O
Those local colors and.	O
Also, darker shadows.	O
Overall like everything back here, these mountains.	O
Nothing is going to be really really dark there, so I'm going to be pretty light, but here we're getting into the darker things.	O
I have customized these brushes and they are not available yet because I'm still working on making them, but when they're finished I will.	O
They will be for sale.	O
But there is a free brush pack under the description.	O
You may maybe saw it already, but there is a free brush back that I used for quite a long time and I still love is a good brush pack.	O
That's what I was using up before I started trying to make these so there's a lot of good brushes there.	O
If you need some.	O
Of traditional textures and things, but at the moment the one I'm using right now I'm in the process of testing it, so I'm sorry I can't share it yet.	O
But what I'm doing today and with a lot of these recent streams is I've just been using this brush set so that I can test it and tweak the textures and as soon as it's ready then it will be available.	O
Bye.	CHITCHAT
But I want it to be really good.	CHITCHAT
I don't want any weird glitches or anything, so we're taking our time.	CHITCHAT
Going to switch to a flat brush.	O
Try to get some of these shines in the water.	O
So back here the water does have some.	O
Dark.	O
Areas, and that's part of what makes it look shiny, so.	O
For anybody who needs any tips on painting shiny things, one thing that I noticed is it really helps if you put high contrasts.	O
A lot of what makes things look shiny is high contrast, very bright and very dark areas next to each other.	O
That will make something look shiny and hard edges, so it's kind of tough.	O
But gotta be bold.	O
Gotta go.	O
High contrast.	O
Be brave.	O
Then it will be shiny promise.	O
So there's a lot of pink in the water.	O
I in the reference, that's what I'm seeing and I think it's a lot of reflection of this back here.	O
It's like a.	CHITCHAT
This all this light from the mountain reflecting kind of pink and.	O
Non colors in the water.	O
I think it's pretty.	CHITCHAT
There's some kind of ripple effects, so I'm going to try to paint those in.	O
I'm basically painting.	O
It's hard to see right now, but I'm painting like little angle strokes like this down here.	O
I'm trying to get.	O
These like ripple.	O
Triple shapes.	O
And some will be highlights and some will be rolled darker, darker ripples.	O
I still feel like this area on the left is not quite dark enough, let's.	O
Let's go a little bit darker.	O
In the water.	O
There's a lot of shadow.	O
From all this foliage.	O
And it should be a little bit more dark.	O
Trying to find the right color.	O
But I'm trying to keep my brush strokes going in the direction of the water is flowing.	O
I hope that's going to give it some kind of motion.	O
Anne will flip the canvas.	O
'cause I haven't flipped in awhile maybe?	O
Maybe this helps.	O
Sometimes I flip my canvas o'clock when I'm painting, but I hope it doesn't annoy anyone.	O
To watch.	CHITCHAT
But I find it really helpful if anybody is wondering.	CHITCHAT

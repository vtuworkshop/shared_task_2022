It just kind of gives you a fresh look at what you're doing.	O
Sort of forces your brain to reprocess the image somehow, and like you'll notice little wonky things sometimes.	O
What brushes do you use for your initial blocking?	O
So I am using brushes from a brush pack that I'm creating so they're not available yet, but there's a brush very similar to the one that I used to block this in.	O
If you download the brush pack in the description below.	O
There's brush called rectangle texture, and that's a great brush for blocking things in.	O
It's got a little bit of it's a rectangle brush, which is similar to what I was using an it's got a lot of.	O
Well, it has a nice texture.	O
It's not too strong.	O
But I have hard edges and it's really good for blocking things in, so I would try that one and eventually hopefully soon I'll be able to share the one that I was actually using.	O
But I'm still working on it.	O
Up Great tip getting shiny nice, thanks for him and I really hope it helps.	CHITCHAT
I remember paintings honestly.	CHITCHAT
The first part when I when I started to realize that about shiny textures, I was doing some fan art of.	CHITCHAT
Catwoman and I was painting her outfit, which was very shiny, and I was being there is being very careful.	CHITCHAT
I was being timid with the texture and it was looking very mad.	CHITCHAT
And then eventually after studying a lot of pictures of like latex, I realized that.	O
You really need to go super bold with the darks and lights.	O
And anyway I learned that lesson.	CHITCHAT
It's helped alot in other subjects to other than painting costume Catwoman but yeah I hope it helps.	CHITCHAT
I see us as I find it a bit faster to change the blending mode of the brush rather than than the color really.	O
So you like to turn the brush onto like color, Dodge or something like that instead of.	O
Instead of.	CHITCHAT
Changing the color.	O
I do like using blending modes, but I generally use them to kind of alter and edit what I've done usually later in the painting process.	O
Rather than a lot of times during the painting, but that has changed, I used to use blending modes a lot more often.	O
I think that as I've gotten a little bit more comfortable with choosing my own colors, yeah, I feel like I'm choosing the colors I want more quickly in the painting process.	O
Then before so I'm using normal layer more often, but I really like color Dodge overlay.	O
Multiply all those for helping to alter things that I've done.	O
Yeah, Catwoman has a lot of shine, so true high manual welcome.	O
Thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I want to work on this sort of outcropping or she wants to call it, but this area of land that comes protrudes out into the water.	O
I feel like how I've painted mine right now is just not.	CHITCHAT
It's just not enough.	O
There's too much water and I really like the shapes of these rocks coming out and I'm going to block in a bigger area here.	O
Maybe we'll go back to the initial.	O
Brush that I was using to block things in but we need.	O
Need more land?	O
Come out.	O
There's like a little beach type.	O
All thanks could you?	CHITCHAT
I thought that was you.	CHITCHAT
I thought that was you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for coming over.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Do you ever bake all the layers and use the camera raw filter to tweak the colors and value?	O
Uhm, I have not, but that's an interesting idea.	O
But I have not done that.	CHITCHAT
what I usually do for tweaking that stuff personally is I'll use adjustment layers.	O
So yeah, I'll just use adjustment layers that they at the end or sometimes during the process if I'm stuck on something, I'll use adjustment layers to help figure it out, so that's usually my way of doing it, but there's so many ways to do things there's so many different ways to do things in photo shop, so a lot of it will come down to what you find comfortable in your workflow.	O
There's a lot of ways to answer certain questions.	O
Different ways to do it.	O
Are red shared a study from a reference from pixels, let's see.	O
Ooh, I love this kind of environment.	CHITCHAT
I was actually thinking of painting something like this today.	CHITCHAT
That's beautiful red oops.	CHITCHAT
OK, there goes my whole.	CHITCHAT
All my stuff, sorry about that you guys.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT

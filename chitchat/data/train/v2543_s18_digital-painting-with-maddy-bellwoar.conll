There's a like a shortcut that closed on my windows.	O
Bring everything back now.	O
Anyway, beautiful work read.	CHITCHAT
I hope you guys can see this.	CHITCHAT
I love the lighting and I love all these leaves especially in this area.	O
Let's see if I can bring back the chat there.	CHITCHAT
We go trying hard to do environment stuff while you're doing very well.	CHITCHAT
I love this group of leaves.	CHITCHAT
He ran in this area with the high contrast and the light shining through.	CHITCHAT
Gives a really really pretty 5.	CHITCHAT
Well done.	CHITCHAT
Very well done.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for sharing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm wait the depending on what we have time for today we might do.	O
Do a waterfall scene that's like some of my favourites.	O
Subject matters of paint.	O
I find waterfalls actually pretty difficult to paint, but for some reason I still like painting them.	O
So like such a such a beautiful, lush environment, usually surrounding waterfalls.	O
Alright, so back to our little.	O
Area here.	O
So the before and after.	O
I think it's getting better, but we still gotta keep going.	O
Bring this out further.	O
It's just a little bit more interesting.	O
This coming out into the water and then we get these nice texture texture variety between the.	O
The shiny water reflective and then the very matte surface of this sand.	O
I think that's really nice contrast.	O
And there's some little rocks in the water.	O
I don't know if I will include all of them.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a bit busy.	O
It's easier to read the scene maybe without so many, but a couple of them I think will do the job.	O
So let's try it on another layer, 'cause I'm like happy with what we have so far.	O
Let's try another layer in case I don't like what I do.	O
And I will just paint in some rocks.	O
And also erase out.	O
The bottom if we don't get a flat enough, we need the bottom to be really flexed, basically disappearing below the water so.	O
On their own layer, we're going to add a bunch of rocks here.	O
What I'm doing is making a creating a like a Dome shape and then holding shift and using my eraser to erase out, whoops, wrong.	O
Actually go to the eraser using my eraser to erase out the bottom.	O
So let me do it up here so that it makes sense so you can see it more clearly will do big one.	O
So making like a Dome shaped like this then hold shift.	O
And erase out the bottom.	O
So then we have a nice flat edge down there.	O
That's the fastest way I think to do this.	O
Or you can use the lasso tool to make a selection, but sometimes it racing back into shape is really handy, especially because it's kind of nice if use a textured eraser and in this case.	O
Don't erase out everything but kind of do something like this.	O
That's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
'cause then when you fit that into the water, it just looks like there's a little bit of water coming up over the Rock You know?	O
So I think that's nice rather than a perfectly to make it look like there's a little splash or something by erasing out.	O
So it's really fun to think about how you can use your eraser like this.	O
Sometimes it's hard to paint these creative shapes with the just with the brush, but if you paint the shape and erase out you can come up with something more interesting.	O
We got a bunch of little rocks here and I'm also just considering the shape right now.	O
I'm not even thinking about color because it's on its own layer.	O
It's going to be really easy to change the colors of these with the clipping mask or just lock the transparency in paint on top of it.	O
So for example, you can press this button up here.	O
The checkerboard button.	O
This will lock the layer transparency so that what that means is the only area that I'm going to be able to paint on is the area of already painted on, which is the shape of these rocks so I can choose a lighter color.	O
And then go right on top like this and the color I'm painting it is only going to affect.	O
Within that rock shape, so it's really easy to paint in the lines you know I can just take any color and add a little bit of a highlight, and I don't even have to be precise about it, 'cause it's not going to go out of the lines and you just pop in a little highlight.	O
So that's that.	CHITCHAT
Now these rocks are a little bit bigger than in the reference.	O

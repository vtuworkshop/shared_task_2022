We can decide if we like that.	CHITCHAT
You know we have freedoms in our work.	CHITCHAT
You can have artistic license.	CHITCHAT
We don't have to do everything exactly like the reference.	O
I'm just trying to learn about the.	O
The colors in the mood basically is what I'm trying to take from this reference, but we can make changes to little things.	O
I'd like to get more brave with taking making changes, but I want to find the balance because if I let myself go, if I let me get myself go off too much, then I don't think I'll be learning as much from the reference.	CHITCHAT
I still have a lot to learn and I want to keep learning about colors and shapes of things, and so I think if I go too far off the reference then I'm more referencing my own ideas in my head and less of a study where I'm learning from what you see here in front of us.	CHITCHAT
So trying to find balance.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thanks machiavelli, I'm glad you think so.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy with it so far.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to merge down these rocks.	O
Let's do it.	CHITCHAT
So we're back.	CHITCHAT
I want to get us back to our background layer and then everything else here on top of it.	O
And then we start again with a new layer, keep going.	O
I think it'll be fun to put little splashes in the water, so I haven't zoomed in yet on my reference.	O
I do have it full screen.	O
Oh yeah, that's what I'm missing.	O
Pure ref.	O
OK, be rough is back.	O
So I have my reference full screen next to, well, not quite full screen but larger version next to chat so I can see that, but at some point I might actually zoom in on that so we can see some little more little details and.	O
We need to.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Sathish, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
I'm surprised actually.	CHITCHAT
I thought earlier on I was going to want to come back and do a lot more to the mountain.	O
But I think it's kind of cool the way it looks.	O
Maybe I'll leave it loose like that.	O
We're going to keep painting the stuff closer to us first, 'cause That's a little bit more important to look cleaner stuff a little bit closer to us.	O
And then we'll decide if we want to do more on that mountain back there or not.	O
There's one thing I'm noticing in the reference, and that is a pretty dark line.	O
Like a Ridge of foliage that's a little bit darker.	O
Back here and then later coming towards us.	O
and I have that going on in mind, but I think it could be a little stronger so want to bring this.	O
Dark shadow down here.	O
Especially at the bottom of each of these, Bush is and things it tends to start out in Shadow and then come up and the tops of the Bushes are reaching out into the light a little bit.	O
I'm going to make a selection over here because I want to use it as a stencil for myself.	O
And make a selection of the area that I want to be able to paint with in and then I can just go like this.	O
And have these grass is come up from in between these rocks here and I don't want to have to worry about.	O
The bottom edge being clean.	O
Ryan Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
Hey Ryan, how are you guys?	CHITCHAT
Don't be alarmed, Ryan is kidding.	CHITCHAT
Oh That's.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're doing good.	CHITCHAT
I want to say that before anyone starts yelling at you in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I think the amount looks great, maybe more detailed their River compared to the mountain.	CHITCHAT
I think you're right, the River needs the River needs to really feel crisp, at least in one area at least.	CHITCHAT
Maybe here where it's like the focal area we need more crisp details in the water and then the rest can be slightly looser and we can get away with it I think.	CHITCHAT
But I like that idea.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's do it.	CHITCHAT
Whoops, wrong brush.	O

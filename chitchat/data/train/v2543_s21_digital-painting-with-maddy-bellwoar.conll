So I want to put some little darker shadows in the water ripples.	O
Near the rocks to make it look a little more convincing.	O
Like there.	O
Infecting the environments around them like there's some shadows because of them.	O
April 1st has been canceled this year, right?	CHITCHAT
My heart can't take it.	CHITCHAT
I can't take it.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, yeah, I'm glad your wife stepped in on that one.	CHITCHAT
Brian.	CHITCHAT
Two cruel.	CHITCHAT
Too cruel.	CHITCHAT
Oh Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
After that, they're never going to listen to you going back to school every time they're going to be like.	CHITCHAT
Do we believe it?	CHITCHAT
Can you believe it?	CHITCHAT
Alright, darkening up the shadow on the left.	O
So I think the shadow is really important.	O
This is a shadow, but it's also reflection in the water of all these trees which are in shadow is part of what we get all these dark.	O
Dark colors in the water over here.	O
I like to use a lot of horizontal and vertical strokes to in water to give this shiny and.	O
Reflective look.	O
So even when I'm not really seeing it there in the water, in this scene a ton, I've painted a lot of water scenes where I've seen this happen, so I know that.	O
It kind of works.	O
There's one thing that's one benefit of painting a lot of.	O
Studies is that sometimes you start to learn certain patterns, and even if you're painting a scene where that particular thing isn't happening there you've painted enough similar scenes to say, OK, well, I can still use this technique.	O
I've learned it from other scenes, and I know that it will work here, and it might look cool, you know, so I can paint these kind of vertical.	O
Vertical paint strokes in here and I think it will work.	O
Painting is witchcraft.	CHITCHAT
Hey Pavlos, there does seem like there's some magic involved.	CHITCHAT
Alright, turn that on and off.	O
Make sure we're going in the right direction, and I think overall, yes.	O
Let me flip this too 'cause it might be a little annoying to see that going the opposite direction.	O
I'm going to still bring some of these.	O
Darker Blue Green.	O
Shadows.	O
Kind of indicate these ripples.	O
There's a lot of detail in the water.	O
I'm not going for photo realism.	O
Then I would lose my mind in this one.	CHITCHAT
So we're just trying to get the the overall effect in a hopefully simpler way illustrating it.	O
But there's all these little.	O
Ripples and splashes and things are going to start getting some of these in there.	O
Hey.	CHITCHAT
Hey your friends.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
We're doing good here.	CHITCHAT
Painting one of my favorite types of environments, so I'm happy.	CHITCHAT
When I.	CHITCHAT
Trader	CHITCHAT
Put a little bit of texture in the water here to make it look like these little bubbles and ripples and things.	O

We'll see how that goes.	O
There's a lot of this, like disruption in the water.	O
And that's also pretty because you get that contrast between the areas where there's a lot of like ripples in bubbles and then the area where it's a little bit more glassy and smooth and shiny.	O
So I think that's pretty contrast.	O
Maybe it takes a little more time.	O
It's too much.	O
Do we like it?	CHITCHAT
I don't know yet.	CHITCHAT
I don't know yet.	CHITCHAT
I can't murder down yet I'm not convinced.	CHITCHAT
Add some more highlights, so going back and forth with highlights and shadows.	O
Bring back some of the pink Oh yeah, I can move this back now.	O
Sometimes it's nice to zoom out.	O
Yeah, you can see the difference in what's going on with mine and the reference.	O
So I need to bring some.	O
From the highlights out here.	O
I've sort of.	O
Organize all my highlights in the center.	O
Really, this whole area needs more brightness based on what I'm seeing when I zoom out because a lot more clear to compare mine to the reference.	O
With tablet, are you using of Centriq 13 HD and it's cool, but it feels so slippery like have a lot more control when I'm sketching on paper then of honest antique.	CHITCHAT
So I am using the Wakeham Centriq 22 and I I do know what you're talking about.	CHITCHAT
I'm personally I'm happy with the 22, but I feel like overtime this antique.	CHITCHAT
They have been improving the feeling of the tablet, my.	CHITCHAT
Previous tablet I had the 2424 HD an I felt like that surface was a very very smooth and it took me along time to get used to it.	CHITCHAT
I mean I love the tablet.	CHITCHAT
It was a nice big screen and I'm not complaining but yeah it was a difficult at the beginning because of how slippery it was and I was coming from traditional painting so I was.	CHITCHAT
Definitely not used to that type of difference from paper to the slippery screen, but I think that there are improving overtime because now I have the new 22 and it feels a lot better.	CHITCHAT
It's a lot less slippery and more a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Matt, a little bit more like saten for lack of better explanation, but it's still not quite like paper, but I like the surface on this one.	CHITCHAT
So that might be something that's slowly improving.	CHITCHAT
You might be able to buy some kind of.	CHITCHAT
She, like a protective sheet to put on top.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure I've heard of those for like the iPad.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if there's one person teak or not, but you might be able to buy something that goes on top that adds more texture.	CHITCHAT
But I'm sorry that it's feeling slippery and then not super happy with it and he's a good tablet.	CHITCHAT
The 13 HD is a good tablet, but I.	CHITCHAT
Think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, a lot of the tablets suffer from that a bit.	CHITCHAT
I don't think the technology with any of the tablets is quite to the point where it's like exactly like paper, but it might eventually be there, but it's getting closer.	CHITCHAT
It's getting getting overall getting better as time goes on.	CHITCHAT
So I'm adding little highlights to the foliage back here.	O
Right now we've got a big mass of darker green, but I'm trying to add little.	O
Little circular Tufts and things to show.	O
Light hitting and different branches.	O
Jasper says added a piece of paper on top of into Uspro gives it more grip.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
I mean, especially if you don't.	CHITCHAT
If you're using a tablet that doesn't have a screen, you don't.	CHITCHAT
You can just put a piece of paper and it's not like it's blocking you from seeing anything so.	CHITCHAT

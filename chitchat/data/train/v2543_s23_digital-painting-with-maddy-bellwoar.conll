I imagine that you might use up your nibs a little bit more quickly, but.	CHITCHAT
It might be worth it if the painting is that much more.	CHITCHAT
Comfortable.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That makes sense.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're getting closer to finishing this one.	O
Not quite there yet, but we're getting there.	O
I'm going to make a new layer in between the background and everything else, but the layer an overlay and grab an airbrush.	O
I want to experiment with like warming up the Sky just a little bit, actually maybe overlays in the right color.	O
Be ready, just need to go right in and paint it on normal because it's already really great, but I want a little bit of a warmer Sky.	O
You see the before and after 4 after.	O
That works on the interest on it as well.	O
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
Like a good trick.	CHITCHAT
So here's what I was talking about earlier regarding adjustment layers and things.	O
I'm going to bring my layers pile out here so you can see 'cause I think it was going behind my.	O
Webcam, so when I get to a certain point in the process, especially like basically near the end, I like to use adjustment layers to modify things a little bit and.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Maybe tweak colors a little little bit before I paint the final details on.	O
Thank you Jasper, thanks, appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a new layer and go to image, apply image and just this creates emerged version of everything below.	O
So it's basically the Sky and everything else is together.	O
So I'm going to use the adjustment layer.	O
So I'm going to go to the half circle here and we can go through some of these and take a look at what we can do with them.	O
So let's try levels first levels helps with your values, the darks and lights so you can go through shadows.	O
Midtones and highlights and adjust the different brightnesses.	O
Maybe you find that this can help push the mood more.	O
Thank you, Papa Lowe's.	CHITCHAT
Gaussian hi there.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I end up adding a little bit more contrast in this step.	O
But it's just to play around with and I like to just play around with it and see if there's anything I can do to improve things.	O
I also like to go through color balance.	O
And go through The Shadows, Midtones and highlights, and just kind of play around.	O
This is something that I do almost every time, whether I think the painting needs it or not.	O
Sometimes you can find different ways to make it better.	O
So do we want more of a green cast?	CHITCHAT
What about more weapon genta?	CHITCHAT
I think the magenta is more Moody, but you don't always have to change.	O
You don't have to change anything.	O
Blue and green.	O
I prefer not to change anything there.	O
Let's try midtones.	O
The nice thing is that this is not destructive, it's on a separate.	O
It's an adjustment layer so you can go back and either lower the opacity you can mask out these adjustments, or you can just get rid of them completely.	O
You can tell them down, you don't have to.	O
Be stuck with what you do here.	O
Let's try highlights finally.	O
Like look how different you can make this mood.	O
I don't really like any of that anyway, but sometimes sometimes these can really save you if you're struggling to.	O
You're struggling to.	CHITCHAT
Get a certain mood.	O
Sometimes you can find the answer here with adjustment layers.	O
So after doing a bunch of stuff, I'll turn the layer on and off, so this is before, after, before, after, and see if I like the adjustment, 'cause sometimes I won't.	O
In this case I'm going to lower the opacity of it and just have a little bit of a little bit of a showing through.	O
This is before and after of those two little bit more.	O

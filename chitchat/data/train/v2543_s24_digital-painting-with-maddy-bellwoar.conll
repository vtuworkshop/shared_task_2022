Contrast.	O
And finally, selective color is something that I use a fair amount.	O
It's super super powerful.	O
When I first discovered slipped selective color, it kind of blew my mind so you can select your color here that you want to play with and basically go through these sliders and it's going to only alter the colors in this range like the Reds.	O
So now I can decide, do I want more or less cyan in my reads in the Reds?	O
Tone, so you can really, really change things.	O
And then the magenta is.	O
I mean, look at this difference.	O
And this is without going back and re painting stuff and you can totally change the mood.	O
So I like them or orange.	O
So we're going to add some yellow.	O
And then that you can change the values, darks and lights of this.	O
So that feels good.	CHITCHAT
So if I show the before and after there before after it's been more saturated and you can go through another selective color.	O
Or you can do it all on the one layer.	O
And you don't have to go through all these, but you know sometimes it's fun to do.	O
It had more of a glow.	O
What about the greens?	CHITCHAT
I think playing with things like this can really really spark some creativity, because you maybe there's a color scheme that you wouldn't naturally think of.	O
But through playing with these adjustment layers and things you can come up with something interesting and maybe yeah, maybe it opens you up to a new style even.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's.	CHITCHAT
Look at the before and after.	O
I was kind of going through those really quickly so.	O
Will keep a little bit of the adjustments, but we can.	O
Move this layer up to see the before and after all of the adjustments so this.	O
Yeah, this is before.	O
Hold on, let me do this properly.	O
Play image.	O
Yeah, so this would be like before and after 4 after.	O
It's actually not like a huge.	O
Huge change.	O
I've gone through more extreme changes with these, but it's definitely.	O
Definitely bit warmer.	O
So I'm going to get rid of the adjustment layers.	O
Technically, you might want to keep those if you want the ability to paint in a non destructive manner.	O
I just wanted to show how they worked.	O
I don't really need to have all those layers around.	O
Hi Rick, welcome welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
I'll put this back over here.	O
So there's some other things that I like to do in the finishing steps.	O
I make a new layer and put it on multiply and this isn't in every scene, but I think it'll work in this one.	O
I'm going to choose a warm color, maybe this warm Brown or warm purple would actually be nice.	O
And I'm going to use the airbrush to make sort of a vig net around the outside.	O
Of the scene.	O
Now this is a little bit too heavy, but I just wanted to be able to see what I was doing and show you guys, but I usually go pretty heavy on it and then erase out and lower the Opacity until it's like at a level that I like.	O
So just a little bit like this, you really don't want it to look like you've done anything but it just kind of helps focus the viewers.	O
I more towards the centre or more towards the focal areas rather than the outside so just darkening outside a little bit.	O
And.	O
The opposite would be bringing more light towards the.	O
The focal area so we can put a layer on color Dodge.	O
I'm going to double click.	O
We're going to uncheck transparency shapes layer.	O
If you uncheck this, it changes how color dog behaves just a little bit an I'd like the effect more.	O
It's a little bit more saturated.	O
I think it just effects the colors a little bit.	O
All thank you Rick, thanks.	CHITCHAT
So I want to choose a warm orangey yellow color and.	O
We're going to put a nice Big Airbrush and put this glow behind the.	O
Foliage on everything back there.	O
And Yeah, it's over exposing a little bit.	O

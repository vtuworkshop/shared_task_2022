That's kind of what we get in the actual photo reference to.	O
So before, after, before, after can lower the Opacity.	O
If it's doing a little too much, it's kind of intense.	O
We can also go for like a green.	O
You want.	CHITCHAT
Newer photo shop has a color wheel too.	O
Yeah, that's right, that's right pablos.	CHITCHAT
So I have um Coulouris extension, but if you have Photoshop CC 2019 or later or you know any more recent ones, you can go to window color and there is a color wheel here.	O
So if you prefer it might be showing up as the Hue Cube, but if you go to this menu you can change it to color wheel.	O
This was very nice for people like me that prefer the triangle.	O
I still use color is because I've already paid for it and.	O
It does have some extra features, gamut masks and things like that that are nice, but yeah, if you're looking just for the triangle color wheel, Photoshop has that now and it's I prefer it.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's a personal preference thing.	O
You know, some people still prefer the cube, but I like the color wheel.	O
All right, so if we show the before and after this is before after of the vig net and the.	O
The extra brightness behind the tree so it really changes where your eye focuses for me, I'm a less looking at the water and more looking towards the tree were not finished yet, but it's just interesting how those little changes can affect where your viewer is going to look in the scene, so it's nice to think about.	O
But I want to go back in now and do some more painting.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's look at.	CHITCHAT
I actually have some brushes that I intended to be for the purpose of painting foliage and stuff like that, which I haven't even really used in this painting, and I'm not sure if it's like too late to bring him out, but I've got some that have.	O
Some leave kind of leaf effects and things, and maybe at least in the foreground it could be nice to put in some of that.	O
Some of these individual little.	O
Shapes looking like leaves.	O
Not sure if I like it, but let's do a little bit more.	O
I like to use brushes like this to help with like these silhouettes.	O
If I want the shape of these little individual leaves the pop out here, it's nice to have.	O
Not have to paint every individual one.	O
Fresh looks like this.	O
We also have some leaves coming down from the top right here and I think I will probably.	O
Maybe I'll paint these myself, or maybe we'll just block him in and then paint on top.	O
It kind of works out.	O
Bring a branch down.	O
I like this because it makes it feel like you're really in the scene, doesn't it?	O
Having this little branch come down?	O
What's the story behind this work?	CHITCHAT
Is it for a client or project?	CHITCHAT
It's just a study, there's no.	CHITCHAT
Nothing too interesting storywise behind it.	CHITCHAT
Just a photo study.	CHITCHAT
To show a just showing my process in digital painting.	CHITCHAT
I do a lot of photos.	CHITCHAT
Studies actually do this every Wednesday here, and I go through showing.	CHITCHAT
Showing my process and talking through work workflow.	CHITCHAT
And anybody is welcome to join in.	CHITCHAT
I always share my references.	CHITCHAT
Below that, the stream in the description, you can find the reference image and.	CHITCHAT
We like to paint together to do some studies.	CHITCHAT
So I want to add in with the.	O
With that what I did with the brush here.	O
I'm going to make selections.	O
For individual leaves.	O
Did you do any streams that Adobe live?	CHITCHAT
No, no, I haven't just on my just here on on be hands.	CHITCHAT
On my own channel.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm making a selection for some more more leaves.	O

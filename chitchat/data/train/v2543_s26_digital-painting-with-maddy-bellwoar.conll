I'd like to have some of them overlapping and I like the idea that summer little darker than others.	O
The light shining through.	O
Going to lock the transparency and dark in some of the other leaves so they kind of blend in more.	O
I think we're getting there.	O
Thanks Makaveli, nice the branch brings it back to the focal point.	O
Yeah, the branch.	O
Kind of Swoopes and inward a little bit.	O
Although one thing I need to be careful of is I think the.	O
The branch is a little bit more interesting in the reference because it has this nice little opening.	O
Space in there, so we'll make sure we leave that in.	O
Give some breathing room.	O
Give some negative space.	O
All thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Ryan.	CHITCHAT
I I have to admit that a lot of that came from the color dynamics.	O
Brushes were experimenting with that and going pretty intense with like letting the color dynamics effect work.	O
And then I went back in and like did a little bit of my own thing on top.	O
But I was really amazed how well it worked out with the colour dynamics.	O
I turned off apply per tip and let it just change each brush stroke slightly was really fun.	O
I will probably do it again.	O
So right now we're kind of doing finishing touches and things, adding some last little.	O
Textures.	O
Yes, I am achin.	CHITCHAT
I am from the US English.	CHITCHAT
My first language.	CHITCHAT
I'm living in the Netherlands now and I am learning Dutch but not well enough to stream this dream in it.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think I will always dream in English anyway just because it's.	CHITCHAT
Ability to.	CHITCHAT
For I think I think for more viewers to understand.	CHITCHAT
I know for a lot of you guys, English as a second language, so I really appreciate.	CHITCHAT
Your effort to speak.	CHITCHAT
Speak in English to me so we can hang out together and I'm as I'm learning a second language now.	CHITCHAT
I really can appreciate it more.	CHITCHAT
English is my first language.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put some little.	O
Some more little breaks in the foliage here.	O
Looking through to the Sky, although I think that brush might be a little bit too much.	O
Will find something less intense.	O
The only problem with making I'm making a.	O
A new brush there right now.	O
What other things that I find sometimes is I'm doing trial and error.	O
I have a bunch of brushes that I'm not super familiar with yet, so I'm kind of like sorting through my brushes, trying to find the right one so.	O
Sorry for that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so if anybody was if anybody was painting along, if you'd like to share your painting, you're welcome to post it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
If you need more time to work on it, then no worries, you're welcome to take your time.	CHITCHAT
Stream isn't over yet, and you can share it whenever you're ready.	CHITCHAT
But I might be soon working, moving on to another painting.	CHITCHAT
And leaving this one as finished.	CHITCHAT
We could go on and on and on detailing this, but for me it was just meant to be a.	CHITCHAT
Couple hour photo study and I think, thinking that time that I'm.	CHITCHAT
Pretty ready to call it done.	O

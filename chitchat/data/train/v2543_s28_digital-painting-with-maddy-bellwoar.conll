Hi Cody, welcome.	CHITCHAT
This is a beautiful work by Jackson Joker in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I like the dimension you gave to the foliage is really nice with the lighter green on top.	CHITCHAT
Feels very 3D.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'm glad you painted with us.	CHITCHAT

I really like and I like the style on the top left, top left mountain 2.	CHITCHAT
Glove back on.	CHITCHAT

This is going to be something a little different.	O
With intense lighting, so this is going to be.	O
This is another reference from pixels, actually the other one from today was Unsplash.	O
This is pixels and I will share the link.	O
In chat and I will also post it.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I also post it below in the stream description, so give me one moment.	CHITCHAT
Sorry for the way guys, I just need to update everything for people that want to paint along so you can find the reference.	CHITCHAT

So go out about 4000 by 2500 pixels.	O
Going to save this.	O
Waterfall study.	O
I JS.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I think we're set.	O
If anybody has any questions or if you have any trouble finding the reference images, let me know and we'll make sure we fix it.	CHITCHAT
But I will be talking through my process as we go here, and if you have any questions let me know.	CHITCHAT
Will try to go step by step.	O
So I think I will start with a sketch on this one.	O
I usually I bake.	CHITCHAT
I use a sketch like 8 out of 10 times.	O
I use the sketch most of the time, but sometimes I don't.	O
But I think I will for this one.	O
It really helps me to plan out what I'm doing, so I'm just going to look at what's going on right here on this reference and try to match that as much as possible.	O
And if anything.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to try to simplify some of what's there, so that means you know looking for opportunities to stylize or simplify.	O
If there's a lot of busy stuff going on, trying to pick out the most important thing and just focus on that.	O
So, for example this branch.	O
It's got a lot of little branches and Twigs coming out.	O
But maybe just getting the main branch and picking a couple of the most important ones, that sort of a way to start I think.	O
And then we can add more if needed and get into that kind of details.	O
Yeah, yeah you can.	CHITCHAT
There's a link in the description to my discord server, so you're welcome to join that if you like, and you can post.	CHITCHAT
There are channels in there for sharing your art for sharing work in progress, things like that and.	CHITCHAT
Then if you want to share, if you're painting along with these studies and you want to share, that's a place you can post your image and then take the URL and post it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
You can't post images directly from your PC into the chat, but you can upload them to somewhere like discord or any social media site, and then put the link in chat and that should work fine.	CHITCHAT
So we've got a pretty big like Boulder up here and then these Little Rock, so a way of simplifying.	O
I'm looking at these.	O
These are actually two rocks, but starting with one line.	O
To start breaking that up and then we can kind of divide them up within that.	O
OK, let's see clever joined us for the last one.	CHITCHAT
Is loading slowly for me for some reason there we go alright.	CHITCHAT
Check this out guys.	CHITCHAT
This is from clever.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful colors.	CHITCHAT
I'm a big fan of this warm.	CHITCHAT
Like Would you call this almost almost like burnt Sienna?	CHITCHAT
Kind of color?	CHITCHAT
Nice atmospheric perspective.	CHITCHAT
The lighter mountain in the background.	CHITCHAT
Very pretty clever.	CHITCHAT
I know you did this super fast because you started halfway when I was already halfway done so.	CHITCHAT
Nice work, thank you for joining.	CHITCHAT
It's it's very nice to have company with these studies.	CHITCHAT
Oh cool pablos.	CHITCHAT
I wish I knew how to do that also.	CHITCHAT
Well good luck with your with your fonts.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you're always welcome to join in the future.	CHITCHAT
So now I'm dividing up this these rocks into.	O
But two different ones, but starting out just with that one gesture.	O
And it's nice to be able to move the stuff around.	O
It's part of the reason I like to keep my sketches on multiple layers at the beginning, like if I have one rock and I have a tree in front.	O
I'm going to keep the tree on a separate layer 'cause it can easily move these things around.	O
And then.	O
Merge them at the end.	O
Fresco has a time-lapse, cool, awesome so the one that we just looked at on the artwork from clever in the chat was done in Frisco.	O
You can check out clevers page if you want to see it.	CHITCHAT
Did you also upload the time lapse to your page?	CHITCHAT
I love that it automatically that can automatically save a time lapse like that.	O
It would be awesome if Photoshop has that in the future too.	O
That would be very happy.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm kind of trying to pull out the interesting angles that I'm seeing here.	O

Got this little area, the waterfall pouring out.	O
Coming down like this.	O
Not a proper font.	O
You can't type with.	O
It basically shapes that are letters only to be used for headlines.	O
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
I do I have a Wakeham Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
That's the model.	CHITCHAT
Of my tablet.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to merge these layers so we've got our sketch and I think I gave a little bit of more space.	O
Yeah, let's go.	CHITCHAT
Let's give a little bit.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
Interested to see how you paint the waterfall, thanks.	CHITCHAT
Well I will try to do something good.	CHITCHAT
I like the house splashy, it is, there's a lot of water droplets and it's pretty like it's got a nice like little explosion so this is different than a lot of watercolors that waterfalls that I painted before that have been more at a distance.	CHITCHAT
And you get that big stream.	CHITCHAT
So I think this is cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put my layer on, multiply an lower the opacity that will make it easier to see through my sketch as we're painting below and anywhere between 20 and 30%.	O
Usually opacity, and then I'll lock the layer so I can paint underneath and I don't accidentally paint on this layer because yeah, that happens.	O
It happens to us also if you lock the layer, it's less likely to paint on it, so.	O
Let's let's begin, so I'm going to take a little.	O
Trick I guess from traditional painting and use a an underpainting this color this kind of warm color is very popular to use for under paintings in traditional.	O
That's what I was talking about with this sort of burnt Sienna color.	O
So I'm just going to pretend this is like a bill canvas.	O
Paint the whole background in.	O
This is nice 'cause it gets rid of the white.	O
I don't know about you guys, but I hate painting when there's a white on the canvas.	O
It's hard for me to visualize the lights and darks in the scene, so.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
This will be a good.	O
Start.	O
And then we can actually add a little bit of shading if you want to kind of think through the what the values are going to be like in the scene.	O
It's a lot of rim light at the top and then shadows, so I'm a big fan.	O
I love this kind of lighting.	O
Light shining through the greens so we've got something roughly like this going on.	O
I'm sorry, foster yeah.	CHITCHAT
I hope your Internet fixed to this is not a time when you want to have Internet problems, but I'm glad you were able to at least paint with us despite it.	CHITCHAT
This is our background, so we're going to make a new layer an now start painting on top of this.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's have some fun with brushes.	O
I might try some some different textures and things.	O
I'm going to go with a real bright green appear.	O
Well, that's that's a little too much.	O
That's a little brighter like I wanted a bright green, but let's not put that one.	O
Let's try something like a little bit more natural feeling.	O
So OK, I'm not going to worry about painting over the branch and all that stuff.	O
We're going to paint the branch on top.	O
This is just starting back to front.	O
So I will turn on color dynamics.	O
We really liked this last time it was fun, so I'm going to uncheck apply protip so each brush stroke that I make, it's going to slightly alter the color based on the amount of Hue, saturation and brightness jitter that I chose there, so.	O
Do use a mouse for painting high badanai.	CHITCHAT
Use a tablet, a screen tablet.	CHITCHAT
So my model is the Wakeham Centriq 22, so it's I'm using this stylus to draw on the screen.	CHITCHAT
But there's a lot of different types of tablets out there.	CHITCHAT
If you're looking for information.	CHITCHAT
If you type actually, you know what I'm giving you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm going in autopilot here.	CHITCHAT
Let me let me paste the link in the chat for what I wanted to share.	CHITCHAT
This page.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
That I just posted in the chat that will have a section about tablets and some links to some different blogs with information and things like that.	CHITCHAT

If you're looking to get into it and you need some guidance on what kind of tablet to get, there's a lot of information there.	CHITCHAT
You don't have to jump in and get the same type of tablet I have.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit more of a high end one, but there's a lot of good tablets out there that are in all different price ranges so.	CHITCHAT
You can check that out if you're interested.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we've got a background starting very abstract at the moment, but it's really fun to paint this way.	O
It's very like for me, it's very relaxing.	CHITCHAT

Let's go to a darker color.	O
I'm looking at this color here.	O
It looks almost black, but we're going to go a little bit more like Purples and Browns and Blues.	O
I try to stay away from using pure black in my painting and find other colors that might be suitable and give a stronger mood sense of mood.	O
So we can start with.	O
That and then this rock has a lot of Grays and.	O
Purples and greens.	O
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
You are a all that makes me really happy I am.	CHITCHAT
I'm very excited to finally share it.	CHITCHAT
Trying to speed that process along, but my guess is it's probably going to be another.	CHITCHAT
It might be another few weeks just being totally realistic, but I I hope that.	CHITCHAT
Like around a month from now, it will be.	CHITCHAT
It will be out.	CHITCHAT
That's that's my goal.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to try to make that happen.	CHITCHAT
But there's there's certain there's a couple of effects yet that I haven't created a good brush for, and I want it to be like well rounded, so I'm still working on that.	CHITCHAT
But thank you for saying that.	CHITCHAT
Right, so blocking in this over on the left.	O
If you are struggling at all, picking your colors is OK to color pic from the reference and see what the real color is.	O
Sometimes that can help provide some clarity.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
So if I color pick, this is the actual color of what's going on over there.	O
Thanks, Sarah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
But we don't have to paint everything exactly like the reference.	O
Of course we can put a little bit of our own taste into it.	O
So I tend to like to start with the mid tones and then move on to shadows and highlights.	O
So this scene there's not a ton of Midtones.	O
Comparatively speaking, there's everything is like pretty dark, and then there's pretty bright areas.	O
It's like very high contrast, so it didn't take long to move on to the step of adding these darker areas.	O
There's a really cool glow kind of affect coming up from the water down here.	O
So right now I'm sticking with one brush in the last painting I kind of did the same thing like it went through the early stages of blocking and everything, just with one brush.	O
It's kind of nice to move fast and go through the painting and not worry about changing brushes a million times.	O
And anyway, we're painting pretty large right now.	O
When we get into little specific textures, we might look at nuances of.	O
Brushes more, but right now we're just kind of walking in.	O
So I'm going to put a little bit of.	O
Color on some of these areas that are going to have a.	O
A bright Papa flight come in soon.	O
I'm still going to give them some color now and try to cover up that underpainting and we're going to lighten him up from here.	O
But dark to light is what we're doing.	O

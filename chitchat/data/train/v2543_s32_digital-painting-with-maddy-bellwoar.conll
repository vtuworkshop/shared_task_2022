If it helps, while you guys are doing studies, photo studies and things, I really recommend checking your values as you go, like turning your painting into black-and-white.	O
This is something that I try to do as I go.	O
I didn't do it that much on the last painting.	CHITCHAT
I probably should have done it more, but you can do the same with your reference and with the painting and that really help you see where things are going well and where they can improve.	O
So if you feel like you can't figure something out with your study.	O
Change it into black and white and I can show you a shortcut for that.	O
You do have to set it up so this isn't a default shortcut in Photoshop, but it's super handy, so it's like worth setting it up if you go to view.	O
Proof set up custom.	O
Click that and then under the proof conditions under the device to simulate, you just want to select working Gray gained 20% from the drop from the huge drop down.	O
Yeah, so you select working Gray dot gain 20% and press OK and then anytime that you press CTRL Y it's going to turn into your painting into black-and-white.	O
Once you've done that one time, so then you should be good to go.	O
And the great thing about this is you can actually color pic and paint while you're in this mode.	O
So while you're looking at values only, you can still you can still paint.	O
And you can still color pic from the real.	O
The real colors in your painting and paint this way, and it's super handy.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
If you get stuck, there have been times where this is saved.	O
A painting for me like things really weren't working.	O
I couldn't figure it out and I turned into black and white and I just painted like this for awhile, just not even considering color.	O
Just trying to make the values work.	O
And then turn it back.	O
And suddenly I was in a lot better situation.	O
Oh, thank you, Johnny, thank you for saying that and for hanging out with us.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate the company.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're all doing well.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think I will be brave and merge this stuff down now.	O
You don't have to merge now, but I like to do.	O
It makes me feel like OK, we're moving on to the next step.	O
It's like more definitive so I'm going to merge and then just make a new layer and keep going.	O
So let's work on down here.	O
The water needs a little more love.	O
So it's a little darker, of course around the outside outside here and then in towards where the waterfall is crashing down.	O
There's just nice flash of light.	O
It works out beautifully.	CHITCHAT
It's really, really nice photo.	CHITCHAT
Nor for proof of the news that stream that during my University project.	CHITCHAT
Whoops, I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry to be about influence.	CHITCHAT
But thanks for hanging out with this.	CHITCHAT
OK I am like ansi to start putting highlights in here.	O
I don't know about you guys.	CHITCHAT
I'm I like to go in like an orderly fashion with my workflow, so I'm.	O
Trying to hold off a little bit more, build our way up to those highlights, but I'm like ready.	O
OK, let's just let's just do it.	O
So a new layer.	O
And I might actually finally switched to a different brush.	O
Again, I'm testing out these brushes so bear with me if I have to trial and error a little bit which one I want to use the situation?	O
This one will be good.	O
But I want to pick a nice bright color for the rock up.	O
Here we're going to get.	O
Um, some bright bright light shining right on it.	O
So I brush that has a little bit textures cool because that'll help give the look of texture on the rock.	O
When you're painting.	O
And you want to kind of minimize the amount of work, but get a big affect.	O
You can, instead of texturing everywhere, you can focus your areas of texture in areas of high contrast in your work.	O
So anytime that you've got this really intense.	O
Follow my sketch.	O
You've got these really intense areas of highlight.	O
And shadow next to each other that's creating intense contrast.	O
So let's just look at the reference really quick as I'll show you what I mean over here.	O
This rock all has texture, of course.	O
It's all textured down here, but it's really dark and there's not a lot of contrast.	O

It's kind of hard to see the texture, but the texture is really obvious right here, like you can really get the feeling for the what that rock would feel like if you touched it, and that's because of the way the light is hitting and all these little grooves are getting illuminated in the shadows, and so, yeah.	O
Of the textures, like very, very obvious.	CHITCHAT
So you can like for example in this scene we can put a lot of details in that area and it's going to be nice and interesting.	O
And then the rest of the scene with the areas of the rock.	O
We don't have to like go quite as detailed as this, and your brain kind of fills in the textures elsewhere, which is super nice.	O
Thanks, Norbert, thank you.	CHITCHAT
So it's nice for a quick study, but also depending on your style, 'cause some people are more into more realistic styles and then Kate.	CHITCHAT
In that case they might go.	CHITCHAT
Forward with more texturing anyway, but if you're trying to kind of capture something a little bit more simply, then.	O
But there's something to note.	O
So you get a little bit more of the this Moss on the rock over here.	O
Coming down.	O
Across this area.	O
And I think over here on the left we also have some.	O
And it's very much in shadow back here and maybe even go a little bit more towards blue.	O
Desaturate.	O
It's not in the light, so we're not going to get those really really bright saturated greens.	O
Are using a pad to paint.	CHITCHAT
I am using a screen tablet so it's not one of the pads that's like where your mouse pad would be and then looking up at the monitor.	CHITCHAT
It's like I'm drawing actually right on the screen.	CHITCHAT
That's the style tablet that I have.	CHITCHAT
It's the model.	CHITCHAT
I'll type it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
It's the rock com centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
The one that I have.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
But for anybody looking to get into this, I just want to keep stressing this 'cause.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of different styles of tablet out there, and there's a lot of.	CHITCHAT
A lot of different different price range tablets so.	CHITCHAT
Don't be alarmed if you look up the Sintec 22 because it's a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit more pricey, although realistically I Salat.	CHITCHAT
It's a lot they've come down in price from what they used to be so.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy with my tablet and the quality of it and everything not necessarily complaining.	CHITCHAT
But I'm just saying I don't want anyone to look up that tablet and think that's that's what you need to spend to get into Digital Art.	CHITCHAT
'cause That's not true.	CHITCHAT
Both answers which photos did did you use for drawing when you are a beginner?	CHITCHAT
I mean the images with minimal amount of shadows, textures etc.	CHITCHAT
That's a good question.	CHITCHAT
Well, let me post some information in the chat for you really quick I think.	CHITCHAT
So I think you'll have to kind of use your own decision-making on what is going to be difficult or easy for you, 'cause for each person some subjects might be easier, another you know what I mean, something that might be difficult for me might be easier for you depending on what you like and what your experiences, but you can browse for images.	CHITCHAT
Also give you some websites.	CHITCHAT
Bees websites here.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, Kenny.	CHITCHAT
Pexels, Unsplash, Pixabay and Workfile.	CHITCHAT
They all have free to use images, so you're like safe to make studies of those and post them.	CHITCHAT
You can even make prints of your work from them, and it's free to use images so that I always kind of recommend those, and you can browse through and just try to find something simple without too much crazy detail, you know, and you'll know, I think when you're looking at something, if it if you feel like it's a little too overwhelming, and then maybe look for something more simple, I can show you another website that I also use a ton and I know.	CHITCHAT
Not the only one.	CHITCHAT
I love using map crunch to find things to paint.	CHITCHAT

You have to do it a little bit more of like a treasure hunt on here.	CHITCHAT
So basically this website.	CHITCHAT
Takes images from Google Street View Car and it will give you a random view whenever you click go and so it'll be anywhere in the world and look.	CHITCHAT
I mean I think this is really pretty.	CHITCHAT
Just the beautiful clouds and light Rays and tree shapes and everything.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it's just the side of the road, but you find all these really pretty areas and they're nice to practice.	CHITCHAT
And it's literally endless 'cause it's like.	CHITCHAT
How many places in the world the Google Street View car has been and it's quite a lot.	CHITCHAT
So you can just click go and you get random place.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to find a specific type of environment to paint, you can click the options here and select a certain country like if you're looking for something tropical or snowy or whatever, you can find a place like this.	CHITCHAT
You can also click map and then you can drag and drop.	CHITCHAT
Like this and you'll end up.	CHITCHAT
You know, getting different places based on where you drop a little little person so you can find places this way, and sometimes they're more complicated than others, so again, you just gotta be careful.	CHITCHAT
I'll post the link to this in the chat too.	CHITCHAT
And if you guys are looking for this kind of thing, it's called Virtual Plein air painting, and there's a lot of artists doing this.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, I didn't invent that.	CHITCHAT
I love doing it, but I'll put.	CHITCHAT
I'll type in the chat.	CHITCHAT
It's called Virtual Plein Air Painting.	CHITCHAT
This whole idea of the Google Street View images and studying those.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Sarah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you look on social media for like virtual pleinair tag hashtag, go find so many good artists like I love following that hashtag because it's really fun to see what people post under it.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so that's a recommendation in my discord server we have a channel for Virtual Plein air, so.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of people posting good images that they find in the in that.	CHITCHAT
Channel, so I'm going to post a link to my discord server in the chat.	CHITCHAT
There's also one below in the stream description, so if you are looking for some Anuar having bad luck because sometimes you get a bunch of good scenes when you use map crunch and other times you get like the boring side of the road and it you know there's nothing there.	CHITCHAT
So it depends like there's some days that are hit or miss on if you're going to find anything good, but my communities been like posting in the discord whenever we find a good spot.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to just browse through those rather than searching for hours on map crunch, you can.	CHITCHAT
Find a bunch of that way too, so you can just scroll up through the channel in discord to find them.	CHITCHAT
But I love to paint from those.	CHITCHAT
A lot of what I've done here on behalf has been virtual plane errors painting not all the streams today we're doing or painting right from photos, but I often use the Google Street View Photos.	CHITCHAT
I just didn't find anything this morning I was planning what to paint today and I'm I wasn't feeling it.	CHITCHAT
So I picked some photos that I really liked.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I want some more variety in the greens up here sort of background so it looks like the yellow green is concentrated a little bit more up here at the top.	O
So again, I'm painting pretty abstract for the moment.	O
Things are going to get a little bit more crisp when some of these darker leaves come and hang down in front of this background, then will start making them a little bit more precise leaf shapes, but right now we're just getting a backdrop.	O
And we can go a little bit more gradient.	O
Down into.	O
Like a blue green.	O
So I want to show you something if you have the situation where you're painting mostly on one layer, like for example I don't have these rocks on a separate layer from the background it's altogether, but if you want to paint within the just the background, one thing you can do is just take a lasso tool like this and trace over the area that you want to paint within.	O
And then it's very simple to then take your brush and kind of go like this and you don't have to worry about painting in the lines.	O
I don't have to worry about accidentally going and painting over top of the rock cycle.	O
Paint nice and free like this, almost as if it was on.	O
Did you know separate layer so that's part of the reason that I feel comfortable merging so often is like there's lots of different ways with the tools that you can still work around things even with having the merged.	O
Hello is love a picture?	CHITCHAT
Reminds me of a place that was near my home when I was growing up.	CHITCHAT
We would go swimming there all that sounds beautiful.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
It's good to see you usually paint with one brush or swap around.	O

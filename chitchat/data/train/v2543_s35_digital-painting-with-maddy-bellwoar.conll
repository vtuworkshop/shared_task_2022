I usually swap around quite a bit but not at the very beginning.	O
That's a good question.	CHITCHAT
I usually start off with one brush for awhile when I'm blocking in like the basic shapes and then when I get into more details and different textures then I will use different brushes but usually at the beginning one brush for awhile.	O
It always feels faster when you're just using one brush, but eventually I will start switching switching around.	O
Probably soon.	O
So I want to work on this transition between the purple black dark shadows on the Rock and transitioning up into the Midtones and highlights.	O
I haven't really sorted that one out yet.	O
I feel like there's some kind of color that I'm missing here.	O
Thank you, Sarah.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I really appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I will start with the tree up top now so will make a new layer for that because it is going to be right on top of everything else and I want my little feeling of security that it's.	O
Not painted right on the layer we will merge it down once I feel like I like what I've done but will try it out like this first.	O
Separate layer.	O
So it reshaped going across the top.	O
The nice thing about keeping this on a separate layer is you can use things like the luck.	O
Transparency Hi Eric, I'm doing good thanks.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
I'm enjoying the painting today.	CHITCHAT
I can give a quick peek for you and anyone who is just coming in now.	CHITCHAT
We did one other painting before starting this one and this was the previous one.	CHITCHAT
So if if later anybody wants to go back and watch the video to see this, this was the first one that we did.	CHITCHAT
Now we're doing a watercolor scene.	CHITCHAT
Kind of my favorite thing to paint.	CHITCHAT
Especially with all these grass isn't.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we have this tree on its own layer.	O
I'm going to press the lock transparency tool up here.	O
So that means that anything that I paint is only going to allow me to paint with a metry layer.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Like this watch appearance, how can I get it?	CHITCHAT
Oh, are you talking about the cooler is here so if you look asthma if you look below my description the stream description there's a link to Coulouris and there's also a discount code and that's how you would get the color wheel coulouris color wheel if you do have Photoshop CC 2019 or later, you can go to window color and you will have a similar color wheel.	O
It doesn't have all of the features of colors, but it is.	O
So triangle color wheel format, so if that's what you're looking for, Photoshop CC 2019 and later already has this.	O
So you can just just go from the Hue Cuban search bound to color wheel and you'll find it.	O
Yeah, I like the color wheel to the triangle one.	O
Hey ODI, I hope you're doing well.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much, Eric, I appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
So I want to get this nice green look at look at that green light on the branch.	O
It's like there's so much light shining through all of these leaves that it's creating this green glow.	O
So again, because my layer is locked, I can just paint within that shape of the.	O
The The Tree and it's like I don't even have to worry about painting in the lines.	O
It's super easy.	O
To paint it within the shape.	O
So love it, love to use that with stuff like this.	CHITCHAT
And maybe we could throw a little bit of a bounce light on the bottom.	O
I don't see it strongly in the reference, but it just feels like it should be there.	O
To me I'm going to put a little bit of light.	O
I feel like there's a lot of light bouncing off of this area and to me it just feels like it might be nice for the tree to have a little bit of that light up here.	O
Oh yeah, no problem asthma.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so we're going to go with that and then I will check the lock transparency.	O
So that way I can now paint outside of the lines of that tree and let's.	O
Let's add some branches so we have him.	O
In this sketch there's some branches coming down here.	O

And this one comes all the way down and we can think about like we don't have to paint everything exactly like it is in the reference.	O
If we find that something else might be better for the composition, we can go with that.	O
Like maybe it would look better to have a little broken.	O
To have a little broken piece here.	O
Aiming down and still within this negative space.	O
We can have some others.	O
Coming off too.	O
Some other branches.	O
You can experiment with this.	O
It's a separate layer from the background, so we have a bit of freedom.	O
And there's also branches coming up, so I might make a layer below 'cause it's it easier way to put this branch right behind, so this branch will be coming up like this.	O
And we're going to Add all kinds of leaves too, so the branches are just.	O
I like to do them first because I don't know.	O
It seems logical to me.	O
I can't figure out where the leaves are going to go until I pick it.	O
Put the branches I like to do like the skeleton of the tree 1st and then add onto that.	O
Let's put another little one out here.	O
Another thing I struggle with sometimes when painting natural things is accidentally making them too perfect.	O
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Like matching the shapes of the branches to each other too much.	O
I want to try to force myself to put like some twigs going in the opposite direction.	O
You know sometimes it looks a lot more natural if you don't have everything matching everything perfect, because in nature it doesn't look like that, and sometimes even in you have to change something from the reference.	O
Sometimes even the reference looks too perfect groups would I press.	O
Press to random shortcut key.	O
OK, so we've got these altogether.	O
I think I can turn off my sketch layer now that was the tree was like the last thing that was missing from the sketch.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
Well, we have to still painting the waterfall, but.	O
Other than that, so I think will will do that, so I'm going to go make a new layer underneath of the tree and work on Darkening some of these areas.	O
Right now the tree looks like it's awkwardly floating, but if we put some more shadows here, the trees coming close to these rocks and creating a pretty dark shadow there, and so that's going to feel more like it's going to make more sense to be dark in these areas.	O
Just like the reference were just looking over here, let's see what to do.	O
And same thing over here, there's a lot of leaves that are going to hang down, but I haven't painted in yet.	O
So we can kind of paint in some abstract.	O
Green up here, but the idea is we just want more.	O
Shadows up here.	O
And I think that's OK for now.	O
I'm trying to think what I should maybe I should block in at least block in the waterfall and then work upon the foliage more.	O
Want to keep painting the tree, but I feel like I don't want to let the waterfall go too too long before we add it.	O
I try to remind myself to like work around the scene and not take any one area to a very finished place while the other areas need a lot of work.	O
I think it.	CHITCHAT
I've noticed that I have better results when I work this way.	O
I used to really focus in on one little area and make it super detailed and then go to the next area in the next area and I feel like I've gotten better results with my work when it kind of forced myself out of that pattern and try to move around more evenly.	O
Like spend some time in one area and then leave it move to another area, work on that area.	O
And just keep working around until everything comes to a finished place, like roughly at the same time as much as possible.	O
So we'll add the waterfall.	O
Right now I'm just working on the rock that the the waterfalls cascading over, so I'm going to.	O
Fix up this area 1st and then we'll add the water.	O
Not exactly sure how I'm going to do that either.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Because I've been making a lot of brushes and there might be some but that work well for this.	O
If you look at the reference, you'll see that the water is not really white, but more like a shadowy blue color or something like.	O
This may be a little bit more more blue.	O
Yeah, so we get a color like this and then we'll add little white highlights, but it's very blue and sometimes you have to even color pic to really see like I've painted a lot of waterfalls so I've started to see this pattern, but.	O

It's really a Gray blue, and it's not too bright at all really, and then some of these really, really bright spots appear will be super bright, so we want to save these bright areas for where we want that most affect splash of light.	O
So we gotta keep these pretty dark so that that area can stand out.	O
So that's the plan.	O
But what?	CHITCHAT
But what brush?	CHITCHAT
Hey Matthew are welcome.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing this on a separate layer so I can erase out if I don't like what I do.	O
Have that problem to find it hard not to get too focused on details too early.	O
Ohmygosh that was such a big thing for me and I still have to like consciously work against doing that.	CHITCHAT
But one of the things that helped was staying zoomed out.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if this is something that you already do, but.	CHITCHAT
That's like the biggest thing that helped me was like forcing myself not to zoom in too much.	O
'cause then you like you can't?	CHITCHAT
There's only so many details you can do if you stay at like a full view of your image.	O
So that was like my.	CHITCHAT
My trick through help avoid doing that 'cause I had no self control like I had to find a way to just not allow myself to do it and that was the so just don't seem in there you go well until the end and then you can zoom in.	O
OK so I got this brush with some crazy texture.	O
I'm trying to use to make some splashes.	O
Also erasing back in towards that texture so that can be a nice way to get some interesting effects so painting and then erasing with a different texture brush.	O
So I think that's nice because the splash effect here has like a lot of random little spaces in between the droplets and stuff.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I try not to zoom in too much, but then I still want to do details so subconsciously make my brush really small.	O
You like painting with a one pixel brush like I'm not zoomed in.	O
It doesn't count.	O
Hey, that's alright.	CHITCHAT
I think as long as you're thinking about it and making an effort that's better than than nothing.	CHITCHAT
Just letting yourself go on autopilot.	CHITCHAT
I think that's like just one of the biggest things with art.	CHITCHAT
And with getting better, probably even outside of Art.	CHITCHAT
But like anything that you're trying to improve on is like keeping that that you're staying conscious with what you're doing.	CHITCHAT
Instead of like kind of going into autopilot.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I hope it helps if anybody, if anybody tries that out.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to test out a couple different brushes, 'cause I'm still not happy with how the waterfall is looking and I'm trying to create a brush set that's going to give.	O
It's going to give a wider range of like help with different textures, so I made a brush that was supposed to work for this kind of thing.	O
I guess we can try it out.	O
You got the color wheel also nice.	O
I really hope you enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
I hope.	CHITCHAT
I hope it helps.	CHITCHAT
Makes things a little easier color picking wise.	O
So this brush is.	O
Emulating like a splatter texture.	O
The traditional splatter texture I actually used my watercolors and Gouache paints to make a bunch of splatters.	O
And then I scanned them and that's how I made this a brush so it's really from traditional textures.	O
Trying to make it work here.	O
So far.	O
I think I might start again.	O
With the waterfall.	O
But that's why we do it on this upper layer.	O
Nice on, I'm really glad you like them.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for saying so.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy.	CHITCHAT
So I think this brushes and ice was the word like compliment.	O
I don't think this is going to paint the whole waterfall, but I think if we want to add a little extra splatters onto it this would be nice for that purpose.	O
But I still gotta find.	O
How to paint this?	O
The main shape of it.	O
Yeah, this is nice for a little extra splatter, but it's not doing not going to do it all.	O
OK, so let's get rid of the other layer.	O
And I will turn that one off too.	O
And.	CHITCHAT

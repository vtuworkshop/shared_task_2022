Let's try this one.	O
Thank you for the next comments you guys and thanks for being patient.	CHITCHAT
Will figure out how to how to do this.	CHITCHAT
That's a painting.	O
There's a lot of trial and error so.	O
And tried different eraser.	O
We basically we want to get that effect of the water being more together as it's about to Cascade over the waterfall and then kind of.	O
Falling apart kind of all these little space is coming between there and just kind of tumbling over.	O
I like these kind of like Kris Kross.	CHITCHAT
Affects that I'm seeing.	CHITCHAT
It's because of the water, the water, the properties of water, the water tension, like little droplets, are kind of trying to stick to each other, even as they're falling down.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And we've got water coming over the rock here, and it's very much.	O
And shadow, we get these purple Blues in the area.	O
Back here is going to have a bright light hitting.	O
I think it's going to be nice.	CHITCHAT
Let's start getting some of that color in.	O
It would be satisfying.	CHITCHAT
Funny facts first ever.	CHITCHAT
Photo shop had only one undo.	O
Oh, that's definitely hard mode.	O
Only one control Z.	O
What are so hard to paint it is it is really hard to paint and I love painting it but.	CHITCHAT
I also find it difficult.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I will be painting the bright spot.	O
I tend to douche midtones then.	O
Shadows and highlights.	O
So sometimes the highlights come like as the last step.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We will get there.	O
Do use the dropper.	O
Told the sample colors from reference photos I don't.	O
I also don't have a problem with people doing it or think it's like sometimes people have strong opinion on this and think that you shouldn't do it.	CHITCHAT
I personally don't think it's a problem to do it necessarily, but the reason I don't do it is because I'm trying to practice.	CHITCHAT
Picking my own colors and I want more freedom.	CHITCHAT
Like when I first started doing digital painting, I had to really color pic from the photos because I couldn't choose my own colors.	CHITCHAT
I just they were totally off when I would try to do it an after doing a lot of these studies an.	CHITCHAT
Practicing just looking at the color and trying to select it for myself, I slowly got better with that and I feel a lot more freedom in my painting now like I can choose my own colors.	CHITCHAT
It helps me understand color theory better and it's just been more fun by project.	CHITCHAT
Have a good rest of your day.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I tried to not call her pick from the reference just for my own.	O
Just to get better at choosing the colours myself, and it's definitely been beneficial, is like feel like I can paint a lot faster now.	O
Because of that.	O
And less restricted love digital painting too.	O
Yeah I do.	CHITCHAT
I love digital painting and I also love traditional painting.	CHITCHAT
I get a lot of questions about like which one do I like best and I find it really, really hard to pick because I really like I really like both and I would never want to give up either.	CHITCHAT
And I like doing both 'cause I feel like it kind of.	CHITCHAT
I get inspiration from one and I want to try things in the other.	CHITCHAT
It's part of the reason that my I've been going for this really traditional work in my digital paintings from Thanksgiving traditional painting and then kind of falling in love with that.	CHITCHAT
Wanting those textures here.	O
I'm going to go back to my original brush that I was using to paint this whole scene to begin with.	O
Think that'll help me give me more consistency.	O
And here's a bright.	CHITCHAT
Here's the bright spot.	O
Well, one of the bright spots we were waiting for.	CHITCHAT
That should help.	CHITCHAT
We're going to add a bunch of little shines and things here, so it'll be almost pireway for those.	O

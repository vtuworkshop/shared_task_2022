Is there somewhere we can use your brushes in illustrator?	O
I don't think so unfortunately on, but I I don't use illustrator.	O
I don't have a lot of knowledge about how it works or if you can use the brushes in there, but to my knowledge I don't think you can use Photoshop brushes in illustrator, but maybe.	O
I'm wrong, anybody can correct me, but I don't think you can.	CHITCHAT
All thank you asthma.	CHITCHAT
Well if you have any questions, you're welcome to ask me.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy if I can answer them.	CHITCHAT
I don't know all the answers.	CHITCHAT
As with songs question, I'm sorry, but I know more with photo shop then the other programs I've used illustrator along time ago.	CHITCHAT
But it really was a while ago.	CHITCHAT
And I don't remember a lot.	CHITCHAT
It was very briefly.	CHITCHAT
So right now I'm painting these highlights, hitting the side of the rock over here.	O
Remember lights coming from the back shining through these areas are getting a lot of bright.	O
Pops of light and I'm a big fan of how this how the green is bright green looks when the lights shining on it and love that color.	O
It's very lively.	O
Here too.	O
Little little bit so far.	O
Plants, analogy and all kinds of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Growing here.	CHITCHAT
So we still have that other layer, that splash layer will see if we end up using that.	O
How do you keep the reference photo of you on photo shop?	O
Well, that's a good question, so it's not part of Photoshop.	O
This is a separate.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
App or program and let me get the link to it.	O
It's called pure ref.	O
Is very popular actually for.	O
Organizing reference images and making like mood boards and reference sheets and stuff.	O
All at it below the stream in the description.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's called pure if you can download it for free.	CHITCHAT
I think that they leave it up to you if you want to make a donation or not when you download the program, so you can choose to do that if you want, but I think you can download it for free.	CHITCHAT
Ah, thanks Sarah, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
I try.	CHITCHAT
I tried to organise them like the more brushes you have, the more you need to organize them or else you can never find anything.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Alright, little down over here.	O
Rock as well as the.	O
Green	O
And put some.	O
Put some little noisy texture on this too.	O
Bright greens And appear too can be a little later, I think.	O
So we went from using the same brush for quite a lot of this too.	O
Now I'm like trying every brush trying to figure out what nice little textures we can get in.	O
It's not necessarily super efficient to do this, but when you are trying to get that look at traditional look.	O
Sometimes you gotta mess around with these different textures.	O
Hi Gary.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you're enjoying the stream.	CHITCHAT
I will post a link in chat for you.	CHITCHAT
This is a blog that talks a lot about different tablets in different price ranges and.	CHITCHAT

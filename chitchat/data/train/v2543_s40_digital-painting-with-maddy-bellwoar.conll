Their screen, tablets, and.	CHITCHAT
Regular tablets and all kinds of things.	CHITCHAT
I find it difficult to recommend 1 tablet for anyone because there's so many things regarding your individual budget and stuff that can come into play and how much you think that you would prefer screen tablet versus a regular tablet.	CHITCHAT
But check out that link.	CHITCHAT
Um, if you're looking for a screen tablet, the.	CHITCHAT
The the some of the less expensive ones would be XP pen and Huey and I've heard good things about them.	CHITCHAT
I'm using a welcome which is which I love, but it's a little bit more expensive, so if you're just starting I would say.	CHITCHAT
If you're looking for, if you want the quality of welcome, you could try an intuos or something like that.	CHITCHAT
Those are there types that don't have a screen, but they have great pressure sensitivity.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's just.	CHITCHAT
It's really hard to pick a tablet for someone because there's so many little things to consider, but I hope that that blog helps you make a more informed decision.	CHITCHAT
Jackson says, not sure how to tackle the leaves while keeping the painting kind of loose.	CHITCHAT
You have some plans for that.	CHITCHAT
Not yet, but the previous painting.	CHITCHAT
This area, I think worked out pretty well so.	O
Maybe I'll do a combination of a brush and then some selections.	O
Basically the way the leaves look here, I think I'd be pretty happy with something similar to that on this one.	O
So maybe a brush?	O
To start with and then some individual painted leaves on top to like clean up a couple.	O
Where do you find your reference photos?	CHITCHAT
I will post in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Pexels, unsplash, pixabay, word file.	CHITCHAT
These are the most mostly the ones that I use.	CHITCHAT
Haley arts and good morning.	CHITCHAT
Like you're hearing on tablets.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for Chiming in.	CHITCHAT
Those of you who have different tablets and.	CHITCHAT
Have an opinion one way or the other toys?	CHITCHAT
Nice to share.	CHITCHAT
We've had this conversation a couple of times today and don't feel bad about asking.	CHITCHAT
Important question when you're first getting into stuff.	CHITCHAT
If you look below the stream in the description, there's a link it says resources page or resources that also has a bunch of links to tablet related information beyond just the.	CHITCHAT
The one that I posted in the chat, so there's more stuff there, as well as just general tutorials and things.	CHITCHAT
Hi Gina, I am.	CHITCHAT
I'm using the Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
The welcome Cindy 22 is the tablet that I have.	CHITCHAT
So that is a screen tablet.	CHITCHAT
Alright, maybe we should, uh, paint.	O
Some of those leaves soon.	O
I want to work on the waterfall a little bit more because I feel like I'm still still haven't figured that out yet.	O
Can you show how you draw?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just hang out and watch.	CHITCHAT
That's what I've been doing.	CHITCHAT
If you want to see from the beginning.	CHITCHAT
I started this from a blank white canvas, so after the stream it usually takes a couple hours for the stream to process and then it's available.	CHITCHAT
If you go to my profile and click the videos tab, you can watch any of my past livestreams there and I always start from a blank canvas and show the whole painting process as I create something and I try to explain as I go.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to watch any of those then yeah then you can see.	CHITCHAT
Unless you're asking like to see my tablet like maybe if that's what you're saying when you say show you trying to see the tablet since we're talking about tablets.	CHITCHAT
I don't have an easy way of doing it without disrupting my whole camera setup, so I'm sorry I do have.	CHITCHAT
If you look at my Instagram link below the description.	CHITCHAT
Of the stream, if you Scroll down quite a bit on my Instagram, there is a photo of my setup so you can get an idea of what it looks like.	CHITCHAT
But I don't have an easy way of showing it right now without messing up everything.	CHITCHAT
I need to take a new picture.	CHITCHAT
4.	CHITCHAT
For that purpose soon it's been awhile.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I'll just type it in the chat.	CHITCHAT

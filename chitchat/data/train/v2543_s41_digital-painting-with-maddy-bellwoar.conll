what I have.	CHITCHAT
So if you look it up you know you'll see what it looks like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no worries.	CHITCHAT
This is getting a little little muddy in the waterfall area here, but.	O
We will.	O
Continue anyway.	O
Trying to figure it out.	O
So I think having vertical strokes is important to look like it's falling down.	O
Give the effect of gravity, but then we also want little splash effects coming off.	O
Thank you, Maarten.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
I think this one is maybe going to be my favorite from today actually, just.	O
I can figure out what to do with the waterfall.	O
Then I'll be happy.	O
But hey, that's what we do studies for so we can studies are basically like troubleshooting.	CHITCHAT
There's always going to be something that you can't figure out how to do, and you've got to try a bunch of different methods and then eventually you get it, and then that was the point.	CHITCHAT
That was the point, right?	CHITCHAT
Those appointed doing studies, although it's always nice when everything goes smoothly, but I think you learn the most when you have these kind of moments and you have to.	CHITCHAT
Try things out.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, Shama, that's that's what I'm trying.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to go for that.	CHITCHAT
In the past my style was a little bit more realistic I guess.	CHITCHAT
But I I really love the idea of just capturing the mood of a scene instead of painting it super super realistically.	CHITCHAT
So I've been trying to work on that even though my natural tendencies are to just like copy the reference.	CHITCHAT
But I've been trying to to avoid just copying the reference.	CHITCHAT
Try to put a little bit of my own style into it.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we've got the waterfall tumbling over from the side.	CHITCHAT
How many waterfalls sounds refreshing?	O
It is going to be refreshing, I hope.	O
Try out those splatter brushes when were time.	O
I've got some.	O
Brushes that might work that have little dots, textures and things.	O
We'll see.	O
Got some splatters.	O
Works pretty well.	O
Oh thank you mother ship.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hear that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this splatter brushes nice.	O
The waterfall is really splashing alot like it's very Misty and.	O
Splash explosion, sometimes in waterfalls.	O
The water is like one thick stream, but this one is very splashy, so I want to get that look.	O
That's what the speed sketches are for.	CHITCHAT
Oftentimes a technique is stumbled upon that can create certain texture for another project exactly exactly.	CHITCHAT
It's always a good feeling when you find something like that.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Julie and enjoy the rest of your day.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out with us.	CHITCHAT
Have to get back to work.	CHITCHAT
This is my learning lunch break.	CHITCHAT
Really enjoyed watching and learning from you.	CHITCHAT
Will def watch rest later.	CHITCHAT
Also I'm thanks Sarah.	CHITCHAT
I really appreciate the kind words and the company enjoy the rest of your day.	CHITCHAT
And we'll see you later.	CHITCHAT
For anybody who is knew, I stream every Wednesday at the same time.	CHITCHAT
So also you can find me back here.	CHITCHAT
Be hands next Wednesday as well.	CHITCHAT
Love the energy of the slashes.	CHITCHAT
Yes, yes, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to get that started off.	CHITCHAT
Little bit of struggle, but we're getting there getting there Hiriko, I'm going to flip the canvas.	O
I think it's been too long from one side and this might help.	O
This might refresh our view a little bit.	O
Let's flip it.	O
Hi Bernadette, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I think having a little bit of.	O

Painting the water and then painting the background color back in is helping to make things not so precise and a little bit more chaotic.	O
'cause That's the big thing that's hard to capture about this.	O
This waterfall is like there's a lot of little.	O
It's a little bit chaotic, but you still have gravity pulling it down in.	O
There's some kind of order.	O
Not much of a balance.	O
Ha ha ha.	CHITCHAT
Hey Gary and thanks for coming over welcome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so paint in and then paint over it would be kind of the same idea if you're erasing out.	O
So the idea is creating a shape with the brush and then kind of cutting back into that shape.	O
To change it up a little bit.	O
And these little spaces in between the water.	O
Not quite there yet.	O
There's also these little like they're kind of connected these little.	O
Crisscross openings It's not important effect is having these enclosed little circles.	O
Maggie Valley says I can easily imagine some fantasy adventure characters approaching the waterfall, as if there's something magical about it.	CHITCHAT
Cat Biggs I think.	CHITCHAT
I think the like bright light up here helps 'cause like you get that a lot in games and movies when there's like a magical something magical about that.	CHITCHAT
Whatever it is, it's going to have that nice Mr.	CHITCHAT
Gold glow.	CHITCHAT
The light perfectly hitting it.	CHITCHAT
Get that idea.	CHITCHAT
OK, well I think I actually like that enough to merge it down and say, OK, we're going.	O
We're going somewhere.	O
New layer I want to add this splash down here where the water was hitting the water.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
So we're going to do the same thing and start with a like a blue.	O
Color this is basically what the water looks like in Shadow, and then we're going to add.	O
Some highlights.	O
So we'll add the bright, almost white.	O
Thanks Makaveli.	CHITCHAT
I'm really glad this one so.	CHITCHAT
Turning out well.	CHITCHAT
Another thing that you can do is since we've got this on its own layer right now, we can lock the layer and we can.	O
Paint inside of that with a different brush so we can really.	O
Bring it up with something softer.	O
I think that might be a nice look.	O
Got a little bit darker.	O
Below here.	O
We have some really warm greens in the water here.	O
Oh Pablos, that's so nice of you, really.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it should take only like 10 minutes for you to be allowed to post in there.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Made a quick many design with the font.	CHITCHAT
I mean that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Well I'm excited to see it when it when it allows you to post.	CHITCHAT
Had some great greens, little little splashes of color in here.	O

There's actually a lot of little ripples catching the light.	O
Not sure if there's a way for me to kind of indicate that without painting at all, 'cause it seems like a lot.	O
I want to see.	O
Alright, let's leave the waterfall for a little bit and work on the top, because like I said earlier, I'm going to try not to go too detailed on any part of the scene.	O
While other areas are falling behind and right now, I think the top needs a little bit of love with the all the leaves and stuff on there, so let's work on that.	O
So I'm going to make a new layer underneath of the.	O
The branch and.	O
My idea will see if it's going to work is I have a brush that does.	O
Some leaf textures and things, so I might begin with that.	O
It's a pretty abstract look.	O
So that will work here I think.	O
And we can begin with this kind of.	O
Texture and then paint on top will paint some individual leaves to kind of give it a more crisp look.	O
This will be our starting point.	O
So we want to add some different greens.	O
It's a bunch of different greens in the reference.	O
Blue greens A lot of it is pretty dark because there.	O
The lights coming from behind and then the.	O
Leaves are blocking it.	O
So it's kind of a shadow depending on where the lights hitting this can produce really really bright leaves, but these are mostly mostly creating dark, so the way.	O
And that makes a lot more sense.	CHITCHAT
The lighting on the.	O
The rock up here now that we have these leaves kind of makes sense that they're blocking some of the light and causing this patchy patchy lay situation.	O
The leaves come down over here around.	O
I'll try to be brave.	CHITCHAT
Some of these need to be really, really dark and it feels like a bit extreme, but I think it will make more sense if we do some really dark ones.	O
Feels more.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I just feels more lush, feels more like we're in this enclosed kind of place.	O
Leaves pointing in towards the focal point.	O
So I'm going to merge all the leaf layers until one this.	O
And we can go to image, adjust Hue, saturation again like lighten them or add more saturation or shift the Hue.	O
But I think I'm overall like happy with how it is.	CHITCHAT
And then I will go on top of this layer and now we can make some of our own leaves too, 'cause these leaves in the image, they have a specific look.	O
So what I'm doing is just taking the lasso tool and selecting.	O
Based on the reference how the leaves look, the shape of them.	O
I'm not sure the name of this type of tree.	O
Maybe you guys recognize it, but I've definitely seen these before.	CHITCHAT
And then we can fill it in.	O
So then you get this kind of look.	O
The downside to this is it's very.	O
It can be sort of a digital look, depending on how the shapes that you make, because you get that very, very crisp lasso tool outline.	O
One thing that you can do to help with that is lock the layer and use a textured brush of some kind to paint inside of there so we could choose something with like a canvas E texture or something like that, and then paint in that shape and that can be kind of cool, but I don't know.	O
I don't think it's too bad.	CHITCHAT
I don't think it's too obvious.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Let's just keep painting and see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
There's other ways to paint it into the scene.	O
So we'll get to that.	O
And try them out.	O
But I think I'm basically just going to add a bunch of little leaves like this.	O
Oops, wrong brush.	O
Uncheck the lot of transparency in paint a bunch in like that.	O

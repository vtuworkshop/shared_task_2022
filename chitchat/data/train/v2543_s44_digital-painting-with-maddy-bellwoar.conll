It doesn't take too much, so my idea is one thing you can do to make it feel more painterly is then take another brush.	O
An paint on top.	O
So if you look at the reference some of these leaves actually quite a lot of them have bounce light, like a teal blue bounce light.	O
So if we paint on top like this.	O
We're adding that little bounce light that little highlight on the leaf, and so it kind of makes it look a little bit more hand painted.	O
'cause you're adding a little hand painted element to it.	O
These over here I kind of like those two twigs like not having any leaves on them.	O
I like that being kind of sparse up there.	O
I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
Just put these guys somewhere.	O
Yeah, I like that better.	O
I like this just pointing out.	O
OK, here it is.	O
Fairly basic though, so don't get overrides OK, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Oh you pick my favorite colors by the way.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Super cool yeah.	CHITCHAT
The teal teal blue.	O
Gradients I'm a fan.	O
Maybe you notice that by some of my other like branding stuff I don't know, but nice color choice and thank you.	CHITCHAT
How sweet of you.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add some were shadows over here.	O
I'm just realizing this could be a little darker.	O
So I'm kind of in the stage where now I feel a little bit more like everything is at least present right.	O
The waterfall is there, the trees there.	O
So now I can kind of move around the scene as I want and clean things up, add more details and just have fun painting around and.	O
Polishing I guess we're in the polishing phase now.	O
I think we can definitely use some layer blending modes to bump up the drama.	O
In this one.	O
We can definitely do that.	O
Nice well.	CHITCHAT
It's a great color, great color combo.	O
Blue Antilock Wise.	O
Always been my favorite color but I'm starting to starting also.	O
Really love green as you may be compelled from these kind of paintings that I do.	O
I really love green also, but blue was always my favorite from childhood to now.	O
So at this phase I'm also trying to stay pretty zoomed out because I'm trying to see how everything's working together.	CHITCHAT
We did zoom in a couple times, we zoomed in on the waterfall and we zoomed in on the trees and so was treating some of that stuff on top, but now we are back to zooming out and trying to take in the whole scene here and make sure it makes sense.	CHITCHAT
Altogether.	CHITCHAT
I'm a really big fan of dry brushing in traditional, so I try to.	O
I like to get that kind of look.	O
I'm trying to figure out how to do that in.	CHITCHAT
My digital work too.	CHITCHAT
Let's do a little bit of.	O
Layer layer blending modes and stuff like that, and then we'll.	O
Will keep painting.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a new layer and I think basically what I'm looking for is color.	O
Dodge will put a layer on color Dodge.	O
I'm going to double click that layer an unchecked transparency shapes layer.	O
I do this almost every time that I use color Dodge 'cause I prefer the look when that is unchecked, so we'll go to the airbrush.	O
I almost always use the Airbrush when I do these kind of little effects.	O
So I'm just going to choose a bright warm color.	O

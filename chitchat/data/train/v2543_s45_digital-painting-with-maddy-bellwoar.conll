And just pop that in.	O
And you can see how it's going to overexpose really, really quickly.	O
So we gotta be careful, but just a little bit like this.	O
And here at the waterfall.	O
And put a little bit of light right on those splashes.	O
And anywhere that you want it to feel like the light is really shining strongly.	O
Maybe we can put up more green in the water.	O
So before after, before after, it's really magic.	CHITCHAT
Oh nice, Martin, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, thanks for sharing that.	CHITCHAT
That makes me happy.	CHITCHAT
So I think what I'm going to do now is make a new layer and go to image apply image, so I'm at those phase where I kind of want everything to be merged and start doing finishing touches, but I don't really want to like get rid of everything else I've done below an like merge it all and lose it.	O
So I'm just going to kind of group these and keep them just in case we will make it group so we look like we're organized and then we'll keep painting on top of this layer.	O
So there's my.	O
Little compromise.	O
Color Dodge is really nice, but cannot get out of hand quickly.	O
That is so true.	CHITCHAT
Absolutely yeah, I feel that I have to stop myself from going overboard and sometimes they don't succeed.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I sometimes I go overboard.	CHITCHAT
Do you wanna hi Mattie, do you use a hardcover film to protect your tablet?	CHITCHAT
Thank you lot.	CHITCHAT
You're amazing.	CHITCHAT
Oh thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the nice comments.	CHITCHAT
I do not use any type of film on my tablet, but I think it depends on what kind of tablet you're using.	CHITCHAT
If you want to use something like that.	CHITCHAT
So for the Centriq, it's not really required like the tablet screen can hold up without getting scratches on it.	CHITCHAT
With normal use like the Stylus is not going to scratch it.	CHITCHAT
I haven't scratched it anyway yet.	CHITCHAT
I haven't experienced it getting scratches, so it's pretty sturdy and doesn't have a problem with that, so I don't like to put anything on top of it because I prefer as little parallax as possible.	CHITCHAT
So that means like this the as you put your stylus against the screen.	CHITCHAT
There's that little bit of glass that makes it feel like you're not right on the paper, but there's that little space in between and that's gotten a lot better with the newer models and overtime it's just.	CHITCHAT
Gotten better and better, but there is that little weirdness and I don't like to put any extra layers on there unless I absolutely have to.	CHITCHAT
And so it doesn't really need the extra protection so I don't put it on, but some tablets might have a different a screen that's made out of something different, and maybe it would benefit you to have a protective layer on top.	CHITCHAT
I'm not 100% sure.	CHITCHAT
I've definitely heard people using things like that on their tablets, but.	CHITCHAT
I don't think.	CHITCHAT
For mine that I wouldn't bother with it.	CHITCHAT
So if I turn this later on and off, you can see what I'm adding.	O
I'm just going in with some different colors of green, some more vibrant ones, and just popping in little little pop so late in between in between here.	O
Hungarian.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy you're feeling inspired, but I'm sorry that you're having that experience.	CHITCHAT
All I can tell you is I started doing these virtual Plein Air Studies about like it's at least a year and a half ago now an I made a lot of bad paintings like I promise you, especially at the beginning when I first started doing these because I used to paint primarily paint characters, and I've shown some of the early ones on my Twitch stream before.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of reminiscing.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, you just have to take my word for it.	CHITCHAT
There was a lot of really rough.	CHITCHAT
Change things at the beginning and even now like I have some days where things are just off and it's just not working for me.	CHITCHAT
But overall it's it's yeah it's.	CHITCHAT
It's gotten better, but.	CHITCHAT
My point is, it takes a lot of practice with doing these and they do get it does get better.	CHITCHAT
So if you feel like things aren't working just hang in there and anytime that you do want to go studies it's.	CHITCHAT
It's adding to your visual library is adding to your experience, and as you go there's going to be less failures.	CHITCHAT
An more fun at the beginning if you're trying something new, like if you are doing more landscape painting and you haven't or any little anything really, those it's really hard at first.	CHITCHAT
I'm very lucky that I had my life stream community to hang out and encourage each other and people encourage me to keep going while I was feeling that way, you know?	CHITCHAT

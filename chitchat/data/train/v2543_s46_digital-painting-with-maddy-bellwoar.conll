And I'm very thankful for that because.	CHITCHAT
It's hard, it's hard to push through when you're having.	CHITCHAT
Those days are just feeling like nothing is working.	CHITCHAT
But I promise that anybody that's gotten good at painting landscapes or anything is definitely felt that way.	CHITCHAT
It's like, Super Normal.	CHITCHAT
This is so beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Well then you love the idea of using Google images in Google Maps.	CHITCHAT
Going to try this.	CHITCHAT
Nice thanks Alice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's really really fun and you can if you do share your work, use the hashtag virtual plein air, and then people can.	CHITCHAT
You can see if they're looking for that, take about it.	CHITCHAT
Hi Andy logo.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're doing well.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to add a couple more little branches.	O
I kept the branches really come to a minimum in my painting, but I don't know.	O
I feel like we're missing something.	O
So in the in the reference, there's a.	O
Random little branches coming down like this.	O
I think I'm going to try to add them.	O
Sorry for the background noise by the way.	CHITCHAT
My boyfriend's working from home now like a lot of us.	CHITCHAT
So there's little background noise.	CHITCHAT
Do you have Instagram?	CHITCHAT
I do it should be the link should be in the description below the stream video.	CHITCHAT
And if you can't find it, let me know.	CHITCHAT
I'll post it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you could do movies, TV show stills as well.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I've thought about that so many times and.	CHITCHAT
Rarely done it, but it's a really good idea.	CHITCHAT
What I have done is a bunch of video game Screenshots, which probably isn't as beneficial, but is also fun and fun is important.	CHITCHAT
I'm an architect and do a lot of architectural visualization sketches, but it's hard to switch my style.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Must be cool to design things that actually get get built.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I can imagine that you're used to a pretty precise way of working.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thanks for asking Alex.	CHITCHAT
Just adding little highlight to the branch here.	O
Yeah, I think I like that.	O
I think I like that he had a couple more.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to get carried away.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's nice.	CHITCHAT
Let's try let's try a couple more.	O
It's at least one more, and then we'll add some leaves and then we should be good.	O
It's nice these branches bringing RI back into the scene.	O
There's also branches coming in from the side over here, so we can take a look at that.	O
Do it on its own layer, just in case.	O
Just in case.	CHITCHAT
We don't like it.	O
So here's an example of something that I really like in paintings when it happens so.	O
Having to do with the values, if we turn this into black-and-white, this is this.	O
Green mossy area is lighter than the branch coming out, but the branch comes out into the light at a perfect time.	O
Where the background here is in shadow.	O
Technically, in the reference, this wasn't happening in such a dramatic fashion, but I tried to exaggerate it because I love when this happens and it makes it much easier for the viewer to see what's going on.	O
Because you get that contrast, it's popping either way, so this is a popular thing.	O
In portrait painting, you know to have, like.	O
The background is dark over here and then the person's face is light and then as it shifts, its the opposite on the other side.	O
So you can see what's going on even though we have that shift.	O
So up over here, we want to bring these.	O
Yeah, that's definitely going to help.	O
There's all these mossy.	O
Branches there really green.	O
I don't think I got the right color yet, but this is the idea.	O
They're going to come down from over here.	O
Yeah, that would be nice.	CHITCHAT
What kind of do our own thing?	CHITCHAT

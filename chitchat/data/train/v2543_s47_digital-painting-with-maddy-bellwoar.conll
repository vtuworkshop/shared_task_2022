They don't have to be exactly like the reference, but it's working, so maybe just the stick pretty close to what is there.	CHITCHAT
The colors are so good.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
These colors make me happy.	CHITCHAT
It's like my favorite.	CHITCHAT
The Bright, Bright Green's a little bit of warm light.	CHITCHAT
I love I love these kind of.	CHITCHAT
Scenarios.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I think it's a little weird how these are all stopping right here, so we're going to do the same thing.	O
We're going to have them come out in front here and.	O
Be a little bit darker.	O
So we can see them.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
And maybe another one.	O
Is also going to reach out?	O
Or maybe this one will have another little branch come off of it.	O
Something like that.	O
Maybe it's too small.	O
I can barely see it.	O
We need leaves.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some leaves on this one.	O
Liquor selection Cute little leaves.	O
It looks kind of funny.	CHITCHAT
All thanks, thank you James.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you think so.	CHITCHAT
And look at the upper area with the rocks cleans.	O
It reads better than the reference.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I've been trying to get better at like simplifying the references a little bit, especially ones like this.	O
They're kind of overwhelming with a lot of detail, so I'm glad you like that choice.	O
It's.	CHITCHAT
Something I've been working on and it's like a little hit or miss when I make the right choices with that stuff.	CHITCHAT
I want to get some more of these leaves with a little bit of bounce light shine that blue that adds a lot of depth to foliage I think.	O
Alright, now I'm going to zoom in on the branches over here on the left a little bit because I think they're a little flat.	O
what I have going on here?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to lock the layer, let's color pic from it and choose a little bit of a darker color and give like a tiny bit of a shadow to the branches on the underside.	O
Feel like their little flat with just the one color and their little close to the viewer to have such little detail.	O
So even just a little bit something.	O
And we'll add some more leaves over here.	O
I'm just looking at the reference and there's some little little leaves up and out, and having that shine on there, it's just.	O
Good addition, we got going on.	CHITCHAT
Could you grab the airbrush or any softer brush?	O
Something like this up like this up a little bit.	O
Maybe we'll put that layer underneath the branch.	O
I do want some leaves there, but I don't know if I like that.	O
A lot of trial and error.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's Merge this stuff.	O
And I think we're kind of at the point where we're going to put some finishing finishing touches here.	O
What I tend to do sometimes is after after stream I'll kind of put down a painting for a little bit and then, like a day later, so I'll take another look at it and see if I get any ideas.	CHITCHAT
It's a really nice luxury if you have an artwork you're working on where you don't have to immediately post it or publish it or send it in.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you have deadlines and that's how it is.	CHITCHAT
You have a deadline, but if you don't it's nice to have a couple like a day or.	CHITCHAT
In a couple of days to think about your leave your art alone and then look at it again.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of times you'll come up with some different ideas of things to change or ad.	CHITCHAT

I feel like I've significantly improved paintings in the past by waiting a little bit longer before posting them, and then suddenly like a big mistake is visible to me.	CHITCHAT
Or, you know, just something that could be improved a lot, and when you're looking at something for a long time, sometimes you become blind to those little things, so some other reason it's good to ask for.	CHITCHAT
Second opinion if you have artist, friends and things like that.	CHITCHAT
If any of you guys are looking for.	CHITCHAT
That kind of.	CHITCHAT
Feedback on your work.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to join my discord.	CHITCHAT
There's like a share your art section, and there's a place to share your art.	CHITCHAT
And there's a place to ask for critique.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to share your art without.	CHITCHAT
Asking for critique that still fine, but there's critique section if you want.	CHITCHAT
And anyway, yeah, that can also help get a another look at it for exercise, but for me a lot of times I just like to give myself a little break between posting.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I don't know if you guys have ever had this, but for some reason it seems like the second you post something that's when you notice the thing that's wrong with it.	CHITCHAT
Like instantly after being posted like oh, why did I post it so quick, so yeah.	CHITCHAT
Long story short, I will probably after the stream I will probably take a break from this painting.	CHITCHAT
Maybe come back to it.	CHITCHAT
Tomorrow or so and then see if it's really done, and then that'll be it.	CHITCHAT
Share it.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably post this one here on be hands 'cause I like how it's coming out.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, great depth in your pic.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Robert.	CHITCHAT
I really love these kind of lighting scenarios because there's a lot of opportunity to show depth.	O
I think it's.	O
More so than.	O
Some areas that don't have as dramatic lighting, so I'd look painting dramatic lighting.	O
This.	O
I'm gonna go one more time over it with the splash brush.	O
By the way, if anybody was painting along and you want to share.	CHITCHAT
I will probably be finishing up kind of soon, so if you'd like me to be able to look at and show your artwork on the screen.	CHITCHAT
Think about maybe uploading it soon, no rush if you're not ready, you can always still just post it later in my discord.	CHITCHAT
If you'd like to share it there or during the feature stream.	CHITCHAT
The way to rush through your work, but I just wanted to give a heads up.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we got some little splashes.	O
OK like that, duplicate the layer if we want to make it a little bit more intense, but I don't think so.	O
I think it's fine.	O
Work a little bit more in the waterfall.	O
We're done.	O
I think I should pay more waterfalls like I love these types of scenes, but I found the waterfall, the actual waterfall.	CHITCHAT
You know, the water really difficult to paint, so that means we should probably paint more of these.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I would mind too much, but I need to practice.	CHITCHAT
I paint a lot of waterfalls, scenes or I have painted a lot of waterfall scenes from further away, and that's very different because the the water just kind of becomes one big stream.	CHITCHAT
That's like a lot easier to Stylize.	CHITCHAT
But this one was like.	CHITCHAT
Much more difficult bobbies.	CHITCHAT
Things happening.	CHITCHAT
Thank you auntie pixel.	CHITCHAT
Thanks very much.	CHITCHAT
Painting along rushing again.	CHITCHAT
Oh, clever, don't don't rush too much.	CHITCHAT
You're always welcome to share it later.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to ruin your painting experience here.	CHITCHAT
My take might finish it another day.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we've got so far from Jackson Joker.	CHITCHAT
I love how your water came out.	CHITCHAT
What do you think about it?	CHITCHAT
I hope you like it.	CHITCHAT
Captures a feeling of motion.	CHITCHAT
It really feels like it's moving and flowing down and this area down here.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna think I'm gonna take some hints from what you did.	CHITCHAT
Look at this look at this area.	CHITCHAT
This shift from.	CHITCHAT
Teal green gold warm olivey green.	CHITCHAT
That's really pretty.	CHITCHAT
I think this is working too.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's awesome, beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, I love it.	CHITCHAT

Still not really far with it.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I totally get it.	CHITCHAT
No worries.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, I probably will.	CHITCHAT
I might spend a little bit more time on this too on another day before I finally call it done, but I think I think it's not a good place for now for me.	CHITCHAT
Larious isn't really new with digital painting.	CHITCHAT
It's also encouraging hearing your story.	CHITCHAT
I wish I could remember to know each time you drop a helpful trick all like the lasso thing.	CHITCHAT
Well, thank you if you find it helpful to watch again later.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's too long for something like that, but my video any of my past stream videos are available on my page.	CHITCHAT
If you go to my profile here on the hands and click the videos tab there all there and there's actually something really nice that be hands has the.	CHITCHAT
It's called a tool timeline and it's not visible when I'm live, but if you watch any of my past videos, it's recording as I stream.	CHITCHAT
It's recording the tools that I'm using an like the brushes and colors that I'm picking and everything, and it will show that during the playback.	CHITCHAT
So if you if I'm going too fast for anything then you will be able to see it in the tool timeline.	CHITCHAT
It's super cool, you check it out and all the streams are recorded there.	CHITCHAT
Bottom half I'm happy with top half not so much.	CHITCHAT

I don't know yet.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to like sit on it a little bit will be a little bit, but I'll show you guys what we did today for anybody who came in during the latter part of stream.	CHITCHAT
This was the first painting of the day.	CHITCHAT
Different mood, but still beautiful lighting, right?	CHITCHAT
That's like what inspires me.	CHITCHAT
That's what makes me want to paint something is when I see lighting.	CHITCHAT
Whether it's beautiful daytime scene with dappled lighting, or like sunset or sunrise, these type of lighting situations.	CHITCHAT
Are my favorite thing, so this was the first painting and this is the second one.	CHITCHAT

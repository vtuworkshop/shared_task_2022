I see your moodboards word, word up, Star Wars.	CHITCHAT
Of course.	CHITCHAT
Of course, I like Star Wars, yeah?	CHITCHAT
What's your favorite style of drawing is so into 3D drawing right now, Arbor.	CHITCHAT
So what do you mean?	CHITCHAT
3D drawing, let me let me go look.	CHITCHAT
'cause I'm trying, but I can have another computer where I'm looking at stuff.	CHITCHAT
You gotta you.	CHITCHAT
Photography looks like some photography stuff and one illustration Mr Beard logo.	CHITCHAT

But I like your photography.	CHITCHAT
Very nice, very clean.	CHITCHAT
I like the color.	CHITCHAT
Saturation is intense.	CHITCHAT
But I meant to flat to this stuff.	CHITCHAT
Around 2 training the 3D that I do is a flat 2D drawing that is made to look 3D.	CHITCHAT
An I don't have too much of that.	CHITCHAT
Right now to show because it's most of the time is.	CHITCHAT
Is used in gaming.	CHITCHAT
As you stand out, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
Albert and Chi OK.	CHITCHAT
Be handsome, will talk about that in a second.	CHITCHAT
Most of my 3D looking drawings or end up in a games or movies.	CHITCHAT
And so then, that is really a base drawing for what the animators do, not so much as a.	CHITCHAT
Good clean drawing.	CHITCHAT
And then it takes so long for it to come out that I don't post it on my be hands.	CHITCHAT
Because then.	CHITCHAT
It's going to sit there telling the world about something that I did, that nobody can go look at and see.	CHITCHAT

Brag to the world about your skills.	CHITCHAT
You got to.	CHITCHAT
But once I figured out how.	CHITCHAT
Um, too.	CHITCHAT
How portfolios are supposed to look like when we were supposed to do then it was it.	CHITCHAT
I just jumped on it.	CHITCHAT
So I says thank you for the compliment.	CHITCHAT
Ann Arbor says started working with blender, don't have drawings here just yet.	CHITCHAT
Just some of my fakemon.	CHITCHAT
But that's an IG, OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well there's plenty of 3D.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Illustrators and designers on be hand.	CHITCHAT
So once you start posting you'll you'll have plenty of other people.	CHITCHAT
We're going to check you out.	CHITCHAT
We gotta use be hands as a platform to.	CHITCHAT
Share your work.	CHITCHAT
So that you can get customers.	CHITCHAT
That's my goal.	CHITCHAT
All I want is customers.	CHITCHAT
I mean I'm cool with fans and people who I interact with that's great.	CHITCHAT
But the reason why I have a portfolio is so that I can find customers who pay me to decision draw like this hang out.	CHITCHAT
Of course, the drawings that I make going to be for a purpose, you know 'cause.	CHITCHAT
People not going to just give you money just so you can sit around and draw, I'm just saying.	CHITCHAT
I want the kind of clients that are paying me.	CHITCHAT

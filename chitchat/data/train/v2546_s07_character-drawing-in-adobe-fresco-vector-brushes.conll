I get to draw stuff.	CHITCHAT
And so those.	CHITCHAT
I get to draw what I want.	CHITCHAT
I get to draw the things that they want me to draw.	CHITCHAT
Because they're paying me, but at the same time.	CHITCHAT
The portfolio is when it was going to attract them to me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, somebody got another another language.	CHITCHAT
And last time I had.	CHITCHAT
Um language like this?	CHITCHAT
I had to look it up on Google so.	CHITCHAT
Person give me a minute and I'm going to figure out what you said to me.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully it's something good.	CHITCHAT
Anne Catherine, I have not received a client from be hands.	CHITCHAT
Like somebody who gets in touch with me from being hands or finance man, be hands and then gets in touch with me however.	CHITCHAT
I use be hands as a portfolio and a link that I sent out to people who want to look at my work.	CHITCHAT
And it was, uh, I was having a conversation with somebody I was bragging about.	CHITCHAT
My artwork.	CHITCHAT
This in the early days when I had not done anything to my Behance page.	CHITCHAT
And so this underlying you know there's going to.	CHITCHAT
They have some illustration work they wanted.	CHITCHAT
They were interested in.	CHITCHAT
In talking to me about and then they ask will they have work on Behance and was like Oh no I haven't updated that.	CHITCHAT
And I could see their disappointment, their face and let all man.	CHITCHAT
What am I doing?	CHITCHAT
So so I jumped on in a fixed it, but.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, I have.	CHITCHAT
I do share the link, it is part on my list of portfolio sites where you can find my work.	CHITCHAT
I keep my brand name consistent so that no matter what website you go to.	CHITCHAT
My name is the creative genius and that's really like my title, but I use it as my name and so it is helpful as having a place where people can find me, especially when you go to big Adobe events like I was at Adobe Max a couple years ago and I was drawing live and so people need a way to find you.	CHITCHAT
An easier to say, yeah, find me decorative genius on Behance instead of www.something or Facebook or Instagram.	CHITCHAT
It's a branding thing, so you want to be connected.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to talk to you next Leo.	CHITCHAT
So I never opening tab Adobe application to couple years, hours ago couple hours ago that's hot.	CHITCHAT

Gosh.	CHITCHAT
It's amazing Catherine follow thank you Catherine.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
You ask?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Illustrator, to me is my number one because I'm able to work in vector drawings so that I can scale my artwork.	CHITCHAT
One thing that you're going to find out when you're working and illustrations, and if you're here 'cause you like illustrations.	CHITCHAT
Is is that?	CHITCHAT
Some clients need to be able to scale that artwork.	CHITCHAT
Into a high resolution.	CHITCHAT
Um print.	CHITCHAT
Design.	CHITCHAT
Or even animation a chi you like cartoon and cool cool cool I like it too.	CHITCHAT
And so you need so clients need to be able to stretch out the artwork.	CHITCHAT
An use it in various cases in so by drawing in vector or having a vector file.	CHITCHAT
You're opening yourself up to be that kind of artist that they reach out to.	CHITCHAT
And that's where to me illustrator comes into play, because it can be used for everything and anything, including cartooning.	CHITCHAT
And comics and animation.	CHITCHAT
All types of stuff and I have a comic that I need to work on that I'm gonna do next time I jump on.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
He ran be hands and I'm going to come back on Behance.	CHITCHAT

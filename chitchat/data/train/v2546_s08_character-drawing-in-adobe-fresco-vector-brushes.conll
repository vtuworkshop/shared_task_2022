All right?	CHITCHAT
So I'm just sitting here doodling around.	CHITCHAT
I have an idea what I want.	CHITCHAT
But it's kind of tough to.	CHITCHAT
To just.	CHITCHAT
Figure it out and I think I'm doing going too deep with this mustache.	O
Elect rating 3D CAD models and just downloaded the dimension app olio.	O
That's cool, yes Dimension.	O
Adobe Dimension man.	O
That 3D stuff.	CHITCHAT
You Cook as a man.	CHITCHAT
It intimidates me.	CHITCHAT
I want to draw so many things in 3D.	CHITCHAT
I gotta Oculus Rift, however it's used and so the first person that owned the Oculus Rift already claimed all the freebies to come with the Oculus Rift.	CHITCHAT
And so I had to buy the app straight up if I want to use 'em, which I should have already spent some money on that.	CHITCHAT
And but that's next for me to do like 3D.	CHITCHAT

Maker Faire.	CHITCHAT
And so still there.	CHITCHAT
And they used the.	CHITCHAT
Xbox connect.	CHITCHAT
2.	CHITCHAT
To do a scan.	CHITCHAT
So I got a 3D scan on my body that I opened up in not blender, but some cheap version free version opens or Blender Supper Open.	CHITCHAT
Open source.	CHITCHAT
Think I might have opened it in blender 2.	CHITCHAT
Anyways, I'm impressed by it and I want to do more with it, but it's going to take a lot of time.	CHITCHAT
To figure it out.	CHITCHAT
And I got too many projects to just take a break.	CHITCHAT
To make a break from the project that I'm working on right now.	CHITCHAT
So more power to you.	CHITCHAT

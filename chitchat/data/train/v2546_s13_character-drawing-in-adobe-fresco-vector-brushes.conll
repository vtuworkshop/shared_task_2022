So, Uhm, Catherine, Gotta question.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure well.	CHITCHAT
When I color in like right now, I'm gonna color in this one color.	O
And then I'm going to color that another color, and that another color.	O
Anna is going to know gradients.	O
Just straight up fill colors.	O
So that's how I'm drawn doing this piece.	O
But usually what I like to do is, uh.	O
Put it, put a layer of shade here.	O
A layer of a midtown there and then and then.	O
This will be a highlight and then the other color right there in the middle, so it all depends on the peace and the art style and.	O
My life source.	O
And so, like in this piece, here is there's not going to be any gradients any.	O
Tones well any.	O
Home.	O
It's not going to be as defined as it is in my other drawings.	CHITCHAT
So if you look at My Portfolio, you'll see that.	CHITCHAT
Recently I did a couple of drawings and they have two different type of shading styles and the reason I have to play around till I get what I want is that I'm using vector.	CHITCHAT
And when I'm using vector.	O
Uhm, you don't get.	O
The gradients, that way you would buy like using when you some.	O
Light brushes You don't get the same thing.	O
I don't like that.	O
There it is I don't know if I like that.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, been staying away from touching the same line.	O
So I'm going to keep that going and I'm going to approach this.	O
I need to have solid fills 'cause I'm going to just use the paint bucket.	O
There we go.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Go like that.	O
No.	O
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
Some of them are Mazzone now.	O
Uh-huh	CHITCHAT
Pretty good Hoof Salada lines.	O
Is it frozen on you guys?	CHITCHAT
Is my screen frozen?	CHITCHAT
Let me see what's happening.	CHITCHAT
Is this a textual step Catherine is asking?	O
It's this is the lining step for me 'cause I'm trying something new here and we'll see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure that is going to work out 'cause it's not exactly.	CHITCHAT
The technique that I saw someone use.	CHITCHAT
But it is something that I want to see.	CHITCHAT
What I can do with it?	CHITCHAT
And so this is the step where.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'm adding details as details is the detail.	O
I've already done the drawing, the main drawing.	O
Right, and so if I was to color this and now there will be big solid shapes and then I had to cut those down into gradients or in Frisco, there's no gradients for vectors, so I'd have to cut into different colors and so on.	O
I don't want to do that.	O
I want to.	O
Try something.	O
And.	O
So I'm going to.	O
Keep.	O
These lines as my guides for his time to color.	O
And I probably should hello.	CHITCHAT
I probably should.	CHITCHAT
I should color in some of this before I saw her today.	O
I'm not going to stay here long.	CHITCHAT
Only planning to do the line work.	O
Google Translate says that your name is fking shake.	CHITCHAT
This cool and just language.	CHITCHAT
Yes it does.	CHITCHAT
You know, Catherine?	CHITCHAT
Some of this save the Linework version so that I can put it in another coloring book.	O

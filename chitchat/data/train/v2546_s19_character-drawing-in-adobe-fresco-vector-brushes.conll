I like that line.	O
There we go, just change my size.	O
I'm not concerned with keeping his Super Strats.	O
I just need to close.	O
The shapes some more shapes to close right there.	O
I just do this.	O
And I think I'm going to get really, really close to.	O
Coloring and I will color tonight.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I don't know who all is where.	CHITCHAT
But there supposed to be a way to get the creative cloud for free right now.	CHITCHAT
For two years.	CHITCHAT
And I think it's like has to do with them.	CHITCHAT
With a can of account that you have.	CHITCHAT
Try looking into it.	CHITCHAT
My account is complementary.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
It's already free.	CHITCHAT
I work for it in other ways.	CHITCHAT
But But there's a way to.	CHITCHAT
Get the creative cloud for free in your check into that I think is some.	CHITCHAT
Somehow has to do with trying to cancel the account that you have now.	CHITCHAT
And then then then you end up with.	CHITCHAT
Complementary.	CHITCHAT
Account for two months.	CHITCHAT
Like this?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Any of the new people?	CHITCHAT
Use fresco.	CHITCHAT
Of course you need an iPad.	CHITCHAT
And realizing that as I'm talking.	CHITCHAT
When am I doing it based on the rhythms of the Lions with bigger stroke, I'm doing it freely.	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking of when I'm drawing these lines and thinking of.	O
Where the UM highlights.	O
I should go.	O
An I am just kind of going with the flow.	O
I am.	CHITCHAT
I am.	CHITCHAT
I am gonna make I'm making sure that I touch my hands touch so that their close spaces.	O
And then when it's time to color in, I'm just going to tap inside a little spaces in color automatic.	O
So I'm kinda doing it a little bit on the crazy side.	O
I'm just going at it, but I'm also thinking about when it's time to color.	O
Is this shape gonna help?	CHITCHAT
Bring the highlights and.	O
In the details.	O
And to focus.	O
So here we go.	O
And there's going to be some point where I know I messed up and I didn't do it right.	CHITCHAT
So as an experiment.	CHITCHAT
I've not tried this before.	CHITCHAT
What I have done if you look at My Portfolio on be hands, you'll notice that I.	CHITCHAT
I do use gradients and um and different.	O
Shading techniques, and I'm mostly in Vector.	O
A lot of my work is all back there.	O
Missy.	CHITCHAT
So hopefully that answers your question a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Lose my stream among.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Kind of closing some of these.	CHITCHAT
To make sure that I have.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Now moving kind of fast 'cause I've been at this for awhile.	CHITCHAT
At least an hour and a half now.	CHITCHAT
Watching when I started watching it was only something like 9, so it's a good escalation.	CHITCHAT

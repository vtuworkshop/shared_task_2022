No, it didn't do it this time made me a liar.	CHITCHAT
Here we go and look.	O
I can move the line around and leave a straight line.	O
That's crazy.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I got it.	CHITCHAT
I think that's it is time time to see this experiment come to life.	O
I need to make a copy of this.	O
Duplicate layer and put this one down here.	O
Just leave it down there and turn it off.	O
This one is going to merge down, so that's it's all of us together.	O
There it is.	O
Now, Uhm?	CHITCHAT
Make a copy of that again, duplicate layer and this bottom copy is the one is going to get filled in, so let's turn that one off.	O
We got this one on.	O
Get the colors.	O
Them.	O
You know, are we going to scan?	CHITCHAT
At the fill bucket.	O
Thank you, thank you.	CHITCHAT
So now let's see if this works.	O
Click boom, there it is.	O
About now.	O
Yes, about now.	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
How about now?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
So now just tapping on the screen.	O
With the paint bucket boom.	O
This is why it takes a long time to just do the basics when it comes to the line were because I'm going to use it as a guide for filling in color.	O
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's.	CHITCHAT
And let's some.	CHITCHAT
To go with that there.	O
And let's see if this works.	O
Then Oh yeah, so there's a line that's not connected right here, why?	O
Where is that line?	O
All is right here.	O
And we look at this very tiny area.	O
Dang already go there there there.	O
Let's go here.	O
There it is.	O
Can you get the other color?	O
Paint bucket.	O
Uh-huh Among boom It's working.	O
So let's see if I.	CHITCHAT
It's not like that, yeah?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
So that's one color.	O
I want a super light or thank you, thank you.	O
That's right color and yes, Sir.	O
Hey everybody, thank you Kay Caisa Leo?	CHITCHAT
Dolores yes yes.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yes, This Is It.	O
This Is It.	CHITCHAT
This is the part we were waiting for.	O
So let's use that there.	O
Every girl.	O
Use that there.	O
Let's see how far girls.	O
I was too much, but it's OK.	O
I'm cool with it.	O
I know not all my lines.	O
Are clean.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Thank you, OK, thank you.	CHITCHAT
And dumb.	CHITCHAT
I actually.	CHITCHAT
Want this this right here to be wide so let me find.	O
Where is the line at connected?	O
Why is this?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I know what happened.	CHITCHAT
This was.	CHITCHAT
Let me.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
There are some shapes I don't want.	O
To connect to the same color.	O
Yes, OK, let's go.	O
Let's go with this one here.	O
Stone.	O
And then let's go real white, one super white.	O
Let's go like this.	O
Here it is.	O
So it's very subtle.	O
You can't see it.	O
But as long as it's not white, that's what I want.	O
There it goes.	O
And I can go back to this color and put that there.	O
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate those emojis.	CHITCHAT
So I need a dark color, so let's go back to here, go there, make it a little reddish.	O
And now that's going to be, let's see should go right there.	O
As to Darfur, that one?	CHITCHAT
No, not that one.	O
What's going to happen?	CHITCHAT
Right there.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
So this way you get notice that there's.	O
Parsippany fixing.	O
For it to work properly in, this needs to be connected.	O
There we go.	O

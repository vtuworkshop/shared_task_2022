And so when it comes to my art work, I'm really more interested in establishing relationships so that I can.	CHITCHAT
Get the clients that I need for the work that I do.	CHITCHAT
That's that's really what it comes down to.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And so.	CHITCHAT
But I have been known to sell some artwork that I don't really push it hard.	CHITCHAT
I just have a society six page.	CHITCHAT
And I post to it.	CHITCHAT
When I post new artwork and tell people about it.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
And when his cells and I'm happy.	CHITCHAT
And make a little extra cash.	CHITCHAT
That the color for that.	CHITCHAT
Yep, there it is I make a little extra cash now.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
That's how that's that's my choice.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to be about selling artwork.	CHITCHAT
Because then.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
You know you're very, very dependent on clients.	CHITCHAT
And on my being dependent on some clients for first I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't mind be independent, clients are going to pay me lots of money for the work that I know how to do.	CHITCHAT
I just don't want to be dependent on the kind of clients that are going to be, you know.	CHITCHAT
10 dollar $20.	CHITCHAT
Sales.	CHITCHAT
That's just that's how I go about it.	CHITCHAT
I am.	CHITCHAT
I urge anybody to find a way to earn with their talent.	CHITCHAT
You have to.	CHITCHAT
Find ways to monetize.	CHITCHAT
Your artwork.	CHITCHAT
And the higher quality artwork is.	CHITCHAT
The moral.	CHITCHAT
Higher quality you're going to have a clients.	CHITCHAT
Been trying to figure out how to sell our for awhile.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, that stuff.	CHITCHAT
Gallery's are tough to get into.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Having patrons and supporters.	CHITCHAT
It's tough.	CHITCHAT
Is possible by no less artist get paid to do the Gallery work?	CHITCHAT
Where can you see the final drawing, Bernadette?	CHITCHAT
Uhm, when I'm done with it?	CHITCHAT
Probably tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
And once I'm done with that, I posted on my be hands.	CHITCHAT

Is what it tries to do when it doesn't.	O
When it when my shapes are not closed in it tries to do the whole page so it takes a start to think and it's, uh, I'm afraid it'll crash if I don't.	O
Pay attention to this.	O

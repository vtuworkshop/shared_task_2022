'cause like most people are up to like 1 in the morning, but for Maine nine o'clock late 'cause I'm a dad.	CHITCHAT
And then.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, and then I do this stream happy hour airs all week days.	CHITCHAT
It is one hour stream.	CHITCHAT
That means 60 minutes to make a drawing.	CHITCHAT
I usually try to base it off of whatever the drawings are that I create on the Saturday stream, but this past Saturday I drew something a little bit more complex is like a full character with some tax and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
and I realized this is really hard to achieve in under an hour so.	CHITCHAT
He said we're just a little bit different.	CHITCHAT
I think we're going to draw some hands.	O
I really like drawing hands.	CHITCHAT
I don't draw them enough, and I think that be really fun thing to kind of create and usually do heads and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
So we see my bald head.	O
Usually I create heads and stuff, thought it be super cool to maybe do something a little bit different, but beer of choice tonight is New England Brewing Co or nabco, as some people know it.	CHITCHAT
See hack.	CHITCHAT
It's an IPA.	CHITCHAT
I've had a couple IPS on here on this one is pretty good.	CHITCHAT
I enjoy it.	CHITCHAT
Last IP I say I had a couple.	CHITCHAT
It's only with third show.	CHITCHAT
The last IP I had was highlighted by.	CHITCHAT
What's called.	CHITCHAT
Scar city I think that's an IP.	CHITCHAT
I pretty sure it is.	CHITCHAT
And then I got this guy.	CHITCHAT
Yes, highlight is an IPA.	CHITCHAT

Oh shoot coffee stout or something bye.	CHITCHAT
Narragansett, that was the name of the company.	CHITCHAT
So let me know the chat if you're in there and you want to talk and ask questions.	CHITCHAT
I we're all stuck inside, so I feel like a lot of people are doing a whole lot of drinking right now, so feel like a lot of people are looking for cool things to watch and do.	CHITCHAT
So let's talk about movies.	CHITCHAT
Let's talk about music.	CHITCHAT
Let's talk about TV shows anyone else or watch Tiger King.	CHITCHAT
I'm hooked right now.	CHITCHAT
I got one episode left, so don't spoil it, please.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, why we start drawing here going to grab bar color to go blue?	O
And we are just going to start going to start making and so whenever I make my hands.	O
I'm going to move this guy over here so y'all can see my.	O
Whenever I do hands then we start out Super Simple there always like a like a circle mall kind of object and then there's a square kind of thing going on.	O
That's the start of a hand, so to give you an idea of like the anatomy, this is your hand.	O
This is the circle part, and then this is the rectangle.	O
Hopefully use the Apple pencil to direct better circle and rectangle.	O
Really simple basic geometry shapes.	O
It's kind of like drawing 101.	CHITCHAT
We try to make my curves a little bit bubblier because my drawings really bubbly.	O
That And whenever I do fingers, they're just like kind of these, like not seeing any video really know video are all super weird.	CHITCHAT
Always tell you Matt, because when I'm looking I'm seeing some video playback.	CHITCHAT
As anyone else not seeing video, let me know 'cause that's concerning.	CHITCHAT
Oh wait.	CHITCHAT
Anyone else is not seeing video?	CHITCHAT
Definitely let me know.	CHITCHAT
I'll restart the stream that is concerning 'cause on my side it looks pretty good, but if I can go to watch.	CHITCHAT
I've got some.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I've got some good here to Matt.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what's going on, but you know it would be super cool if you could take a picture and message it to me like a screenshot of your.	CHITCHAT
Browser and could send it because.	CHITCHAT
Ha.	CHITCHAT
That could yeah.	CHITCHAT
Or you know, don't blink a lot, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Set alarm eight.	CHITCHAT
I'll forward it over to the Adobe lashing.	CHITCHAT
Maybe there's something else on the back end, but try also refreshing your browser.	CHITCHAT
As long as somebody seeing me, then I guess I'm not just talking to, well, so let's let's start making some fingers.	CHITCHAT
Where was I alright?	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Fingers are big giant sausage, like kind of weird things.	O
So nice.	O
Alright cool math back they look like that.	O
Usually that was really suggested looking.	O
So what is paired with the bottom part looks like and not just like a weird hippie thing.	O
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Let's draw, a thumb will start with them, so again, always just a big blob.	O
Actually do some reference from this.	O

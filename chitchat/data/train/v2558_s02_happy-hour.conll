Let's take a look over here.	O

Like a.	CHITCHAT
Do you like a rock on kind of thing?	CHITCHAT
That kind of thing, but it'll be a little bit more of like A.	O
Make it.	O
So again, they always just like sausages.	CHITCHAT
And again, this is always like a rough sketch part, so it looks kinda weird.	O
I'm just like a whole lot of lines like to mash.	O
We're just going to put another finger.	O
So I'm looking over Santa Notebook.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to get it away.	CHITCHAT
Pretentious Lee.	CHITCHAT
Exercising.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'd like to be influenced by my own stuff.	CHITCHAT
So how's everybody doing out there?	CHITCHAT
How are we surviving in this?	CHITCHAT
Like, you know, weird world, that we now live in where we don't go outside and everything is online.	CHITCHAT
The irony there.	CHITCHAT
The world is anyway.	CHITCHAT
What are we all watching?	CHITCHAT
Like I said earlier at the beginning of this train, I started watching Tiger King.	CHITCHAT
What episode left?	CHITCHAT
Let me know what you're watching 'cause I need suggestions.	CHITCHAT

Feel like.	CHITCHAT
If you are watching Tiger King, the way to be a.	CHITCHAT
You need like 3 things.	CHITCHAT
You need.	CHITCHAT
A felony is part of it.	CHITCHAT
You have to have.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
Polygamy is also another weird part of that.	CHITCHAT
And then you also need to have a music video.	CHITCHAT
Cats are optional.	CHITCHAT
That part is, you know with all the other stuff is important.	CHITCHAT
That's what I learned from that shell.	CHITCHAT
Right, so we just kind of cleaning up the handle little bit.	O
Not too crazy, it's just a rough sketch.	O
This is the thumb.	O
There.	O
So we kind of see how it starts to take shape.	O
So we got this kind of like rock on sort of thing going for like a crinkled up hand and then the base of the hand is always just literally.	O
Just another big rectangle.	O
So just outta curiosity, anyone watching as anyone new to my streams there any new viewers who's new and who's returning?	CHITCHAT
I see I see my buddy Chris is in the chat.	CHITCHAT
I can actually make him moderate are maybe I'll do that.	CHITCHAT
Chris want to be moderate are I don't know what that entails.	CHITCHAT
I'm assuming moderate the chat.	CHITCHAT
Or something?	CHITCHAT
Alright, I should take some time to tell you guys a little bit about this nepco beer.	CHITCHAT
That's usually the important part of this.	CHITCHAT
Great, let's see.	CHITCHAT
We supposed to drink it.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's good.	CHITCHAT
That's what it says at the top of can.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you guys see that.	CHITCHAT
Our time here in Portland and close family.	CHITCHAT
Personally, three kids.	CHITCHAT
If your head is tough dude alright, I don't know how old your kids are.	CHITCHAT
I kind of feel your pain.	CHITCHAT
I don't have three.	CHITCHAT
I've got one, but she's five months old.	CHITCHAT
I don't think about that.	CHITCHAT
That was bad.	CHITCHAT
She is 5 months old and she she just learned over the weekend.	CHITCHAT
How the screen that's like like not like cry but you know it's really high pitched scream that kids do she like just figured that out.	CHITCHAT
So I hear like regularly just.	CHITCHAT
Wow, that is crazy, so that's been.	CHITCHAT
It's been wild.	CHITCHAT
That's been fun.	CHITCHAT
You know, for my wife and I while trying to work and then.	CHITCHAT
My wife is teacher, so she's trying to like manage 12 other children via webcam while our daughter is figuring out her voice and trying to learn.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe she's trying to sing or something and then.	CHITCHAT
And then there's me down here in the garage trying to like make art and you know, answer to clients and all that kind of good stuff and.	CHITCHAT

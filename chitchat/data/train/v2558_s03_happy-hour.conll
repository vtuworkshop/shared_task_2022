Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, it's pretty.	CHITCHAT
While trying to trying to work from home is interesting.	CHITCHAT
You know, I do have an office job that I go to.	CHITCHAT
Typically when I'm not doing this kind of stuff and I don't have the office right now, but I will say I am enjoying working from home quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I've got a sweet studio that cool pinball machine.	CHITCHAT
I like never buy it.	CHITCHAT
But besides the point.	CHITCHAT
I do enjoy the home life I like it.	CHITCHAT
Does it get spending more time with family?	CHITCHAT
But I can totally.	CHITCHAT
I can totally hear there was paying for people who you know maybe aren't enjoying as much.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Yes, we don't have like a proper space like I took some time to convert our garage and doing my spot so that worked out pretty well.	CHITCHAT
I did hear things import little rough so props to measure for hanging in there.	CHITCHAT
You know, I hope your families healthy, hopefully safe.	CHITCHAT
All that good stuff.	CHITCHAT
Leave pleasure to have you here.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're enjoying it so far.	CHITCHAT
I feel like since you popped in and said you're new to the stream, I've done nothing but talking and not draw.	CHITCHAT
So again, this stream is 60 minutes, so we're really not out is wearing it out.	CHITCHAT
I do take the drawing, so if I don't finish them in time and Polish him up and then they get posted on my bed.	CHITCHAT
They get posted on my Instagram page first.	CHITCHAT
Will make their way into a Behance Gallery and then every Friday at New Year history and it's not really a live stream.	CHITCHAT
It's more of like a prerecorded kind of deal, but I posted.	CHITCHAT
I think it will say Live 'cause I feeds live, but it's a time lapse and I edit it and I put together all the drawings that I made throughout the week into a nice little time lapse and I stream real quick.	CHITCHAT
They take their like under 5 minutes and I pump him through.	CHITCHAT
Into the hands so you all can see the tuning you can catch it as it's happening.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's all good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, quite chatty.	CHITCHAT
I know I like to talk a lot.	CHITCHAT
Is that like you telling me to like shut up?	CHITCHAT
That's totally cool if it is.	CHITCHAT
And, uh.	CHITCHAT
What is the time out live stream?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, timelapses wash.	CHITCHAT
Them all happened really quick.	CHITCHAT
That has no talking, it's just music.	CHITCHAT
Hi.	CHITCHAT
We're going to pick the basic ground.	O
I move my pallet over so I forgot what I said.	O
It's moving up to.	O
And we are gonna try to handle.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
All using the basic round brush, I want to suck that will hire.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
I think this is like 12.	O
And it just kind of following my rough sketch.	O
Detail stuff like that gets added and obviously later.	O
Here.	O
So one thing I like to do alot again using Adobe fresco on an iPad.	O
The 6th Gen 9.7 inch.	O
Usually work on multiple layers, so I can kind of just erase and get those really clean lines.	O
No, like, no like keep being chatty or like no stop talking.	CHITCHAT
I think you meant like no keep talking.	CHITCHAT
I hope you enjoy my banter.	CHITCHAT
Chattaway teacher to work from home.	CHITCHAT
How do you turn the pencil into an eraser without going to the icon?	O
Awesome question.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I want to hear more about how you teach 'cause I was thinking the same regardless.	CHITCHAT
1st, I'll teach you.	CHITCHAT
Here's what I do.	CHITCHAT
Got your pencil right.	O
You got your brush picked so I'm using the basic round vector brush.	O
You draw your line and you're like I don't want that line there.	O
I want to erase but you don't want to go back over.	O
Tap this icon wherever you know it's really annoying.	O
What you can do is see this little toggle switch right here that I'm kind of moving around.	O
The screen that takes whatever.	O
That takes whatever you're using, like whatever tool and converts it into an eraser so you can use that brush to erase it.	O
Oh, wait loops.	CHITCHAT
Well, let me have the get the brush like this.	O
All the eraser selected.	O
Takes whatever you're using and turns into a racer.	O
Now it's really nice about this.	O
Is that it also read the pressure sensitivity so you get an eraser with pressure sensitivity.	O
So like if I were to go in here, start real thin, add a little more pressure, create a thicker eraser.	O
I really like it.	CHITCHAT
So the way that I use this, I usually use it as an array as like a main eraser.	O
You know, like and I keep my racer set to something really big.	O
120 right now so that I have like a large eraser so I don't have to apply a lot of pressure on the screen, so I just have an eraser option to click if I need something bigger or I can use the brush with the pressure sensitivity.	O

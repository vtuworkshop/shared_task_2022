Another really cool tip if you want to get rid of this whole thing really fast, grab the paint bucket, get that little toggle you all the moving around like I do.	O
I just been doing that so I'll see what I'm doing at the little toggle and then you literally just tap on the line.	O
Boom goes away.	O
I'm seeing a Mickey Zombie hand.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's definitely a Mickey Zombie and my hands are definitely like the old like Disney hands minus the glove, you know, but I really like him.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why drawn that way.	CHITCHAT
I think it's just because I feel like they have a lot of expression behind them.	CHITCHAT
And they're relatively simple.	CHITCHAT
To do and kind of quick.	CHITCHAT
So we were kind of what kind of teacher are you?	CHITCHAT
Do you teach like elementary school?	CHITCHAT
Are you like a college professor?	CHITCHAT
And how you handle in the whole stay at home thing.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty crazy for teachers right now.	CHITCHAT
I feel so props to you, by the way, 'cause I can only imagine like if you're handing out assignments and working with students, I feel like no one's reading anything right now.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if I'm right.	CHITCHAT
Good.	CHITCHAT
Miss Sloane, you're passing my line work and sometimes it gets in the way a little bit like this weird pinky that I doodled.	CHITCHAT
Looks awful so we're going to do that.	CHITCHAT
I was saying this actually in my stream Saturday night.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why, but I really struggle with babies.	CHITCHAT
They always end up looking like thumbs to Maine or like just another odd finger that was a little bit better than ever.	CHITCHAT
Just they never quite look like.	CHITCHAT
Oh, professor.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to the welcome to the chat Pasco replace Adobe draw so you can still use Adobe draw.	CHITCHAT
I think you can at least Adobe draw for me with one of my favorite apps for the longest time until fresco came along.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's actually replace it.	CHITCHAT
I think you can still use draw it still a viable.	O
That's out there, but I do know that anything you make and draw or in Photoshop sketch now through creative cloud gets ported into fresco.	O
I have a feeling that maybe Adobe is going to phase those out overtime 'cause they basically taken 2 apps and put them in one.	O
Don't quote me on that.	CHITCHAT
I I'm speculating, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's what happens.	CHITCHAT
Fresco to Maine really isn't lacking anything that the other ones have.	O
The only thing it does lack for sure.	O
Is a shape tool so they added this ruler in here so you can make nice lines but they still are lacking the like circles and those kind of like abstract shapes that were in draw and I think also in sketch.	O
They just don't have him here.	O
I don't know why that is.	CHITCHAT
I really hope that they bring them in together.	CHITCHAT
Who are right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah that you know what pro creates a cool app.	CHITCHAT
It's got a lot of functionality.	CHITCHAT
People ask me regularly.	CHITCHAT
Why do I prefer fresco over procreate and the reasons reasons really simple.	O
Actually, I really like the flexibility of fresco because to my knowledge I haven't opened propane along time, so this may have changed by now.	O
So correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think procreate supports vector lines still.	O
and I like vectors.	CHITCHAT
Fresco does, so I like being able to have.	O
The use of vectors and I like being able to sync everything with creative cloud and pump it into like illustrator or Photoshop or after effects to animate.	O
What about vectors?	CHITCHAT
Yes, so I'm using a vector brush right now.	O
Like if I grab this hand.	O
Right, and I like scale up like this.	O
Is this is a vector through and through we can scale forever.	O
That's so the three brushes in fresco.	O
Can you open pixel brush?	O
Which is what I use for my pencil in my rough sketches and it's just like a basic pencil I used to do that for my rough sketches 'cause it feels more natural and that's just your standard pencil, but there's a ton of other fun little options in here.	O
You can import brushes to get import Kyle brushes, that kind of stuff like like like different markers.	O
And things of that nature.	O
So the pixel brushes are really nice there, just like Photoshop.	O
Brushes matter.	O
Fact they are Photoshop brushes and you can insert all sorts of fun stuff like I have this fun halftone one.	O
You know that I found stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Then the other brush is called a live brush.	O

So what alive brush does is an act like I only have watercolor oil.	O
I think you can maybe add some where they're going to add new ones.	O
There's a whole bunch of options, but they act like real brushes.	O
So like you have your oil there, you know.	O
But they do interact with each other.	O
So like the watercolor is probably the best one.	O
Like if I were to go along and then it bleeds out and it also bleeds with whatever images are underneath it on the pixel layer, which is really cool.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
You know it's a fun way.	CHITCHAT
I see a lot of cool artists make some really nice things using using the watercolor brushes here in Frisco, so there's a lot of fun stuff you can do with that.	O
And then there's the vector brush, which is my favorite.	O
So one of the things I should know about this, by the way, if you're on a pixel layer, so if you look over that way that way.	O
That way you look over that way.	O
Sorry, my camera reverse if you look over that way, you'll notice that all my layers might be able to see some layers like this layer here has like a big solid circle.	O
Other layers have, like this little kind of pixelated circle that indicates whether it's a vector or a.	O
Or a pixel.	O
So something that's really cool if you're on a pixel and you have your vector brush and you start to draw, it will try not to do it right now because I have vector layers, so it's trying to tell me like hey, you gotta pull on these machines like enforce it.	O
Now it's just gonna be mad into the vector lyrics already having if you don't have a vector layer made yet.	O
I don't want to blow away the work I've already done, but if you don't have a vector layer made yet on the pencil layer and you try to draw with the vector brush will create a new layer and then indicate it so that you know you don't have to less work for you have to keep making new layers.	O
Let's see, I'm using computer draw and can do my cards and sketches from my web design.	CHITCHAT
Now I see what you're saying, OK?	CHITCHAT
Fresco might not be the best app for what you're trying to do, however I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
How do you say your name Luke?	CHITCHAT
Is that it?	CHITCHAT
Let me know if I said that right?	CHITCHAT
If not, maybe type in how you fanatically say it.	CHITCHAT
You also got a really last name.	CHITCHAT
But At Max last year, Adobe previewed illustrator for the iPad and it looked like it was tailored towards making like logos and that kind of stuff.	O
So maybe just gotta wait.	CHITCHAT
Usually they announced that kind of stuff in the fault at Max and then it comes out the next year year later at the following Max.	CHITCHAT
So just keep your head in the ground then.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure it's comment, you know.	CHITCHAT
It seems like adobes pushing real hard to get everybody gone and working on iPads, hence why they were these photo shop which was OK.	CHITCHAT
I think people hate it on in a lot worse than it really was.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're going like Mickey Zombie hand like we're talking about.	CHITCHAT
We're going to add some like fun, like tattered, torn off areas, I guess.	O
And I feel like this should be like a little hand wrinkle over here somewhere.	O
Or At.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Another question for the group.	CHITCHAT
For those of you stuck at home.	CHITCHAT
Anyone played any good video games?	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Like Games a lot, I kind of slowed down on playing him 'cause I'm going to adult and I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's not really good reason I have responsibility, but now that I found more time at home, I've been playing a lot more, which is been really nice 'cause I've been able to play a lot with my friends and I think we all were really busy with life prior to this whole virus thing.	CHITCHAT
And now we can all hang out more and catching up and I'm really enjoying it a lot.	CHITCHAT
So I'm always looking for new games, the ones that I'm currently playing I'm playing Call of Duty war zone and I'm playing freedom finger.	CHITCHAT
Yes freedom finger, awesome game, check it out and made by a couple of cool artists is a good Music in South rocks in it?	CHITCHAT
That kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
And let me know what your plan.	CHITCHAT
If you play games.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're drawn in the hand part like the bottom part now.	O
I'm going to put some more tattered up nasty's down there, but I think it would make it like a background kind of either.	O
Maybe their maternal my pressure sensitivity and my velocity dynamics?	O
Let's see if I can close this up.	O

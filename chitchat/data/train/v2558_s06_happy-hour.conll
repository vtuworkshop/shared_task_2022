Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Power of adding a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
Talk about this actually quite a bit of ice trays.	CHITCHAT
I feel like with illustration work for a lot of times.	CHITCHAT
I think with illustration work a lot of time, especially for people who are starting out there.	CHITCHAT
We feel like they need to add a lot of detail to make something a little bit more interesting, and sometimes you don't really need to do that.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes the solution is a lot simpler and all you gotta do is just add, add some.	CHITCHAT
Just add some black or like whatever color your line work is like.	CHITCHAT
Just fill it in and you might find that it's going to help you relational out before you start going crazy and and doing a bunch of like crazy stuff.	CHITCHAT
We just don't need to do to make it more interesting.	CHITCHAT
Now obviously I only had a little bit down here, but to give you a prime example of what I'm talking about, when I was in college at a teacher that always have a straw, these like really crazy splash pages.	CHITCHAT
It was just kind of like a train of thought.	CHITCHAT
And when when you would do that?	CHITCHAT
Then you would take a little piece of paper, cut square in it, put it on top of this complex image, and find a really basic area, and then find a way to fill in part of it black and you make another interesting image.	CHITCHAT
It was really fascinating.	CHITCHAT
Little was a fun kind of module.	CHITCHAT
A string line somewhere.	CHITCHAT
I'll boy.	CHITCHAT
How far back do I need to go?	CHITCHAT
It was a fun exercise.	CHITCHAT
OK, I went way far back.	O
OK, let's let's redo part of this.	O
Let's merge these guys down anyway.	O
A lot.	CHITCHAT
I see I only like games kid.	CHITCHAT
64 so fast, so stressed.	CHITCHAT
I actually have one of the PlayStation classics here in little studio space, and it's also left.	CHITCHAT
I don't plan enough actually to be honest with you, but it's it's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
I do like the old school games.	CHITCHAT
25 and 64?	CHITCHAT
Definitely, that's.	CHITCHAT
I do like I do like the new console games are a lot like I play PlayStation outside of it.	CHITCHAT
Who's your favorite N64 game?	CHITCHAT
I was like my load bowling a lot.	CHITCHAT
I feel like everyone is going to say goldeneye.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of games crash bandicoot, knowing that crash bandicoot PlayStation Wanna Sing Banjo Kazooie there we go.	CHITCHAT
I had a good one earlier and now I don't like what I'm making.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's add in this little guy here.	O
And you know whatever that is.	O
Also, going to the bone.	O
So the bone is just a big kind of circular thing.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Shut up.	CHITCHAT
Can Layer.	O
There we go.	O
Now we got ourselves a vector hand.	O
So vector Zombie.	O
Mickey Mouse, whatever hand wanna call it.	O
Oh my God, Zelda was a great game.	CHITCHAT
I wonder what my reaction just looked like everybody whenever that sell.	CHITCHAT
That was fun.	CHITCHAT
Alright so we got our hand.	O
And this is looking pretty basic, so I shut my linework off.	O
Now it's time to do all the fun stuff, color and detail that sort of stuff.	O
We are 34 minutes in, plenty of time to finish this up.	CHITCHAT
See order.	CHITCHAT
You mean Duke Nukem or wait?	CHITCHAT
Was it called?	CHITCHAT
No was about mythical Duke Nukem and Pok√©mon Stadium.	CHITCHAT
I'll talk about saving was a great game.	CHITCHAT
Program.	CHITCHAT
I like to compute.	CHITCHAT
Newcomb was fun.	CHITCHAT
I can remember my cousin had it on PC, recent download on my grandfathers computer.	CHITCHAT
When we go to visit them and he got really angry 'cause he thought that it was not appropriate for children which it really was not appropriate for children.	CHITCHAT
Any fans out there?	CHITCHAT

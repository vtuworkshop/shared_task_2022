No.	CHITCHAT
Now we had.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool, so we got our hand second Chubby.	O
Let's add some color.	O
Let's add some detail.	O
Let's let's let's finish this guy up.	O
So for color, here's how I pick my colors.	O
You can go to either way either side, so just so everybody knows I move this toolbar out of wax my videos down in the bottom corner you can go down here if you pull it off and you move it somewhere else, you get 2 color wheels.	O
They both do the same thing.	O
I always reference my.	CHITCHAT
I always reference my my my CC library that I have.	O
I have one called colors rule that they were ones where I put all my colors.	O
Tons of 'em I just sometimes I just go on and find color palettes and save it to hear like and you can do this through.	O
Through an image capture, we can go to color.com.	O
You can search the color, so I'll put that.	O
You are all down in the description later.	O
It's colored out adobe.com and click there.	O
You can start saving stuff.	O
Your CC library, then you can reference it on your favorite apps.	O
Which software?	CHITCHAT
I'm using Adobe fresco also.	O
Thank you because you're saying it's going alright, so let's pick some cool linework color every time I do is always like to go with the background color first or I shouldn't say always.	O
I'm starting.	O
Don't like to go the background color first.	O
You know we're talking bout zombie hands earlier, so this might be kind of fun.	O
So the paint bucket selected who made a vector background and now I can just tap on my line work and fill it all in really quick with with the color of my choice like this Gray is pretty dope.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of hard to see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here say something best color palette.	CHITCHAT
This was kinda funny.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Thinking like background colors and odd school.	O
Let's fill are handing actually let's.	O

I don't like the hand color, but I like the line work in the background.	O
The hand is like.	O
Intense.	O
It looks like a sports team.	O
This could be Diablo game with come out now I know man I'm the same way man that game is.	CHITCHAT

So right now again, I'm just I'm toying with colors, I'm just trying to find something that that's going to work for this, and I think I'm narrowing in.	O

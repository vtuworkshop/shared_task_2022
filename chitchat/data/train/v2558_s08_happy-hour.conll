But you know, obviously you can change this to any way you want.	O
You are.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's do that.	O
Oh, that's fun.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's really funny.	CHITCHAT
Let's make that line order little darker about.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Not so good.	O
Alright, we're gonna stick with this color palette 'cause this is really cool.	O
I'm digging this alright, so let's add some detail we got.	O
We got 20 minutes left ago here.	CHITCHAT
Just out of Curiosity, General Bible Group.	CHITCHAT
Rall friends, he can be as honest as you want.	CHITCHAT
When watching these kinds of streams, do you prefer to see longer streaks or shorter stream?	CHITCHAT
So I do kind of a mixed bag?	CHITCHAT
OK, we will see you later.	CHITCHAT
Follow me on here on the hands.	CHITCHAT
It's behance.net backslash, fresh cake or just click on my profile.	CHITCHAT
There should be like a little icon somewhere on the screen.	CHITCHAT
You can click do me a follow 'cause then you'll get notifications when I go live.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
Do you like longer, strange to artist like my Saturday night stream is fairly long.	CHITCHAT
You know roughly two to three hours.	CHITCHAT
This stream is a solid hour and then my time lapse is our five minutes, so let me know what you like.	CHITCHAT
I'll try to do more of it.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, adding in detail, let's add hairs inside tiny little hairs, so we're going to take our brush.	O
We're going to keep the velocity dynamic, pressure, dynamic, onward, Turner, brush size down to like 3.5 and we're going to keep our color of our line work.	O
I'm on a new layer and we're just going to draw in some like little, kinda like Grossness because all my things are gross.	O
I've really taken to like disgusting art like just put in my hairs and blemishes and Macy's.	CHITCHAT
This seems appropriate right now since you have to wash your hands every 5 seconds.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
Sure.	CHITCHAT
Just realize about like.	CHITCHAT
If you are checking this out, your near the stream.	CHITCHAT
The number has gone up since I last looked up at my monitor to see who all is viewing.	CHITCHAT
If you don't know what's going on right now, my name is fresh cake.	CHITCHAT
Oh my real name is Jayden Disimone, but I go buy fresh cake and that's how I know here on my hands.	CHITCHAT
I am an illustrator.	CHITCHAT
A whole lot of my inspiration comes from like old 90s cartoons.	CHITCHAT
Things like Rocko's modern life Rugrats, Ed, Edd and Eddy Grim Adventures, Billy Mandy.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that will last one qualifies us 90s but late 90s early 2000s cat dog.	CHITCHAT
Anything that was on Nickelodeon at any point in time.	CHITCHAT
And that's kind of where I get my style from.	CHITCHAT
Renton be that's another big one and this stream that you're watching right now is called happy hour.	CHITCHAT
It is one hour 60 minutes.	CHITCHAT
I drink beer currently tonight.	CHITCHAT
I'm having the New England Brewing Co better known as Nabco Sea Hag IPA.	CHITCHAT
6.2% alcohol by volume in a 12 ounce can and it's fantastic.	CHITCHAT
Highly recommend getting it if you can.	CHITCHAT
If you live in the New England area, it's kind of a stable.	CHITCHAT
I think for most people in their French, neko is located in Woodbridge, Connecticut.	CHITCHAT
It is.	CHITCHAT
If you ever go to the brewery or find yourself there, don't be thrown off.	CHITCHAT
It's in the back lot of like an old is zoozoo like car place or something like that but it's a fantastic little brewery limited.	CHITCHAT
Great beer.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Look up.	CHITCHAT
Oh, also anyone in here beer fans?	CHITCHAT
Actually that's watching let me know kind of try to make zombie krone fire.	CHITCHAT

I do animate things every so often, so here's a fun fact for anyone that's curious.	CHITCHAT
If you use Instagram or I message and you have giffy.	CHITCHAT
Download, excuse me do you have jiffy downloaded on your phone?	CHITCHAT
You get access to gifts and stuff on your iMessage.	CHITCHAT
If you have Facebook or Instagram you can just search in a little gift search 'cause they use Giphy to power it.	CHITCHAT

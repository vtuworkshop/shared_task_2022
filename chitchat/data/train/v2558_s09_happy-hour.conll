Realize it and add any kind of like fingernails on this hand, so I hope that doesn't bother anybody now the cartoony.	O

So if anyone's curious, as if there's a rhyme or reason for little marks I'm adding there is not I am just tap it around in space.	O
It's just to add some texture you know at a little detail, give it a little something.	O
Make it kind of stand out.	O
Sometimes I add highlights which maybe I'll do that with this one.	O
This we kind of found it, so sometimes a nice way to like comply with those highlights.	O
Now I need away Superman, so take your end, taper off, turn off progression, dynamic over velocity dynamics turnover blush so something like 99.5, sometimes a really cool way to add implied highlights.	O

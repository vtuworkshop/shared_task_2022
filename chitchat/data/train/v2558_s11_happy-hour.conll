Try to take music that kind of goodbye to listen to while drawing.	CHITCHAT
Try not to get anything too crazy.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry if it is repetitive.	CHITCHAT
I want to start trying to do more playlists with different music that doesn't just repeat, but for now it gets the job done.	CHITCHAT
So again, we're just adding in some shading.	O
Just kind of give it a little depth.	O
For people who are new, that just turned in.	CHITCHAT
My name is French cake or real name is Dayton, but I go buy fresh cake.	CHITCHAT
That's how I'm now.	CHITCHAT
Here on Behance and elsewhere on Instagram you can give me a follow at eat fresh cake.	CHITCHAT
I made fun, colorful illustrations.	CHITCHAT
Mainly inspired by 90s cartoons and extremely watching specifically is called happy hour.	CHITCHAT
It's where all the week days is an hour long stream.	CHITCHAT
I sit here, I drink beer, I talk about it today I'm drinking sea hag by New England Brewing Co.	CHITCHAT
We talk about being in the chat.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I play cool smooth jams.	CHITCHAT
I guess an kind of just hang out really to be honest with you, it's like a happy hour anywhere.	CHITCHAT
Just hang out, chat and there's a little bit of drawing that goes on for about an hour.	CHITCHAT
I do run other streams if you give me a follow on Behance, it'll tell you when I go live and run another stream called late night with fresh cake that happens on Saturday nights, usually somewhere around 9:00 or 10:00 o'clock.	CHITCHAT
I post that I'm BI weekly times on Mondays so you can check in with Maine.	CHITCHAT
And seeing working progress following this can check in the stories you'll see when I'm going to be streaming.	CHITCHAT
In that stream specifically, I think we're almost done with this Patch.	CHITCHAT
That seems a little bit longer.	CHITCHAT
I sit here, I draw an it's pretty much just main labitan drawn for like 2 1/2 hours or something crazy and then Friday is usually around noon.	CHITCHAT
I do a time lapse, take all the drawings I did during the week like the main ones, mainly from this stream and I run through a quick time lapse.	CHITCHAT
I can show you what this one will look like.	CHITCHAT
This fresco exports them, but it's a big stream.	CHITCHAT
Out of all these time lapses and you can watch the entire process from start to finish.	CHITCHAT
Generally, in under 5 minutes so.	CHITCHAT
Pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Like I said, we're coming around now.	CHITCHAT
We got a few minutes left here.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll add some quick highlights in this character.	O
I don't know what I'm going to do more to it.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I export as a PDF, bring it into illustrator and I had some gradients and some fun stuff like that.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
So that's probably where this drawing will end up and it'll get posted on Instagram and will get posted here in the hands will be super cool.	CHITCHAT
So following both these places also I should have mentioned that's what the time-lapse looks like.	CHITCHAT
By the way and I almost export it to my own computer.	O
I should have mentioned head over to my website down here.	CHITCHAT
Eat fresh cake com there's pretty much loops you back to this spot.	CHITCHAT
It also takes you to there's a button to click taste in my studio site.	CHITCHAT
Going to the client works of different companies I work with.	CHITCHAT
Everyone from like Manafort for different places, everybody from like WWE, MTV, Nickelodeon.	CHITCHAT
Currently works awesome.	CHITCHAT
Super cool rad people that work there.	CHITCHAT
So check that out like you can totaly.	CHITCHAT
You know kind of get a vibe for all the stuff I do 'cause I don't just draw illustration.	CHITCHAT
I do a lot of graphic design in motion design work as well.	CHITCHAT
Hi from Portland.	CHITCHAT
Hey Gelato from Portland.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm just going to kind of round out.	CHITCHAT
I think we're coming down to the last last few minutes here.	CHITCHAT
Like I said no time, no time.	CHITCHAT
Like we have time to chat afterwards.	CHITCHAT
I just tried to finish the illustration in under an hour, really.	CHITCHAT
Personal balance It's called happy hour.	CHITCHAT
It makes sense, so we've got some work here.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some quick highlights and this will take 2 seconds.	O
So we're going to duplicate, right?	O
Boom, we're going to take our paint bucket hitter toggle.	O
We're going to delete the fill color from the hand.	O
We're going to create a new layer and we're going to select our brush.	O
Make it white.	O
Or just going to literally go like this.	O
It was going to trace long.	O
Besides really easy real quick.	O
Clean that up.	O
Come.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Cool, I will pull over on phone.	O
So we got these kind of highlights going now in the hand.	O
I just realized Mr Shading missing, so will fix that, but to kind of the whites little aggressive so we're just going to turn it down a little bit just to kind of imply that there is some head shaking their crazy.	O

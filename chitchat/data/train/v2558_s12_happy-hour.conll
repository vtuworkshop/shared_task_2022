I do need to add in.	O
Now here.	O
Somebody asked me about this the other day actually, and while we're finishing up here, I'll bring it up since we're on the hour mark whenever I do my shading, it's really simple.	CHITCHAT
All I do is I trace along the line like I create my awkward shape like you see here, and then I just trace.	CHITCHAT
You can't see what I'm doing currently, but I trace along.	CHITCHAT
The the outline and I'm using the same color as normal Ojai from Sydney, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
How are you holding up and how you holding up over there?	CHITCHAT
Things are pretty crazy and then you can kind of see when I close that line by tracing along right here.	O
It'll add time.	O
It'll be able to fill in with paint bucket.	O
I hope that made sense.	O
If that didn't make any sense, head over to my last stream that I did.	O
Watch the replay.	O
I think it's somewhere like look through the chat somewhere like in like the two hour mark so ask how I do it.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm doing is shading.	O
In a lot of detail.	O
Anyway, there is our hand, that's it.	O
That's the hour mark.	CHITCHAT
This is a happy hour fresh cake here will go like this.	CHITCHAT
I know it will hide everything so we can all look at it.	CHITCHAT
We can critique it.	CHITCHAT
This is like the artist critique time.	CHITCHAT
Now you know what do we all think?	CHITCHAT
I mean, do it?	CHITCHAT
Did you like it?	CHITCHAT
So I'll just float it on the screen so everything enjoy.	CHITCHAT
Let me know what we think about that's good.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool pilots.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so we made a fun little cartoon hand again.	CHITCHAT
This stream is called happy hour.	CHITCHAT
It stored in weekdays.	CHITCHAT
It's right now.	CHITCHAT
It's at 6:00 o'clock.	CHITCHAT
That might be.	CHITCHAT
That might change.	CHITCHAT
It might be like 7 depending on when people start going back to work and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
But currently extremes during the weekdays, Mondays and Wednesdays at six o'clock will be another one.	CHITCHAT
This Wednesday I'm going to be drawing more hands this week.	CHITCHAT
We're doing hands for like a whole hand thing.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to draw a couple hands.	CHITCHAT
I drink beer during this stream, so I already emailed already, gave me hope, said your name right again.	CHITCHAT
Now already gave me a whole selection of different types of beers to try.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to see if maybe I can land some before my next stream.	CHITCHAT
If not I am going to be drinking a narraganset lager 'cause the Super basic, but once I find something else.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you're full Arkansas.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I am from Connecticut.	CHITCHAT
Anyone out there from Connecticut where my Connecticut peeps at?	CHITCHAT
I'll give a second for people to reply.	CHITCHAT
I feel like that always sounds like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah right now.	CHITCHAT
Mostly they're all healthy, but they had friends and stuff that I've gotten.	CHITCHAT
It is getting kind of rocky here where I live.	CHITCHAT
The whole like Connecticut, New Jersey, New York area.	CHITCHAT
So I stay inside in this garage where I now live.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, I drink beer on this dream.	CHITCHAT
I'm drinking nabco or New England brewing to, but like I said, better known as that cold.	CHITCHAT
They gotta cool illustration of the sea hag.	CHITCHAT
Is called sea hag.	CHITCHAT
It is an IPA.	CHITCHAT
It is delicious.	CHITCHAT
Edited on top it says drink it.	CHITCHAT
It's good.	CHITCHAT
Little messages, that's why I'm looking.	CHITCHAT
You're gonna OK.	CHITCHAT
That's weird.	CHITCHAT
Pretty sure the bottom I can right now so you're gonna die, clown.	CHITCHAT
Here I'll show it to you.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm gonna give up.	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty sure that's what that says.	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Cool, that's a weird thing to put on the bottom of the camp.	CHITCHAT
Used to say absolutely didn't kill himself on the bottom.	CHITCHAT
They can, so now goes pretty crafty with their dates.	CHITCHAT
If you have a can of this in your fridge, read the bottom.	CHITCHAT
See what it says.	CHITCHAT
Mine says you're going to die clown, so we'll see.	CHITCHAT
To learn.	CHITCHAT
Awesome hey from Turkey.	CHITCHAT
Also, thank you so much for watching.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, Vivian jump back in.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you're glad you're digging the friendly vibe.	CHITCHAT
Try really hard to keep it fun.	CHITCHAT
I don't like taking things too seriously so.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm signing off I'm 4 minutes over my time.	CHITCHAT
My name is fresh cake.	CHITCHAT
You can go to my website eatfreshkink.com you can get to anything from there.	CHITCHAT
That pretty much takes you back here to watch my streams.	CHITCHAT
It also will take you to my studio site.	CHITCHAT
There is a shop that is coming eventually, probably after this whole code in 19 thing you know dies out because I got a supplier and I gotta make sure shipping isn't really that fruitful right now.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of hard to launch a ecommerce store.	CHITCHAT
Plus people unfortunately or not.	CHITCHAT
You know making as much money as they work as people are losing their jobs.	CHITCHAT

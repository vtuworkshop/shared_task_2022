Right click on your outer layer panel and here guys you can see.	O
Scholars you can apply just like this.	O
I will apply uhm, let's see red color to my sketch later because I will know this is my sketch layer and this is not a final Erin.	O
I definitely will need to delete this layer or later on and because of that I applied a red a color so its visual screaming its red color.	O
Redouble attention so.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
Uh, let's talk about brushes.	CHITCHAT
I will start with a pencil or brush.	O
And as I told many, many times during our streams, I have are created separate library with my favorite brushes in Photoshop.	O
Why?	CHITCHAT
Why I create a separate library with my favorite Photoshop brushes if I can organize my brushes in a brush panel it's simple guys BIH cause I would like to use my favorite brushes.	O
My favourites photo shop brushes in Adobe fresco.	O
I created this separately library so.	O
No, I can open this library in Adobe Frisco and I will be able to use all my favourites for the shop and brushes in Adobe fresco.	O
By the way it'll be Frisco is Adobe mobile painting application by the way.	O
Very awesome application so I will click on HB pencil just like that and I will change color for my brush.	O
I will use a blue collar guys you can use any color for your sketch by blue particular.	O
Uh, particularly blue today because as I said today we will be using very bright colors to bring our mood up.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And of course you can use high, high high of course guys you can use your imagination to create your a butterfly, or you can use any reference image.	O
Today I'm using reference image like it did in my another minute or so.	CHITCHAT
This is my um.	CHITCHAT
The command with symmetry, a painting a future.	O
Now I will start creating my butterfly just like that.	O
Pay attention to my document guys.	O
I'm using only one side of my document.	O
Look at this and photo shop creates everything to in other side.	O
Basically Photoshop mirrors everything to in other side of my document.	O
Look at this.	CHITCHAT
How easy is it now?	CHITCHAT
Be cause a particular this a butterfly is very symmetrical.	CHITCHAT
Symmetry painting books absolutely amazing in this a particle example so.	CHITCHAT
Now start working on a butterflies wings.	O
Gosh, you can use uh, you can create your a butterfly in any style you like.	O
You can use any shape, it's your imagination.	O
It's your art.	CHITCHAT
Just a create something.	CHITCHAT
Ah, very unique?	CHITCHAT
Uh, create artery which represents your soul and your vision.	O
This is the most important rule.	O
And again, guys, you can use your imagination or you can create.	O
You can use any image as a reference image.	O
This is our first part of our butterfly wing and now I will start working on another side.	O
And again, guys.	CHITCHAT
Use your imagination.	CHITCHAT
Create something very unique.	CHITCHAT
And by by the way, guys, when you working on.	O
Sketch, or, um, any other a brush stroke.	O
I will recommend you to apply short brush short brush strokes and release your hand short.	O
A brush stroke and release your hand.	O
Why if you will ask me why we are using photo shop or we can undo anything or we can fix anything in Photoshop.	O
Definitely will we can but why?	CHITCHAT
Why?	CHITCHAT
We need to make our, uh.	O
Workflow more complete, complicated if we can make something easier, let's do it.	O
So this is my basic sketch.	O
Now I will create a new empty layer just like that.	O
Uh, I created extra alert, so this is my knew layer.	O
I will switch to my brushes panel and here guys.	O
As you know I have a lot of watercolor brushes I downloaded from Adobe website an I downloaded this brushes for free.	O

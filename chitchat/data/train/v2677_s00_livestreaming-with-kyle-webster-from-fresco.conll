Alrighty.	CHITCHAT
Let's try this.	CHITCHAT
The live stream today here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be using a linking brush here to draw.	O
So I think I'll use the bloody.	O
There we go.	O
And this brush gives you a nice dotted line like this.	O
Fun to use for just straight up inkling with no plan whatsoever in mind, I thought it be fun to draw some reactions to.	CHITCHAT
The current state of affairs and state of the world.	CHITCHAT
Some of you might feel.	CHITCHAT
Anxious, so I thought maybe we could.	CHITCHAT
Just draw.	CHITCHAT
Somebody feeling anxious to start with that?	CHITCHAT
It's totally normal to feel that way.	CHITCHAT
It's a crazy time, whoops.	CHITCHAT
I made that one finger way too long.	O
There.	O
You never know what you're gonna get with this brush.	O
It's one of the things I love about it is.	O
We're going to get a different.	O
Rich the line.	O
Every single time.	O
This person.	O
Killing their mouth open here with.	O
Fear.	O
Totally normal real feeling something right now, right?	CHITCHAT
Hey Ryan, thanks for joining in.	CHITCHAT
There is nothing wrong with feeling.	CHITCHAT
Anxious right now so.	CHITCHAT
Just draw some of those things were feeling.	O
Go ahead and throw me a suggestion in the chat there is an emotion you're feeling right now.	CHITCHAT
She want to draw.	CHITCHAT
Something.	CHITCHAT
Said fear, maybe some of you are just feeling totally relaxed and enjoying.	CHITCHAT
Being on your own, feeling like it's perfectly fine to have this little moment of solitude.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you're enjoying.	CHITCHAT
Hanging out and um.	CHITCHAT
Being alone with your thoughts.	CHITCHAT
If you are, you might be in the minority, but that's fine.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let me know about it.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to draw a bunch of stuff today here.	O
Just random things.	O
But I wanted to start to warm up here just with.	O
Drawings of people's reactions to what's going on right now in the world so.	O
If you're curious where I'm drawing this is Adobe fresco.	O
It's a free app you can get on the iPad.	O
Brian says he's eager for the weekend, eager for the weekend.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, well, strong feeling of eager for the weekend.	CHITCHAT
I could do that.	CHITCHAT
And something I could draw.	CHITCHAT
Hey folks, let me know by the way of the music in the background is too loud.	CHITCHAT
Hello tunes going on in the background here.	CHITCHAT
Hey Trevor, nice to see.	CHITCHAT
Hey Jed, you feel defeated.	CHITCHAT
Woof, that's a tough one.	CHITCHAT
You know what I think I'll draw that, let's draw that.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to have somebody on.	CHITCHAT
Defeated totally fine to feel that way.	CHITCHAT
We're all feeling a little tired right now, right?	CHITCHAT
It's been a.	CHITCHAT
Been a trying time.	CHITCHAT
A lot of folks.	CHITCHAT
And that's fine.	CHITCHAT
No shame in that game.	CHITCHAT
There's only so much you can take right?	CHITCHAT
And then sometimes just have to admit that you need a break.	CHITCHAT
You need to just step away from the news, OK?	CHITCHAT
And that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Remember when I was a kid?	CHITCHAT
Parents will sometimes have the news on and it was a once a day thing.	CHITCHAT
You know it was in the evenings.	CHITCHAT
6:00 o'clock we could say, Oh, Hey, you want to see the news?	CHITCHAT
Yeah sure.	CHITCHAT
Solid hour of news done.	CHITCHAT
We're getting bombarded, right?	CHITCHAT
We get the part about news and I just don't think were built to be able to handle that.	CHITCHAT
It's too much, too much for everybody, right?	CHITCHAT
So take a break, do some drawing to meditation.	CHITCHAT
Do some reading.	CHITCHAT
Take a walk, but don't forget if you take a walk to do some good social distance in right.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so there that's.	CHITCHAT
That's our person feeling a little bit to feed it totally fine.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
So Jed said feeling defeated.	CHITCHAT

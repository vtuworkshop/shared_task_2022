Hey, I get it me too I understand, but other feelings.	CHITCHAT
Let's order some positive feelings were getting at it is maybe we feel like there is some optimism that can come out of this.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we're realizing that humans are better than we thought as a group in terms of supporting one another.	CHITCHAT
I've noticed a lot of support, at least for the on line art community.	CHITCHAT
People retweeting other peoples work.	CHITCHAT
People pointing out where people can buy a prince and things like that for other folks.	CHITCHAT
And that's encouraging, right?	CHITCHAT
So yeah, Brittany.	CHITCHAT

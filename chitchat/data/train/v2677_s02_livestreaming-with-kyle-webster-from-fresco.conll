And it's the weekend, right?	CHITCHAT
It's coming up coming up on us here, sneaking out.	CHITCHAT
All right, Sir, for sand.	CHITCHAT
Why don't we?	CHITCHAT
So we're going to have a little Horizon Line back there.	O
And the water.	O
I have one little wave right there.	O
And another one right there, look bigger.	O
And I also think that.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna have a palm tree.	O
Just peaking in here from the side, OK.	O
Brian, I don't serve because I'm terrified of sharks so there.	CHITCHAT
That's just the way it is.	CHITCHAT
I'm terrified of sharks and I blame jaws.	CHITCHAT
I saw that movie when I was too young.	CHITCHAT
I saw jaws when I was Gosh, maybe 1112 years old.	CHITCHAT
Too young to see that movie and it just ruined.	CHITCHAT
The ocean for me.	CHITCHAT
Although I love going to the beach and looking at the water and standing at it maybe like ankle deep at the most.	CHITCHAT
But now I'm not not a server, not a server.	CHITCHAT
Oh well, are you?	CHITCHAT
Leaking happy little ways.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we're going to be able to do a Bob Ross here.	CHITCHAT
Happy, this happy that.	CHITCHAT
I did some cloud shapes in there OK.	O
Happy little clouds.	O
Yeah, I mean I can't see what's in the water, right?	CHITCHAT
That's the thing, I can't see what's down there.	CHITCHAT
If I had a way to do that.	CHITCHAT
If I could, if I could really scope it out.	CHITCHAT
Before just jumping in, I think I feel a lot better so.	CHITCHAT
It's for a little surfer back here too, because somebody actually surfing on wave.	O
Maybe I'll do that.	O
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
All Right, This is going to be kind of a very isn't very graphic illustration.	O
Once a graphic, what I mean is?	O
Shape based OK, so why don't we knock this back?	O
Let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Knock this back.	O
The Opacity of this layer just going to.	O
Make that a lot lighter and I'm going to start using the lasso tool.	O
Think shapes.	O
Right, so there we go.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about all the tapping.	CHITCHAT
By the way, we're working on figuring out an intelligent way using artificial intelligence to knockout.	CHITCHAT
Some of the tapping sound you hear in the background.	CHITCHAT
When I'm tapping that Apple pencil.	CHITCHAT
On my.	CHITCHAT
Screen OK so.	CHITCHAT
This.	O
N.	CHITCHAT
An out And straight on down so the shapes you see you're going to be very.	O
Sort of oversimplified here.	O
And that's going to be a style choice.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Now I can add to my selection anytime I'm picking up the Stylus.	O
An I'm just adding.	O
As I go right?	CHITCHAT
Making a silhouette for this figure here.	O
Tapping into bad, Brian says cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright music too loud for you folks in the background.	CHITCHAT
Too soft.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
We want to make sure that I'm not blasting years with the music of that run in the background.	CHITCHAT
Now let's see some watercolor, so I think I'll use the Wash softap brushes, a lovely one, and I'm just going to grab a color here.	O
How much water?	CHITCHAT
How much paint do you want?	CHITCHAT
Here's how much paint I have in my brush.	O
People keep the flow at about 75.	O
Keep the water maybe about like 50 or so.	O
And just start flooding it with this.	O
Just let it listen paint.	O
There we go.	O
Grab another color.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Pile that in there like so.	O
So when I said is.	CHITCHAT
Lovely.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Now while I've got it selected.	O
I can grab another brush, right?	O
So I'll do that right now.	O
And I can use this other brush as a Photoshop brush.	O
With it, you know everything can be done in the same layer.	O
I'm not afraid of working on one layer.	O
And let's use the block stain brush.	O
That's one of my favourites.	CHITCHAT
All right, I've deselected.	O
And I'm going to make another selection here.	O

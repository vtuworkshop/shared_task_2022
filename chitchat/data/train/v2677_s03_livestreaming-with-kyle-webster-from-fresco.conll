For the bathing suit.	O
Leave room for those fingers at hand.	O
And then just start painting.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And then I'm going to use this brush here.	O
To draw.	O
Star.	O
Actually, stick with the same brush.	O
No.	O
Lock screen and see I like that brush because what it does is it leaves a little bit of stuff coming through.	O
Let me just hide that sketch for a moment.	O
You see how that looks?	CHITCHAT
That's fun, right?	CHITCHAT
All right, and if I want to play with my silhouette and mess around with fixing that up, I can use the lasso tool as well.	O
So I'm feeling like I want a little more shape to that leg, so I'll just go ahead and do this.	O
And erase.	O
And come in and out here and erase right.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I like that.	CHITCHAT
Actually, you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to change this leg.	O
It's a work in progress.	O
I mean what I like to do is just make shapes and then edit as I go, right?	O
I think it looks kind of funny.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking for a little bit of humor in this to have the legs just be these skinny little things at the bottom with almost no cabs that just seems funny to me and I like that.	CHITCHAT
I like that.	CHITCHAT
So just trim off a little bit here.	O
And that's why I'm going to build this illustration shapes painting inside their shapes and then carrying on that way, alright?	O
So let's turn our sketch back on and see how we're doing.	O
Great, alright, I can work on a layer now.	O
Above this an I can add that her.	O
So we'll just cut in here.	O
And that's going to be our silhouette there.	O
By the way, we have a built-in smoothing feature for the lasso tool here in Frisco, which is nice, so I'm not having to be all that precise with what I draw.	O
It actually is intelligently kind of like smoothing as I go.	O
And making sure that I'm painting something that looks somewhat decent.	O
Here's some choices I can make.	CHITCHAT
I can base my the Brown color I used for the hair on the yellow by going darker in that Hugh.	O
So one option I could also go with that original skin tone I was using and go darker there.	O
Either way, what I know I'm doing here is I'm using harmonious color right?	O
So let's give this a shot, see how it looks.	CHITCHAT
It's kinda nice I like that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that way that's the way to go.	CHITCHAT
Very nice.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
All right, now we've got to make sure that we're going to get that surfboard in there and get that other hand taking care of all that can wait.	O
what I want to do now is I want to actually throw in the background.	O
The reason being haikara nice to see you.	CHITCHAT
Hey Colin Chang, nice to see you as well.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's see here why don't we throw a little background layer in here?	O
And I will take advantage of filling alright with colored.	O
Just to get things started.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's do that and take my paint bucket tool.	O
And let's go for like almost a totally green no no no.	O
OK, here's what I'm gonna do.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna make the water have the greenish tint and make the Sky have a much blue are.	O
Much bluer tint will go really light for this to start and see how that looks with everything else.	O
All right there we go nice.	CHITCHAT
OK, how's that so far so good and for the water I think I'm gonna go for a much deeper, greenish kind of color.	O
So let's push this up towards the greens, OK?	O
And bring this down.	O
So adjusting the value there.	O
And now I'm going to use my.	O
Selection tool here for.	O
Rectangular marchitto square or rectangular selection tool.	O
And let's just do this.	O
OK, make it simple.	O
Go ahead and tap to fill.	O
And that's going to be that ocean color.	O
OK, I think that looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Alrighty, Alrighty.	CHITCHAT

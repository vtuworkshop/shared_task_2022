All right now for the sand.	O
Do I wanna use that same yellow without it give me some color harmony all the way through out something like that might be a pretty good choice.	O
You want to keep things simple.	O
I could do that.	CHITCHAT
I could move it lighter so it's in the same.	O
It's the same Hue.	O
I'm just pushing it a little bit lighter, right?	O
And that could work as well.	O
And I'll just be bold here and use my last web tool again and just go for it is going to make a shape you.	O
So I'm going to go up here in this layer still sitting behind my surfer here, right?	O
And I'm going to go in out and then back in and out again.	O
Like that, and I think that's going to be a nice shape, will fill that and see how it looks.	O
Not bad, right?	CHITCHAT
I think we're getting somewhere it looks OK to me.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
How about this palm tree situation?	O
Alright, we wanna do there.	O
Well follow the same rules I've been using, which is to use my lasso tool, make a selection and go ahead and fill that in.	O
By the way, in the chat, if you've got a moment, tell me what you guys are drawing today, if any.	CHITCHAT
Is anyone out there just at home working on assignment or working on something for fun, tell me what you're doing.	CHITCHAT
I want to know.	CHITCHAT
I want to hear what people are up to.	CHITCHAT
I want to see what you're drawing.	CHITCHAT
It's nice for us all to share the things that we're working on.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's do this.	CHITCHAT
I've got a layer here.	O
And I'm going to come over here and let's just start coming in.	O
We are palm trees.	O
Hey.	CHITCHAT
Obviously I'm not being hyper realistic with this.	O
In the least, there's no part of this drawing that is.	O
Even remotely realistic, and as the point right the style and choosing here is.	O
Super graphic.	O
Yeah, I'll leave a little space for this next one, and I think I'll actually come in from the side.	O
And leave a little hole.	O
For the Sky there and we'll see how that goes alright, how's that?	O
Maybe one more just around it out, and as we go I'll wait and see how things are feeling on the other side of the drawing.	O
Joey is drawing COVID-19 infographics Yikes.	CHITCHAT
Well, uh hey, is it?	CHITCHAT
If it's paid work why not?	CHITCHAT
Oh cool game background design.	CHITCHAT
Angela, that sounds awesome.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, yeah, informing the public is a good thing, right?	CHITCHAT
I agree, why don't we stick with the same brush?	CHITCHAT
We have this block stain brush or hey you know what?	CHITCHAT
We could get a little crazy.	CHITCHAT
We could use an impressionist brush.	O
Right, let's see what that does.	O
Check it out.	CHITCHAT
So how much color variation am I getting in there?	O
A decent amount.	O
Not bad, not bad.	CHITCHAT
So just painting inside the selection, deselect and let's see how that looks alright.	O
I'm feeling that.	CHITCHAT
So far so good.	CHITCHAT
Trevor is working on a textile print for amends woven shirt.	CHITCHAT
Of the Florida Keys, complete with alligators and selfish and kind of jealous, that sounds pretty awesome.	CHITCHAT
I kind of want to do that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's check our drawing is looking without the sketch.	O
This is always a good thing to do.	O
Turn the sketch on and off.	O
Check out how you're doing so far.	O
I'm digging this.	CHITCHAT
I think this is feeling pretty nice.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's turn it back on.	O
And I think next what I'd like to do is get to these clouds.	O
So just above the Sky layer.	O
We have choices here.	O
We have choices.	CHITCHAT
We could make a selection and then just paint inside a solid shape.	O
We could go for something softer.	O
I want to try something here.	CHITCHAT
What I'm going to do is I'm going to make a selection and paint and then I'm thinking maybe I could take the watercolor and soften the edges of part of the selection that I've made.	O
After I paint it, so just as an experiment will give this a shot.	O
OK, so let's go back to that nice block stain brush.	O
Ladies white here.	O
And I'm going to start painting in my cloud.	O
Alright, so alright, that's great.	CHITCHAT
Do you select an?	CHITCHAT
Let's see how that looks and turn off the sketch for a moment.	O
Alright, there's that cloud.	O
I kind of like the way it looks as is, but just as an experiment, I'm going to take my watercolor brush.	O
And I'm going to reset it to its normal values and then increase the spacing a little bit.	O
And add some scatter OK and I'm going to take all the color away so I tap on this little transparent color wheel here and I've got no color and a little bit of water.	O
Alright, let's do this.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just going to come in here at the bottom.	O

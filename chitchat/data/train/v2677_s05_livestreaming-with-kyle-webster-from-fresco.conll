And do that.	O
See this just softening that cloud.	O
Along the bottom edge.	O
See what that does and it's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
I might leave it like that.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
I like that.	CHITCHAT
What do y'all think?	CHITCHAT
Anybody think that looks terrible.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Alright, you know what I'm going to leave it like that?	CHITCHAT
For now, I'm pretty happy with that.	CHITCHAT
He's a bigger brush and just pop it on the bottom there just to.	O
A little bit more irregularity that shape.	O
All right, nobody is fighting me on this.	CHITCHAT
I think I might leave it.	O
Nobody's fighting on this.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There.	O
OK, I can do that again, maybe with another shape.	O
Let's try it out.	O
How come in from?	CHITCHAT
Aside here, just do a smaller one.	O
Now I have to keep in mind that whatever I do is going to also be behind that surfboard, sort my sketch on for just a moment, see where that winds up.	O
OK, this should be safe.	CHITCHAT
Go back to my photo shop brush.	O
All right, we're going to paint in some of that Sky.	O
Cloud skews me that same brush.	O
Alrighty and Justice before I'm going to use that watercolor brush.	O
Just soften.	O
Some of these areas here at the bottom.	O
Couple of areas in top two, why not?	O
Just for some variety.	O
It's kind of interesting.	CHITCHAT
Think I might leave it like that.	CHITCHAT
Can always change my mind.	CHITCHAT
That's the beauty of digital art, right?	CHITCHAT
You're never locked in.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's get to that surfboard.	O
What do you say turn this on?	CHITCHAT
OK, beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Now I think I'll put that just in front of.	O
Our ocean layer.	O
Add a little layer there.	O
FYI, we have unlimited layers in Adobe Frisco, which is pretty awesome so.	O
We don't give you layer limits, you just have to kind of see where you Max out.	O
Eventually, I'm sure the iPad will start saying, hey, I can't handle this anymore, but I have yet to reach that point in my own work, but I'm sure it's a real thing.	CHITCHAT
I'm not taking that shape going to redraw that.	O
Let's do this.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go up.	O
And over.	O
Down.	O
And.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Kind of hard for me to imagine really what is surfboard looks like, honestly don't really know exactly what the shape is, but this feels about right to me.	CHITCHAT
By the way, to deselect all I have to do or to remove from my selection is I use the touch modifier.	O
Hold down this little circle at the bottom right with my thumb and that can remove part of the selection for Maine.	O
Uh, colours, colours, colours, colours, always my weakest thing you know I'm always struggling with color choice here.	CHITCHAT
I do think though that if I start with that purple I was using an just bump it up to a brighter color, an move a little bit more towards red.	O
That might look pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Could also go for sort of a lime green kind of color for the surfboard.	O
That might be nice as well.	CHITCHAT
Let's see how we do here.	CHITCHAT
Let's see how we do.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
This is going to be too close to the skin tone.	O
That's the big question.	CHITCHAT
Let's find out.	CHITCHAT
OK, just start painting it and take a look.	O
Yeah, that's not going to work.	O
Not going to work.	CHITCHAT
What about going to our Sky color and go into a deeper color?	O
For that, I think that might look nice.	O
Let's try that.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I think that might be the ticket.	CHITCHAT
I feel pretty good about that.	CHITCHAT
Take that layer and move it up above our sand so we can actually see it.	O
There.	O
We go nice, nice nice.	CHITCHAT
Looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Also feeling like I want a little variety in that, so I'm going to.	O
Let's see go for that Green as I just said something about lime green a moment ago, so let's go up to like a lime green kind of color.	O
And let's throw a little bit of that in there just to add sort of a cool textural pattern.	O
There we go.	O
Does that look?	CHITCHAT
Thanks Joey.	CHITCHAT
What do you think folks?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that works OK, right?	CHITCHAT
Turn off that sketch and see how we're doing.	O
Cool Okie Dokie, I like it alright.	CHITCHAT

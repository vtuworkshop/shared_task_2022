I'll come back over here to our server and just get rid of part of the arm there.	O
I know this is violence, just watching the cutoff for the arm.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Um, nice nice nice alright I'll take my surfboard.	O
And I'm going to duplicate that layer.	O
OK, just tap on it.	O
And duplicate it and the reason is it's going to make it a little darker.	O
I want a little more contrast there, and then I'm going to merge these layers together.	O
Just tap on it and I say merge down.	O
Now I've got my surfboard on one layer OK.	O
And As for my surfer here.	O
I'm going to actually do the same for her.	O
I'm going to duplicate her.	O
So that she is not.	O
So transparent, alright perfect.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
What's next?	CHITCHAT
Where do we go from here?	CHITCHAT
Where do we go from here?	CHITCHAT
Surfboard surfer ocean.	O
You haven't added those waves yet.	O
I think that will start to.	O
Give us a little bit more personality here.	O
I also got to bring that surfboard down to the sand a bit more, so I'm going to take my selection tool.	O
Come here and add just a bit more.	O
There we go.	O
To that selection.	O
Alrighty.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK, simple is that.	CHITCHAT
That was easy.	CHITCHAT
Nice.	CHITCHAT
An we're dealing with some transparency here with the foot, which I mean, it's kind of cool looking.	O
Pending on the liquor going for in this instance there I think I feel like it's hurting the legibility of the drawing, so I'm actually going to come into my server here.	CHITCHAT
And just add.	O
A little bit more color there.	O
I might be wise to use the same brush as before, so let's do that.	O
I've got that nice watercolor brush.	O
I was using a moment ago.	O
I'll switch over to the flat.	O
There was like something alright, decent amount of water.	O
Do you send amount of flow?	CHITCHAT
Just come in here and.	O
Filled out a little bit.	O
There we go.	O
And if it's looking a little funny in the foot, I can always come back down.	O
Re select And paint inside the selection.	O
Crazy thing about this is being able to paint with wet media inside a selection.	O
I mean that's.	CHITCHAT
So much fun.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's come back out here to our server friend and I'm looking at the hair and I realize.	O
Just wanted.	CHITCHAT
Get that tidied up a little bit right.	O
Come back to that hair color, see how easy it is for me to find the colors.	O
I've been using all the way throughout.	O
I love the color history that makes my life so much easier.	O
And now I'm going to bounce over to an inking brush, so let's see here.	O
What do we have we have?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
You know what else we could do?	CHITCHAT
We could actually let's merge these layers.	O
Here it is.	O
Put him in a group.	O
Myrtle layers.	O
Another thing I could do is sort of carve out facial features with shadows.	O
That might be a nice way to render the face.	O
I don't want too much detail right, so I'm going to do this.	O
I'm just going to make a shape here.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Go up.	O
That Just like that.	CHITCHAT
Make a selection.	O
And make another selection right here.	O
Actually going to add to that a little bit.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
And now I'll take that same color.	O
I had a moment ago.	O
And I'm going to make a layer up here and I'm going to know actually stay on the same way.	O
I want to show you all the trick.	CHITCHAT
Watch this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to set the lock transparency for this layer.	O
Watch this, I'm going to lock the transparency.	O
That means everywhere I paint.	O
I'm not adding pixels.	O
Anywhere outside of the shapes have already painted OK.	O
And I've got there.	O
Currently I had that.	CHITCHAT
Painting I had that block stain brush.	O
I'm going to set the mode of that brush to multiply.	O
And just do this.	CHITCHAT
Not nice.	CHITCHAT
Deselect come back out here.	O
Aaah, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
The only thing I think I did is I think I made all those features too small.	O
So hey, look at this undo undo undo I'll do exactly the same thing.	O
That they started before heads here, so I haven't better sense of what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK.	O
Yeah, let's make everything a little bigger than it was OK.	O

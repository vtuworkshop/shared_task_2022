And I'll come across this way to the neck as well so I can get all the way through.	O
Maybe I'll just do the one side.	O
Let's see how that looks so far, OK?	CHITCHAT
Not too dark, OK?	O
Has ever do I need the other I?	CHITCHAT
Radio silence anybody in the chat way in what I don't know what you think here.	CHITCHAT
Maybe the other I maybe not.	CHITCHAT
No, but I can always do I can just test the waters by doing it and see how it looks right.	O
Let's see how that looks.	CHITCHAT
How's that?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's alright.	CHITCHAT
Not bad.	CHITCHAT
OK so when we leave that there for now and here I just have to do this folks.	CHITCHAT
I've gotta draw.	O
Belly button just had to alright that works for me.	O
So there's are surfer.	O
This is the part where I start to do a little bit of refinement.	O
You know I can't stand having this hand looking like that without any indication of.	O
Separate fingers.	O
So the first thing I'm going to do is erase this area here, Yikes.	O
I take it back, I gotta grab that yellow ha ha ha.	O
Oh there we go alright?	CHITCHAT
Turn that mode back to normal and pain in there.	O
OK?	CHITCHAT
OK, that's a little better.	O
And now let's add that pinky, OK, ready.	O
I think he's going to wrap down an around just like that.	O
I'm going to add a bit more shape here to the.	O
The other fingers.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There OK?	CHITCHAT
Saved And while we're at it.	O
Let's go ahead.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
And this other.	CHITCHAT
And right here OK?	O
How's that not bad?	CHITCHAT
Alright, OK OK.	CHITCHAT
Our server ready to go.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some waves, Angela said yes.	O
Another I OK good, I made the right choice.	CHITCHAT
Thank goodness, thank goodness.	CHITCHAT
All right, back to our water.	O
Now here's a question.	CHITCHAT
If you were doing this illustration, you want to direct the eye towards the server.	O
Well, first of all, it's not too difficult 'cause the most contrast in the illustration is right there at the moment, but you can also use directional cues, so I'm going to actually make the waves move, I think.	O
Let's say I could make them move like sort of towards the left trigger, right towards the right.	O
And this area might help move the eye towards the surfer.	O
So this is a tricky one.	O
That's a tricky one.	CHITCHAT
Um, let's see what that does, so I'll move the wave up.	O
And this will be the shape.	O
OK, that's going to be the general shape.	O
So up this way.	O
All right, and let's see how we how we deal with that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm going to sample that color.	O
Now put the wave on a separate layer.	O
To be safe.	O
OK.	O
And once I've got it painted, I'm going to lock the transparency again.	O
So let's lock that layer transparency.	O
And there we go.	CHITCHAT
Now I can just freely paint in there and not worry about the borders getting messed up.	O
OK, so why don't we do something with one of those newer brushes?	O
That's coming on the way or one of the ones that just got released, like the spring 2020 brushes.	O
Let's take a look at those from Rome and see if you have any cool splashy brushes.	O
And we just so happen to have this splish flash brush right.	O
Solicitous come on how fun is that?	CHITCHAT
Just throw some WAVY.	O
Shapes in like that.	O
And let me deselect or a rather.	O
Get rid of that lock transparency for a moment.	O
And now I can add.	O
A few.	O
Bumpy bits here.	O
Same brush.	O
See how that looks and see what happens if I.	O
Just paint with it low, too much, too much careful.	O
I think that kind of does the trick.	CHITCHAT
Now what I want to do is I want to actually dark in this area here where the wave.	O
Meets the water.	O

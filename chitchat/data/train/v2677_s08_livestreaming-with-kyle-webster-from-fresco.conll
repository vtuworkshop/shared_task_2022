So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back.	O
Oh cristianas, coming in from Rome.	O
Let's see strictly closed loops.	O
Oh, the comment got got deleted.	CHITCHAT
Didn't get to read that Christiana.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Go ahead and repost that comment if he can.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to hear what you're going to say.	CHITCHAT
We don't wanna hear news from Rome.	CHITCHAT
There.	O
And then to soften that transition.	O
Alright, let's go and.	CHITCHAT
Unlock transparency are cristianas back.	O
She says strictly closed in my house.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for your words and for your always interesting live streams.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Kristiana Rae go.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
We're all thinking of you there in Italy it's a tough situation.	CHITCHAT
I think we May.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately, it might be heading in the same direction here in the states, but I'll hold out hope that we can do a decent OK job.	CHITCHAT
Will see, right?	CHITCHAT
Nobody knows, but at least we have art we can hang out together and do this, so this is something that's a little break for everyone.	CHITCHAT
We all need this for brains, right?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
All right now I need to soften that transition, so I'm going to unlock the transparency.	O
And using this.	O
Ocean color here.	O
I'm going to use a different brush.	O
And I'm going to.	O
Points into.	O
She's a Stein Monster saying that settings on that very nice.	CHITCHAT
Just paint into this area here.	O
Trying to soften that transition.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Alrighty.	CHITCHAT
So there's one wave that because it's on its own layer, I can put that wherever I want you know, so we could stay where it was, slide over a little bit.	O
The idea here was to try and get it moving in the direction of the surfer.	O
So what I'd like to do is just do another one.	O
A little shallower.	O
And I use that same brush.	O
Better that darker color using a moment ago.	O
And just go ahead and fill that in.	O
And then use that battery splish splash brush.	O
Person surfing there.	O
And I think underneath it then.	O
Let's carve that out a little better.	O
Just get that shape a little tighter.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Erase that.	O
And underneath it will just paint.	O
A little curl like that.	O
And make that darker alright.	O
And we go.	CHITCHAT
And I can also then.	O
Use a softer brush.	O
Let's use for explicity.	O
I've got some nice soft paint brushes here.	O
The painting category.	O
Let's say we have a color fill, chunky, flat, dry.	O
So many choices, maybe too many, right?	CHITCHAT
I think the soft acrylics a good choice for this.	O
And I'm going to use it as an eraser.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
All I do is I doubled.	O
See this this little touch modifier right here.	O
This is the circle I'm dragging around.	O
If I double tap that, it locks it into eraser mode.	O
So I'm gonna racing with it whatever brush I'm using, right?	O
Just come in here.	CHITCHAT
And just soften that transition a little bit.	O
I'm basically just removing.	O
Bits and pieces of it, right?	O
So it isn't such a hard transition, and that's what I'm doing so we can all see that working out OK.	O
That's nice.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So we got two waves done.	O
Now of course the easy thing to do.	CHITCHAT
Would be and I just saw somebody mentioned this copying and pasting.	CHITCHAT
Let the wave, and that's exactly what I was hoping to do folks.	O
So I want to take this larger one that I made and I'm going to select it.	O
OK right there.	O
And I'm going to come over to that layer and just say copy selection.	O
Whoops, there we go.	CHITCHAT
All right, copy selection.	O
And then.	O
Paste selection and it creates it right there and I can slide it over here.	O
Resize it, maybe stretch it out a little bit.	O
OK, little more shallow.	O
And now I've got another wave that I can use right there.	O

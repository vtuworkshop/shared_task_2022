OK, so we leave that there.	O
And that saving a ton of work, right?	O
We've got our ways.	O
We've got our ocean to how about this transition from the ocean to the sand?	O
We don't want that to look so abrupt, Dewey.	CHITCHAT
So let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead.	CHITCHAT
And just make a selection.	O
Around.	O
The whole area there.	O
And then we'll just change the shape of it a little bit as we go, but mostly following that same form.	O
And using that block stain brush again because that's such a nice transparent one.	O
I can go into my block, stain brush, grab some white.	O
And I'm going to use this right over the ocean layer.	O
Over the sand part of me.	O
And I'm just going to do this.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to paint.	O
Thanks so.	CHITCHAT
And add a couple little tabby dots here there.	O
But my boom just pop it in there.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And then I'm going to just.	O
Reduce the opacity OK.	O
Reduce the opacity.	CHITCHAT
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And we'll see how that starting to look a little bit better.	CHITCHAT
For like I still need a little bit more work than that, so let's see what else I can do to solve this problem.	O
Maybe I could move this edge here that I.	O
Painted earlier for the sand to being a little softer, how about we use a brush that has a sort of a scattered dottie kind of appearance, so I'm going to go into my affects brushes, OK?	O
And we have a noise control brush here and I'm going to use it as an eraser, so double tap.	O
On my touch modifier.	O
And let's see what that does.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's getting there, so I make it a little smaller.	O
And just rub it there.	O
Just going to come along the edge here.	O
Like that?	CHITCHAT
I think this might be the ticket.	O
This might be the ticket.	CHITCHAT
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
Better, worse, same.	CHITCHAT
Tell me what you think about that.	CHITCHAT
I think that's kind of starting to do the trick, although I have to say this white shape that I did I think needs a little bit more refinement, so I'll just go ahead and use my lasso tool again.	O
And I'll follow a little more closely here.	O
And erase.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And then it needs a little bit more variety.	O
Here is certain to feel too saini OK, so why don't we just erase that?	O
Variety is the spice of life.	O
That's OK, and now I'm going to actually reduces opacity, just a little more.	O
And I I think that might have been.	O
The ticket.	O
Go back to our water, and here's another thing we're going to try.	O
Selection tool.	O
Let's do this.	CHITCHAT
Just make a few shapes.	O
Let me know if that ACDC is just too loud in the background.	CHITCHAT
My son, my son's favorite band.	CHITCHAT
Just discovered them and everything.	CHITCHAT
So the greatest thing ever.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm doing here is I'm going to just add these little shapes where I can paint some darker water.	O
Just add a bit more visual interest here.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Let's just add a little pop right there.	O
And I'll grab that darker color I was using earlier.	O
For the water, there it is.	O
Come back to one of our wave layers, just pop up over that.	O
And let's let's switch up that brush.	O
I'm going to something softer, so we're going to our painting category again.	O
That same block stain brush has been treating as well and just fill those in.	O
Painting inside selections is just such a easy way to work with your shape based illustrations, right?	O
There as I feel starting to get somewhere.	CHITCHAT
All right now for this and we need to add a little bit more juice.	CHITCHAT
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
I agree, let's do it.	CHITCHAT
Is a little darker here.	O
Push it a little bit more towards orange.	O
And I'm going to go to this and I'm going to.	O
Go ahead and lock the transparency about layer.	O

OK.	O
And let's use another effects brush here.	O
Let's go the effects, and let's use this pattern brush.	O
How about spider mixed?	O
That's always a fun one.	CHITCHAT
Just do a little bit of work there and turn that into.	O
Normal mode.	O
Yeah, I think looking at that fun.	O
That just immediately added life to what we were doing.	O
Thank you, christianna.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
A little bit of that spatter just really makes such a difference.	O
And as I'm looking at it, I'm thinking, hey, why not add a bit more gradation to the Sky?	O
OK, this is how these illustrations come together.	O
As you start with something simple then you start adding detail and refinement as you go.	O
If you remember back when we started right what we started with was just this.	O
This sketch that was really simple.	O
Turn that back on for just a moment and crank up the opacity is you can see that.	O
It was really, you know, this.	CHITCHAT
It was nothing special, OK?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And jump out of there for a moment.	O
Turn that off again, but remember, we really started with something simple.	O
It brushes make it so easy to.	O
I mean, it's really just letting the brushes to a lot of the work so we come to our Sky an why don't we just go ahead and do that same thing?	O
We just did a moment ago.	O
We're going to lock the layer transparency.	O
And I could do that spatter effect I was using, but I think I'm going to do something else.	O
I'm going to go to my.	O
Painting category and use the color fill brush.	O
One of my faves.	O
And will turn it on OK, good son normal and I'm going to make it quite large right?	O
Then bump it up to about 809 hundred pixels.	O
And just start throwing in a slightly darker color there at the top.	O
At sampled, the color from the surfboard that we had there OK.	O
And look at that.	CHITCHAT
You see what that does?	CHITCHAT
Just darkening up that Sky at the top gives us a little gradation from dark to light.	O
That is a nice texture baked into it as well, and that pushes our eyes down towards our main subject, which is of course our server here, OK?	O
An app is really enjoying that spatter brush so much that I think I'll actually go ahead and echo a bit of that patterning into the leaves of the palm tree.	O
Let's see how that works, OK?	CHITCHAT
So we'll go back to FX and there's our lovely spatter mixed brush.	O
And I'm going to take that same darker color I was using and I'm going to lighten it up.	O
A little bit.	O
Push it more towards the green.	O
We'll get a touch of that color that we're using for the surfboard to be echoed here in those leaves.	O
OK, let's come over there, and let's go ahead and lock our transparency on that.	O
Lock transparency.	O
And just paint inside.	O
Look at that, just tap it a few times and see what it does.	O
Not nice.	O
Nothing too complicated keeping it simple.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
There, and I think we really, really getting somewhere, so I think to finish it of- I could add a couple more leaves coming in from the top right if I want.	O
But another thing I could do is actually just add.	O
A little detail such as the silhouette of a bird or two up in the Sky that might really round it out nicely, so I think I'll give that a try to start with.	O
A simple smaller thing first just for a little bit of balanced.	O
So I'm going to use my selection tool again and I'm going to come up here.	O
I'm going to overlap this cloud a little bit alrighty.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Let's use this.	O
And I'll come over here.	O
Bring out a second.	O
Account.	O
Haha, Emmanuel says what?	CHITCHAT
No surf music?	CHITCHAT
Sorry I don't have any of that.	CHITCHAT
My bad my bad.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Already.	CHITCHAT
Go to my selection.	O
No.	O
And let's just do a silhouette of a bird up in the top right.	O
Actually, I might just think this in now that I think of it, instead of using a selection tool, it might be easier to paint it.	O
And see how that works.	O
What choices do I have here?	CHITCHAT
So many inking tools?	O
Oh my goodness sakes.	O
Up Could just go for something clean that would be like the Belgian comics brush or it might do something else that's a little softer.	O
Could use the wet ink brush.	O
I think for this I'm gonna go really precise.	O
And use the fountain pen.	O
And you know, maybe I'll echo some of that hair color or some of that skin tone.	O

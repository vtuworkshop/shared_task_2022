Oh, the choices, the choices.	O
It's just too much.	O
Alright, let's try this.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
How's that for a shape?	O
Are we feeling good about that shape?	CHITCHAT
I kind of like that.	O
I'm just color it in.	O
And see how it feels.	O
Is really low fi here folks, I'm just drawing and coloring color book style rent coloring book, Stylus and it says.	O
Sometimes that's the way to go like that, because little bigger.	O
So we get that sort of feeling of a seagull.	O
And I'm going to go a little lighter.	O
On this wing.	O
To suggest that maybe that wing is hit, it is catching some light.	O
Now maybe that's all you need to kind of balance it out.	O
I mean, I don't know what do you all think?	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's all you need.	CHITCHAT
Always with the same brush.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Can't decide.	CHITCHAT
What do you think good to go?	CHITCHAT
Are we finished?	CHITCHAT
Do we do it?	CHITCHAT
Fountain of youth.	O
Yeah, it's similar.	CHITCHAT
This is similar when Emmanuel.	CHITCHAT
This is the default fountain pen in Frisco.	O
But yeah, it's definitely a similar tool.	O
Can't deny that it didn't influence what I'm using right now.	CHITCHAT
Definitely definitely.	CHITCHAT
Let's go a little darker on that wing about that.	O
Little darker.	O
On the underside of that way.	O
Not trying to get too detailed here, but I just felt like it needed a bit more.	O
More contrast.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
I think we're done.	O
You know, I mean, hey listen, I gotta run.	CHITCHAT
I got other things to do I've got to do some work.	CHITCHAT
I've got it.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure the rest of you as well.	CHITCHAT
How 'bout a cast shadow from the surface is to even got a good idea?	CHITCHAT
We should really do that.	CHITCHAT
Let's finish it off that way.	CHITCHAT
OK, let's do that.	CHITCHAT
Let's do a cast shadow.	O
I think you're on to something there.	CHITCHAT
And I think the way to do that what I'm going to do is paint it with.	O
Belgian comics, and then I'm going to use a layer transparency action.	O
Will set this layer mode.	O
2 multiply OK.	O
Let's go over.	O
Here will say multiply.	O
Why is exactly that?	CHITCHAT
But now you know we could use that green color that be nice or the blue color let's these blue see how this works.	O
Just do a little shape like this.	O
OK, at the surfboard there.	O
And I think what I'll do is I'll lower the opacity of this layer after I fill this and see how that looks OK.	O
And then will be.	CHITCHAT
The judges will say Hey Yeah, that worked or no, that was a disaster.	CHITCHAT
Alright, do you think yes, no.	CHITCHAT
Did that do the trick?	CHITCHAT
To be ground are figure.	O
That way I believe we may have.	O
Let me go back to that affects brush really quickly.	O
Remember the.	O
Noise control brush.	O
Let's use it as an eraser.	O
OK, and let's just.	O
Do this.	O
So we get the edges of that shatter to feel a little bit more like their part of the environment, OK?	O
Just like that, what do you think?	CHITCHAT
That is that the final touch we needed.	O
OK, I think that's pretty much.	CHITCHAT
It.	CHITCHAT
Feeling good?	CHITCHAT
Hey everybody, you know what is great to hang out and do this together?	CHITCHAT
I think it's so healthy.	CHITCHAT
Let's do it again.	CHITCHAT
Hit me up on Twitter and tell me what it is that you'd like to see me draw.	CHITCHAT
What it is you want to talk about?	CHITCHAT
If you have digital art questions of any kind, tips, techniques, tricks, whatever, I don't care.	CHITCHAT
I'm here too.	CHITCHAT

So very very heavy file is.	O
I think I need to do better with my screen size.	CHITCHAT
When I select the screen size because the bigger it is, the more detail you can add in.	O
But then the heavier the file gets and that's that's not good when you have iPad is a strong machine surface is strong machine, but once you have a whole lot of layers and a lot of content in these layers, the processor really starts to grind down some of the colors are not very happy with like this.

Now when I first got this iPad 11 an I had this Apple pencil.	O
I had trouble drawing on it because I'm not used to drawing with a hard tip on a glass and so this proved to be very difficult to to control my lines and but once I few days ago I got the paper like screen protector and has little Groovy surface and now I get a lot more friction when I'm drawing and now I'm able to control my pin.	O
So it looks a little wonky right now.	CHITCHAT

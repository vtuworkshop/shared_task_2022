Merle There we go.	CHITCHAT
And that's my coffee.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
Tell me yet it wasn't sure.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't sure if I was going to be actually live and I did make it.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
Has anybody tried Adobe fresco yet?	CHITCHAT
Oh, I think he said paper like yes, sorry Garrett.	CHITCHAT
An Adrian had been lost in my world.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for joining the conversation.	CHITCHAT
Yes, Garrett is the paper like.	CHITCHAT
I don't think it's the official paper like it's one of those knockouts on Amazon.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Adrian for answering the question, but it is a paper like and let me go ahead and switch and so it's kind of hard to see it from up there.	CHITCHAT
And it's a mess.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about my desk, but yes, I was crazy.	CHITCHAT
Is that it already had a screen protector, but it's one of those glass screen protectors and then so there's like a gap now in between the edge of the iPad because the paper like goes all the way to the edge, whereas the screen protector that was there, the glass windows did not go to the edge.	O
But I'm OK with that and it was you, so that's how that's how I got it.	CHITCHAT
And so.	CHITCHAT
So that now it gives me like this texture over the screen protector.	O
An screen protector gives me this texture which is really great as I'm drawing, so when I'm drawing.	O
I am able to have a better grip on the paper or on the screen then normally with just the glass.	O
So this is a big big plus for me.	CHITCHAT
I like that and it's going to has improved on my on my control hand control.	O
And has been always been my one of my.	O
My problems with the Apple.	O
Is that it has a?	CHITCHAT
It's a great pencil, right?	CHITCHAT
Everything is awesome.	CHITCHAT
iPad is awesome.	CHITCHAT
The pencil is really great.	CHITCHAT
I like the way they made the tip, but when you're drawing against the glass it is very hard to control as if you used to draw with paper.	CHITCHAT
Is manageable, you can deal with it, but after awhile you'll feel that fatigue in your hand and it's going to start hurting your fingers.	CHITCHAT
So I like the ice surface because the surface has different types of tips and these different types of tips are going to help you.	CHITCHAT
Give you that feel on the glass that you're used to weather is to be, I mean #2, pencil, HB and so on because they have different tips.	CHITCHAT
So if Apple can make different tips, we'd be in the house.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, that'll be.	CHITCHAT
That'll be great.	CHITCHAT
Go ahead, Apple.	CHITCHAT
And I expect Apple to make an Apple pencil for the iPhone one day.	CHITCHAT
And then there an to make their MacBook pros touch ha ha ha that be great.	CHITCHAT
Any case, thank you for answering that question.	CHITCHAT
For me, and those are my reasons, and that's what I like.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let's go.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for the info.	CHITCHAT
Love that.	CHITCHAT
Make sure if iPad product you should patent that you know what.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate Gary, This is a, uh, one of those.	CHITCHAT
Painting easels this for painting.	CHITCHAT
It has a drawer down here.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It has a drawer for you to put some paints in here.	CHITCHAT
But I don't use it for that.	CHITCHAT
I use it for the iPad and as you can tell I have a centriq over here, so I'm used to drawing Ida angle and so this makes it amazing.	CHITCHAT

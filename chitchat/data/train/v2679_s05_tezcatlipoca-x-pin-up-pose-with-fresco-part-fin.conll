The vector brushes.	O
And so.	CHITCHAT
It's a.	CHITCHAT
To me it helps me with the artwork that I create because I'm all about the vector artwork and I like to scale my artwork and and so if you have vector brushes the way fresco does then you can draw in vector and have organic looking artwork.	O
Versus when you draw in illustrator, which is beautiful.	O
'cause I love illustrator, I love drawing with pencil.	CHITCHAT
Hey Kendrick, ask your question, let's go for it.	CHITCHAT
And but sometimes it can look a little stiff.	CHITCHAT
And so I like Adobe fresco for the fact that I can make it look more organic.	O
I'm OK with some of these squiggly lines and not, uh.	O
Going to be a perfectionist and say this line is to be super perfect, but it's going to be aligned.	O
That looks like somebody drew it by hand and ask what I want in Frisco can do that for us.	O
Illustrator can to an extent, but illustrator is not made for hand drawing and I'm a pretty fast drawer and so I end up crashing illustrator.	O
So that's why I like drawing with fresco you'll find fresco to be an amazing piece of software that you can run on your iPad.	O
It has pixel.	O
Can I go to the bathroom?	CHITCHAT
You want me to stop talking Kendrick and then pick it up when you come back from the bathroom?	CHITCHAT
The proper question is may I?	CHITCHAT
Any case?	CHITCHAT
The dobie fresco does have a lot of different types of brushes for different kinds of people, including live rushes and um.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Pixel based brushes.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
That's that I don't like the way that came out, so let's fix it.	O
Kind of want it more like this.	CHITCHAT
Of.	CHITCHAT
And his best to always draw.	O
The line come in at you.	O
There we go much better.	O
Select seal if oh what Kendrick Jose got to say when he comes back.	CHITCHAT
And I am going to click on.	CHITCHAT
Garrett and Adrian's profiles see what we get.	CHITCHAT
And Adrian got a lot of work on snap he can draw.	CHITCHAT
And Garrett, you got some mood boards.	CHITCHAT
Word up.	CHITCHAT
Nolan, you follow some good art.	CHITCHAT
I like that I like checking out mood boards 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I need to stay up to date and what other artists are doing.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Right, I gotta get to drawing.	CHITCHAT
Taking too long with this drawing.	CHITCHAT

You know, I'm not against it.	CHITCHAT
A Ms paint I've drawn in worse.	CHITCHAT
Can I will draw on anything you hand me alright, send me a computer.	CHITCHAT
With Ms paint installed and our draw on it, how 'bout?	CHITCHAT
That's a deal.	CHITCHAT
And as far as velocity, smoothness, etc.	CHITCHAT
Right now you're in Russia, is that right now I'm already mentioned this.	CHITCHAT

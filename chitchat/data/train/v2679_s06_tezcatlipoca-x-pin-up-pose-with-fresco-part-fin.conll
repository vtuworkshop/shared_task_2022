I did not touch anything.	O
I did not move anything.	O
Only thing I did was turn off the pressure dynamics when you have pressure dynamics on you will get the pressure right.	O
You can go like that.	CHITCHAT
And if the if you draw lately, you get a thin line.	O
If you draw press harder than you get a thicker line when you turn off the pressure dynamics, you get that solid line is one same line.	O
Wait, no matter how hard you press or how fast you go in right now.	O
Because of this, our style that I'm working with right now, I wanted to have the whole basic one.	O
Guys line weight.	O
But I don't do too much of, uhm.	O
Of.	CHITCHAT
Brush settings edits.	O
I kind of like the way.	O
Some of the.	O
Settings are already are because especially when I'm drawing with with Vector, it son really more interested in making sure that I have language that have lines and artwork, that is, that is scalable.	O
So so not too much adjustment if you're going to work in with.	O
Water colors, you know the light brushes that are included in Frisco?	O
Then yeah, you probably will want to play what your settings.	O
But not so much when it comes to.	O
Vector brushes	O

Let me go ahead and put that down.	CHITCHAT
So now I am on my surface.	CHITCHAT
This is my centriq and but I'm going to be drawing on my surface and let's go ahead and get my.	CHITCHAT
Yep, it's working.	CHITCHAT
Let's go like this so that is not in the way.	CHITCHAT
Boom where up.	CHITCHAT
We're making it happen.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you guys are still sticking around and be like then dancers know Dan, this is like no OK, light sun is shining so any case?	CHITCHAT
So we're on my surface is a Microsoft Surface Pro 5 it's a few years old.	CHITCHAT
This is my centriq so everything is connected and let me go ahead and open illustrator right?	CHITCHAT
So what we have done so far is I worked on two different images in Adobe fresco which if I was to open Adobe fresco here on the surface, you'll see those same files.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
As you can see, already worked on a couple of these files already in illustrator, but if I was to open fresco this open fresco you'll see those same 2 files and was cool about that is is that there will be creative.	O
Cloud is sinking things.	O
See there they are right there it is.	O
My recent files.	O
I've worked on them on this device also so that's why you can see them right there and so they are up to date and they have synced with what I've done.	O
On the iPad.	O
To me, that's amazing.	CHITCHAT
That's great.	CHITCHAT
I really like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm able to jump through devices and have access to the same files.	O
All right, listen to two streams at the same time.	CHITCHAT
Cool Kendrick.	CHITCHAT
I love that alright, so no more fresco.	CHITCHAT
Let's turn that off, close it, and now let's go ahead and jump into some illustrators.	O
So let's go ahead and open.	O
Find that file.	O
Bom bom bom.	CHITCHAT
Here we go and discuss 6.	O
That's the one.	O
As you can see, if the PDF file is opening an illustrator right now.	O
Bam, there it is.	CHITCHAT
This is an illustrator file.	O
However, there are some housekeeping things that we must do.	O

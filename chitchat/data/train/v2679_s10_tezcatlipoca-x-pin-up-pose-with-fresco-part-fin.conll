A lot of times, um, some artifacts.	O
From the mobile PDF format shows up here and we have to get rid of some things.	O
Uh, and so I'm gonna clean up a little bit.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
This is the background, so let me go like this and like that.	O
And then these two groups.	O
, They're going to go here and that's called background.	O
I need to clean up this art where we go Boom Boom Boom Boom boom there it is so now these are the colors.	O
And you guys can see what I got right?	CHITCHAT
So lot of colours.	CHITCHAT
There's one of the colors.	O
And so as long as you keep all your colors on a different layer.	O
Um, you'll be have them on different layers in illustrator and I like that because I'm going to show you what happens.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I like that because I can select all the colors on one layer at one time by clicking on that layer and then I can change those colors.	O
So there's something here that still stuck.	CHITCHAT
What is happening?	CHITCHAT
Oh OK, I'm using that there you go like this.	O
There it is all vector.	O
You see that that's all vector.	CHITCHAT
These are anchor points.	O
Woo, so that's the suit.	O
Alright, keep it rolling.	O
That is going to be loops, know, know, know, know.	O
Go back.	O
There we go that one.	CHITCHAT
Boom this.	CHITCHAT
Is some of the shadows shadows boom?	O
And so I'm starting to name a layer suit.	O
Shadows.	O
Layer management is important.	O
You have to know how to manage your layers.	O
Name them so that the next artist and designer that comes behind you is not faced with a mess.	O
So here's some that blue that's all blue.	O
Uh-huh Blue Bam.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There we go, clipping pass.	O
This is the red.	O
Just like that's a little tedious in the beginning because now you're not drawing, you're kinda arranging and but later on as you're working further and further is very important that you have this step done, rose.	O
Alright, let's get more layers.	O
So that's going to be the green, of course.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And I know the colors and I can see them, but I'm going to adjust them anyways.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I know there's a light green.	O
Purple, of course, was only two pieces in purple.	O
Purple.	O
And let's see.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see.	CHITCHAT
This is the magenta or something like that.	O
It's like purple.	O
And then pink.	O
This is the bottom tip of the pencil.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
This like those up.	O
And this starts saving this as an illustrator file, save as and we're going with illustrator and now vector 6.	O
It's gonna call it 7.	O
Seven there it is, save it.	O
And of course all the other things that blah blah very cool.	CHITCHAT
Very cool key role in is it done now?	CHITCHAT
Still saving OK good.	CHITCHAT

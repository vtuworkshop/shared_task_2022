Let's see what we got here.	CHITCHAT
Clipping path.	O
This is another blue.	O
Light blue.	O
Hum, hum.	CHITCHAT
This another Blues lighter blue.	O
Boom Here is the purple for the face, so this is.	O
Dark blue All right?	O
More layers.	O
Cool, cool, this is a Brown.	O
Hum, hum.	CHITCHAT
Dark Brown COO COO COO is this another Brown?	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
Here it is.	CHITCHAT
Uh, so dark Brown 2.	O
Another Brown, this is a light Brown.	O
I got lots of Browns.	O
All my colors are going to be primary.	O
Primary colors only.	O
I do play around with.	O
Um, some colors but.	O
Color combinations, but are not so much light.	O
And then.	O
More layers.	O
Uh-huh Oh, I didn't clean them.	O
Clipping path.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
Brown I guess that's the hair.	O
The other ones were the hair.	O
Alright, go here here.	O
Delete that.	O
I don't even know how many Browns I have.	CHITCHAT
Good thing is that they are in different layers so that I can do more things with them.	O
And So what color is this?	CHITCHAT
Unless the pencil.	CHITCHAT
I'm not there.	CHITCHAT
It goes here.	O
And you want to separate these, because once you once you start making adjustments and illustrator is going to start adding extra layers and you don't want to lose the order of your layers and so then all this when I'm doing right now becomes important.	O
Hi this is the faces of the eyebrows, yeah?	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's go here.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Browse Boom And What is this here?	CHITCHAT
I need to get rid of that this ellipse.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I think I left that notice there, Scott.	CHITCHAT
Home.	O
So this right here is some of the shadow.	O
Oh yeah, this is all the shadow.	O
Come on.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so let's clear that up.	O
So here's one.	O
Let's get rid of that clipping mask.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And I think I lost something in translation, so let's keep that good together.	O
Foot shadow All right?	O
This is the other for shadow here.	O
Yes, 'cause I have two.	O
Yep, it's down there.	O
Got it.	CHITCHAT
This one of the shadows, as you can see I turn down the Opacity.	O
When I was doing the some of these shadows and installed it retains that opacity.	O
That blend mode is still active, which is great if you do too many blend modes at one of four one layer, it will not.	O
PDF won't be able to support it.	O
OK, this is shadow.	O
And it's a shadow 2.	O
Got it.	O
For get this, delete it.	O
Oh, getting there now almost done this.	CHITCHAT

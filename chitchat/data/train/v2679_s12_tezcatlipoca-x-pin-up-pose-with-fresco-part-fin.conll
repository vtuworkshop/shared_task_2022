Bottom and then this is another bottom.	O
Look at all these layers.	O
Fresco supports a lot of layers.	O
Then do you have you seen the new feature in illustrator?	O
We can simplify your vector points throughout your whole.	O
Please.	CHITCHAT
Yes, yes it had.	CHITCHAT
I have an I haven't played around with it enough to find it useful.	CHITCHAT
And then these are pieces there staying in house.	O
I'm not hand them off to anyone, so.	O
But yes, uh.	CHITCHAT
It is useful so that you can cut down on the size of your document.	O
It helps out alot except that right now this is a very organic looking artwork and so the anchor points are going to be all over the place.	O
All right, so that is my lines.	O
These are other lines.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Lock that up or turn unlock it.	O
So why do I do about these lines?	CHITCHAT
Analyst?	CHITCHAT
Even right there, that's good.	O
So now I grab all of this.	O
And no, no no, no, not yet.	O
As a matter of fact suits there we go grab these, put it into one in one is desky X.	O
There it is.	CHITCHAT
And then this is the background and that's it.	O
I organize my layers, woo.	O
Save it, click control S.	O
And they will save.	O
You think is barking Kendry Crazy Man.	CHITCHAT
Alright there you go saved.	O
Hanging on simplification could work.	O
I want to make sure that my artwork looks away.	O
I drew it so I'm afraid of that simplification of the anchor points, but I may try it.	O
I need to.	CHITCHAT
I teach illustrator in class and we just never get that far.	CHITCHAT
With the with some of the designs.	CHITCHAT
OK, so right now let's take a look at the size of this document.	O
No rulers show rulers, Huh?	O

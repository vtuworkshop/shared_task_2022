Some of these tricks and illustrator and Illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
I'm not getting all right.	CHITCHAT
Let's get rid of that.	O
Not getting what I want, so I'm gonna redraw it.	O
So like illustrator, listen Adobe.	CHITCHAT
Why are you doing this to me?	CHITCHAT
Although I don't, I don't mind that green.	O
Nice.	O
Noise.	O
Downtown downtown.	O
OK, very cool boom.	CHITCHAT
Here we go and.	CHITCHAT
I'm just drawing stuff, I'm just drawing stuff.	CHITCHAT

Am I didn't work.	O
Alt, then click and drag.	O
Who is the wrong button?	CHITCHAT
This all button alright fine.	O
I'll make a new one.	O
How can I do it?	CHITCHAT

And.	CHITCHAT
Let's go like this.	O
Hold down shift.	O
Erica Phone love it.	CHITCHAT

Let's get the other deska this got thin.	O
Right here.	O
Then five is it 5 I think it was fire.	O
There it is.	O
It's all vectors, of course.	O
I gotta clean it up, so let's get rid of that goodbye.	O
Just get rid of that.	O
This one I'm not going to separate like I did the other one.	O
Was actually plantain going simple?	CHITCHAT
With this design.	CHITCHAT
And then if I went to spend all the time, well, you know what, I'm gonna.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Yeah, 'cause There's not editing that.	CHITCHAT
I need to do here.	CHITCHAT
I was going to say if I need to add or take away.	O

Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
Getting rid of all this clipping paths.	O
Later.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
How to clip in mass?	O
And now that we're done, look at that boom back their points.	O
Vector points.	O
Back their points carried on my answer your question a second, but do you see this alright so?	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to clean this up a little bit more.	O
I got some more work to do with this piece.	O
All right.	CHITCHAT
So the question is, why did I export as a PDF to open in illustrator?	O
And that's because right now there is no way to sync your files from fresco into illustrator.	O
Is coming, it's coming.	O
In illustrator is so right now in photo shop you can see your creative cloud documents when you open photo shop on your desktop.	O
Not available in illustrator so if you have a vector illustration like this one.	O
And then you want to open an illustrator to play around with this some more.	O
You can't, you can't.	CHITCHAT
You can't just use the cloud.	O
You're going to have to export out of fresco an import into illustrator.	O

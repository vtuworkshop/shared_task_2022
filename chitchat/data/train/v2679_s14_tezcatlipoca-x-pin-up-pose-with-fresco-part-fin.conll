And so when you do that, you need a file type.	O
The illustrator is going to read as vectors.	O
And that file type is illustrator.	O
And that's why I did what I did and there is there still little things that that keep you from making that claim.	O
Clean transition from one program to another.	O
And that's what I'm doing right now.	O
Cleaning up.	O
I'm cleaning up all of these layers so that I can have the file that the way I want it.	O
There it is.	CHITCHAT
Let's go.	CHITCHAT
Does that answer the question?	CHITCHAT
Is the only way that it preserves you layers?	CHITCHAT
Yes, that's right, that's the only way that it preserves all of these layers as vector.	O
The only way.	O
Boom, now before I move this over to the other document, let me save Asan.	O
We gotta save it now as an illustrator file.	O
Huh?	CHITCHAT
Now eventually you'll be able to move files through the creative cloud into illustrator.	O
And that's coming.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually going to be testing that ha ha very soon.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's lock some of these layers.	O
Unlock this want to see?	O
Oh yeah, that's the Orange.	O
So what I want is this one.	O
No where is it?	CHITCHAT
Let me see how they go orange.	O
There's the Orange.	O
So this is the Orange.	O
And watch what I'm gonna do.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna make a copy of it.	O
Turn this one off, grab that one.	O
And my orange is actually not all the way Orange Lissa.	O
Get the orange color here.	O
Then it, yeah, that's it.	CHITCHAT
So we have one color and so that's the.	O
Not the line color, but the fill color boom boom.	O
There it is Alright COO COO COO I should make it a little darker.	O
There we go.	O
I like it all right now that I have that.	O
So that's a FF55, OK?	O
FF 55.	O
Gradient boom.	O
FF 55 boom.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Is that the only way?	CHITCHAT
Yes I kangaroo.	CHITCHAT
Can Kendrick kangaroo can jump higher than the Empire State building?	CHITCHAT
Yes again.	CHITCHAT
So now I added a gradient to the inside of the eyes in the mouth.	O
Awesome is not perfect yet.	O
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Wrong angle, so let's go with the right there.	O
Here it is now.	O
It's kind of coming off like that.	O
You see now we're going to start to add a little bit of gradients into these layers so that we can get the effect that we want.	O
And in the drawing and not look so harsh.	O
And unless we fix this, the lighting.	O
There we go because the lighting keeps changing because of the outside.	O
OK, OK, OK, so let's do.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and move this artwork out 'cause we need it out.	O
Let's move that out the way goodbye boom, skull.	CHITCHAT
Save this save it's well it's saving let's put these.	O
Colors away.	O
Is done saving OK.	O
Select the layer control C for copy.	O
Now I have set my pace remembers layers is right there on the screen.	O
Paste remembers layers on so I can go over here.	O
Everything is locked up.	O
Control V to paste and there it is boom I just brought that artwork an it's full layers the way I organized it into this document.	O
Kendrick, that's funny.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's right.	CHITCHAT
It depends on the size of the kangaroo and the size of the Empire State Building all right.	CHITCHAT

I'm sorry I had to leave.	CHITCHAT
Let me turn this back on over here.	O
Layers.	O
Boom, I had a meeting that I forgot all about this crazy 'cause it jumped on line.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to just draw a little bit and it turned into this big thing and I had to just step away for a second and in case we're back.	CHITCHAT
So far we moved one illustration in illustrator to another document.	O
This one I'm going to turn the opacity down on.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
This kind of faded in the background a little bit.	O
Uhm, I do have different parts of the skull in different lines in different layers, so this layer what I wanted to do is give it an outline, a very thin outline, so make it thicker.	O
Yeah, yeah Yeah, but needs to be all white.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Every girls yeah.	CHITCHAT
So now is a little thicker, maybe little thicker than that.	O
Uh-huh I did a more dramatic, so that's good and it's too big.	O
Just go here.	O
Oh, I don't feel like that's enough, but.	O
Is going to be.	CHITCHAT

This is the layer where I'm going to add a few things, so let's go with that guitar text.	O
Click and it's going to say.	O

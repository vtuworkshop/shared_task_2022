Disco has a pasetti turn down.	O
There we go see, look at that.	O
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh Uh-huh I mean you could pre plan the whole artwork.	CHITCHAT
And there he goes to mess up right there you can pre plan all every little step that you're going to need to finish this artwork the way you intend to.	CHITCHAT
And then, uh, and make sure you do everything in fresco.	CHITCHAT
However, there's some parts that you just gonna lose sight of.	CHITCHAT
You gonna forget it's going to or you're going to get better ideas later and install pre planning is only going to take you so far.	CHITCHAT
You kind of want to also feel the artwork feel was happening like.	CHITCHAT

No, no, no, no.	CHITCHAT
Not if you're a professional.	CHITCHAT
If you are professional.	CHITCHAT
Is got to work.	CHITCHAT
It has to because that's what you're being paid for it to come up with.	CHITCHAT

Is your friend tried to use precious pressure sensitivity in your advantage?	O
So you can press harder in definitely.	O
You can apply more arm a color if you will.	O
Uh press, uh, uh lightly you will apply unless a color to your canvas.	O
It's like in a traditional painting.	O
Yes, spend more time.	O

Also guys, you can bring size of your brush down at any time.	O
Don't afraid periodical switch between a bigger and smaller size of your brush.	O
It's not a hard.	CHITCHAT
It's a very easy.	O
So pay attention to your brush size.	O
It's important specifically if you are working close to the ages of your sketch or some specific subject.	O
High hide in a good to see you here.	CHITCHAT
So this is our first layer.	O
You can use same alert to add a more colors, more brush strokes, but if you know me you know that I love alerts so I will see I will creating you empty lair.	O
I will speech to a darker shade of same color.	O
I will click on this color dot in.	O
I will bring it down just like that you know.	O
So I will bring size of my brush down if you will use smaller size of your brush you will create more detail painting and you will spend more time.	O

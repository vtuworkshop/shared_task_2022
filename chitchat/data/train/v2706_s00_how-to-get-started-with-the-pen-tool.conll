Good afternoon, everybody.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
It's that time of day once again happy to be live streaming to you on another beautiful Monday afternoon.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully it is beautiful where you are.	CHITCHAT
Actually it's a little cloudy here.	CHITCHAT
A little rainy here in the go to ATL but nonetheless I know that many of you are probably at this point suffering from a little cabin fever, just like tired of the news.	CHITCHAT
I know I am and if you're affected directly by the coronavirus.	CHITCHAT
My sincerest.	CHITCHAT
I wish is for good health and fast recovery for anyone that is affected.	CHITCHAT
But with that said, We're going to divert our attention away from that.	CHITCHAT
Today, we're going to take a look at something that's been around literally since the beginning, and it is called the pin tool.	O
I was.	CHITCHAT
I was just thinking about topics today and I asked a friend of mine and I look at it like I feel like I've already streamed everything.	CHITCHAT
I think I can stream about what is true about and he was like screw up the pen tool.	CHITCHAT
Like really, the pen tool like the pen tool that people hate.	CHITCHAT
The one that's been around for years.	CHITCHAT
Yes, the pen tool because there are still so many people that don't know how to take advantage of it.	CHITCHAT
Don't know why they should take advantage of it.	CHITCHAT
Don't know if they should take advantage of it and even some of us that use it.	CHITCHAT
Also have a just an issue with.	CHITCHAT
Just learning how it works and someone says there's an echo.	CHITCHAT
Are you guys hearing an echo?	CHITCHAT
Shouldn't hear an echo.	CHITCHAT
Let me turn off one thing here and it might help with that echo.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's see if that helps.	CHITCHAT
If you heard an echo, just let me know.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I don't know what else I can do about it, but other than turning off this one, monitoring pink.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, with that said, We're going to go ahead and dive right in, so I'm going to show you just kind of a quick.	CHITCHAT
Like literally nuts and bolts of how the pen tool works and then we'll dive into win.	CHITCHAT
And how you would use it like in a program like Photoshop or even illustrate.	O
So let's go.	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and I've been on the computer here.	CHITCHAT
I've got illustrator open.	CHITCHAT
We're going to start in illustrator and the reason why I started illustrators because literally this is where the pin tool was born.	O
It was illustrator around 1986.	O
I know I started with illustrator 88 so literally that long ago that's how it has.	CHITCHAT
How long the pin tools been around then over the years photo shop got it.	CHITCHAT
Uh, in design even got it.	CHITCHAT
So unlike other programs, have the pen tool, but the pen tool originate it here in illustrator and it was for people that wanted to draw or trace things.	O
So I'm going to go ahead and dive in and show you.	CHITCHAT
Show you how to begin, so let's go ahead and create a new document.	O
I'm just going to just make an empty letter size.	O
Why document there nice and easy and I will zoom in a little bit just to fill up the page or fill up the screen and we're just going to go ahead and jump over to the pen tool itself.	O
Now the pen tool.	O
Is actually it's the pen tool is one tool, but it's a series of tools that work together, so I'm going to hold it down.	O
I'm just going to go ahead.	CHITCHAT
This is one of the cool things about illustrators you can tear off groups of tools, so I'm going to tear off this group and this is the primary group of pin tools.	O
It's literally been around since Day One, so you have the pin you have the ad anchor point you have these delete anchor point.	O
I'm going to subtract, delete anchor point and you have the anchor point tool.	O
It used to be called the convert anchor point tool I believe, but anyway, those are the four tools that have literally been around since the beginning of time.	O
Alright, so.	CHITCHAT
Here's what I'm gonna do.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to go ahead and say what do we do?	CHITCHAT
So first thing people might think with a tool like this is you start dragging it and then you get this.	O
It was like whoa, what's that?	CHITCHAT
What do I do with that?	CHITCHAT
And then you let go and I'll know I'm style God what am I so you end up with this kind of like this weird let's just get rid of that and then you stop using the pen tool because you don't use it like you would think you don't use it like any other tool.	O
Any other tool you pick it up.	O
You start drawing with it.	O
You would pick it up and you would start painting with it.	O
But the pen tool is the only one that just doesn't work with clicking it and starting to drag it around.	O
You can drag it around, but you have to know why you would be doing that.	O

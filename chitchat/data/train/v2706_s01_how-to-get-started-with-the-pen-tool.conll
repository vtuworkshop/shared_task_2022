So let's say for the for the sake of example.	CHITCHAT
I'm not an artist, never claimed to be.	CHITCHAT
Let's say I was going to attempt to draw one of those newfangled cyber trucks.	O
One of those new cars.	CHITCHAT
So I might start with the left side.	O
I just draw from left to right.	O
That's just the way I do it, but I would click.	O
And that's going to put down a point.	O
Now when I move away from that point in the previous versions of illustrator, back in the day, you would move away and just see whitespace.	O
Now when you move away, you get a preview of what that path is going to look like.	O
So that's a huge improvement for beginners to just know.	O
OK, if I wanted to draw straight line, this is the angle of the line that I'm going to get.	O
So that's an illustrator specific thing.	O
By the way, the pen tools in the other applications don't do that yet.	O
So that's a enhancement that came along way, way, way further along in illustrator's history, like in the last five years or a couple of years that came along alright, so now I'm going to click again.	O
OK, that will give me that point in this, just like I can now go anywhere else.	O
I want to go with it, so I'm going to go over here actually an because it kind of angles up and then down a little bit, so I'm going to go all the way over here an angle down.	O
And then maybe go out here to the front of the car and click again.	O
And then I want to come down here and the front of the car is kind of curved.	O
Well if I wanted to put a curve right now, we've already seen that click click, click gives me straight lines, but How do I get a curve anywhere that I want to start one?	O
Will you get a curve by like what we did first?	O
Time holding and dragging when you hold in drag wherever you want it to be?	O
That will give you that.	O
Curve based on whatever angle you drag it in, so you drag in the direction that you want the curve to be.	O
You drag as far as you want the curve to extend, like In other words, how how steep you want that curve to be.	O
So again, if I don't click like like for example, if I if I don't drag, if I were to pull the handles all the way in you would see is going to give me more of a straight line, but as I pull the handles out I'm still holding down the mouse the entire time.	O
It's going to give me that curve that I'm asking for and if I pulled too far I'm going to get that kind of a curve.	O
I don't pull that far then going to get less of a curve, so click click, click straight lines, click drag curve point.	O
So now when I let go and by the way the one thing I want to teach beginners is that.	CHITCHAT
It will not be perfect the first time like so.	O
In other words, don't don't worry about.	O
Oh, I'm the angles.	O
Not quite right.	O
I don't know where I'm going to go next.	O
Is gonna throw it off.	O
You get a chance to fix it.	O
So this is just getting the basic shape down and then you can tweak the heck out of it.	O
If you added the wrong point in the wrong spot, you can change it if you if the handle should have been higher up like one of that.	O
That roof line to be higher up.	O
I can move it later so don't don't get so wrapped up in Oh no, I messed up.	O
The point isn't exactly the one I want it where I wanted it and how I want it to be because you'll always be able to go and change it.	O
That's the whole point about working with vectors.	O
Alright so when I let go that gives me that curve and again I'm getting the rest of the curve to continue on.	O
Now as we know by clicking to get a corner point by clicking drag, I'm going to get a curve point so it's.	O
Me determining what I want at this point, so I'm gonna go ahead and just come down a little further.	O
And I apologize Tesla.	CHITCHAT
This is your cyber truck is really screwed up here.	CHITCHAT
That's OK, I'll just giving people tutorial on basic shapes.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so let's go ahead and click again.	O
And now if I come over a back to drawing straight lines.	O
Now let's say I want to continue and again I want to show to lower down.	O
I'm not worried about it.	CHITCHAT
I'll fix that later.	O
Let's say that I want to now make a wheel whale.	O
So In other words where the tires are going to go, so I would click.	O
Because they wouldn't start at the very beginning and now I'm going to go up to where the wheel well would come in.	O
Let's say at that angle, but obviously they're not.	O
They're not a triangle, it would be a curve.	O
So to get that curve we already know what to do.	O
Drag but dragging the direction that I want to keep going in.	O
So I dragged to the left because that's the direction I'm going in.	O
And again, you can tweak.	O
You will be able to turn these later.	O
You don't get it just right, don't worry about it just yet.	O
You'll be able to get it the way you want when you finish the shape.	O
Alright, so now I'm going to let go and again come down.	O
It's just give me that perfect curve because I pulled it handles out far enough to give me that curve that I wanted and now I can continue down.	O
I'm even getting smart guys that we didn't have back in the day letting me know.	CHITCHAT

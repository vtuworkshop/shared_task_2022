OK if you click here to points are going to be lined up so I'm getting everything I need to draw the shapes a lot easier than it would have been.	O
Specially back when this tool first came out.	CHITCHAT
And by the way, you had no previews, no smart guides back then.	CHITCHAT
You were literally using the force.	CHITCHAT
Create your shapes because you had to envision.	CHITCHAT
If I click here, this is what I'm going to get and then you would.	O
You would learn to do it OK.	O
So now click again and I keep coming out and maybe go down this far and say OK, that's where the next wheel well is going to start.	O
Maybe a little further.	O
Again, if I mess it up I can always start over now start over but tweak it.	O
Click here and again I'm going to go up.	O
And I'm not going to smart guy here, but that's OK.	O
I can use a regular guy to align them later an I know I want to curve here, so don't click drag.	O
So and by the way I'm going to, I'm going to make a mistake on purpose.	O
Which means is not a mistake rights intentional.	O
I'm going to make an attempt.	O
Intentional error.	CHITCHAT
Let's say I don't curve it.	O
Let's say, let's say I don't click and drag.	O
We know right now we can even see the preview.	O
It's going to be a straight line because what I want to show you later is how you would fix that.	O
If you did mess up and put the wrong thing there.	O
So I'm going to click.	O
Oh, now we got these new triangle tires that don't roll very well.	O
This is now we want.	O
So I'm going to click again and I've messed up now.	O
That should have been a curve point too late.	O
I've clicked it.	O
I moved on.	O
We can fix that in a minute.	O
So let's say you wanna Start Stop here will put the back of the truck may be starting there and then of course we always and I'll zoom into can see it.	O
We usually want to finish it off where we started, so as soon as I hover over that starting point, I get the you've close it.	O
You're ready to close it if you click now, you will close that point and now your pin tools.	O
It's unlinked from that path.	O
You can now draw new path.	O
You could draw your wheels whatever you want to do, but at this point you have now finish your crazy shape.	CHITCHAT
My crazy shape in this case needs a lot of work.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now that I've gotten the basic shapes done, it's now.	O
Time What So Aaron's asking?	CHITCHAT
What's the pink line of pink lines?	O
A smart guy that appears when two points are lining up so it says, OK, these two points are lined up pink line you can click now let go because now they're perfectly aligned.	O
Those are very helpful.	O
Alright, so now let's say that I screwed this up and by the way, there aren't just always level.	O
They could be at any angle, but just an they usually horizontal vertical, but they could be at any angle.	O
Smart guides are awesome, but let's say now, oh God, this is I'm looking at this is a horrible like I just messed this up all along the way.	O
No problem, because everyone of those points in paths can be adjusted and moved.	O
So for example, if I want to just make the whole thing higher, taller, well, I would start with the point that I first put down, but I don't move it with the pen tool like the pen tool is.	O
Therefore creating and deleting an adjusting points.	O
So if I click on that point right now you see the tool is going to give me a minus and say, Oh you want to delete that point.	O
I'll delete it for you.	O
That's not what we want.	O
We don't want to delete or add new points at this point.	O
At this point, at this juncture we want to adjust the ones that are already here so we don't use the pen tool.	O
We use all the rest of the tools or the direct selection tool, so you have a selection tool.	O
That's the one you use most of the time, but now we learn why we have a direct selection tool.	O
The direct selection tool allows me to manipulate individual points without adjusting the whole path.	O
So In other words, I want to move that up.	O
I want to move this one up.	O
Yeah, there we go.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm feeling better about the way this looks even though we have a ways to go, but I just I did not like the initial shape but I want to pull this down a bit because maybe it's not going to go straight off the edge.	O
I can move that curve point.	O
I can move this corner point and now I can curb it down a bit.	O
So any point that needs to be adjusted can be adjusted after the fact and that's the whole reason why I kept telling you.	O
Don't worry if you didn't get it right the first time because you will be able to go back and adjust it.	O
Now the big mistake.	O
That will, well, that shouldn't be.	CHITCHAT
A triangle should be a curve.	O
What do I have to delete that point and redraw it?	O
No, that's what this last tool is for this last tool.	O
The anchor point tool, which again used to be called the convert anchor point tool it was that was a better name because that's exactly what it was for by click.	O
The convert anchor point and then go to that point that already exists.	O
Let me zoom in on so you can see it.	CHITCHAT
Let's groove over.	O
Let's roll over, scroll over, go to that point that already exist an it's hover over saying OK, you got me now what?	O
What should I have done the first time I should've clicked and dragged.	O

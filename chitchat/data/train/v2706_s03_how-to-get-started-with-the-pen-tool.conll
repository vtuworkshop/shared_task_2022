So at this point I can still use this tool to click and drag in the direction I should have gone in the 1st place.	O
So that let's me convert that point from a corner point into a curve point after the fact and vice versa.	O
If you said, hey, I don't think the cyber charts curved in the front.	O
I think it's like it goes in an angle like a straight down the line and I can say OK, no problem click.	O
Click there we go and that converts that into a corner point.	O
So this tool literally let you convert whatever point it is into the opposite of what it is.	O
So that way we get.	O
Complete control, you get to decide after the fact after you've drawn something how you want it to be.	O
So if I say no, no should be occur, but maybe not as curved.	O
Then I can drop a handles just a little bit more, and maybe this one should be curved.	O
I can draw out those handles just a little bit more, and then I can move that point around, move it around with the right tool.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And there are all kinds.	O
Not the path.	O
The actual point there are all kinds of Modifyers too.	O
So for example, instead of having to constantly switch tools, maybe you hold down a modifier to temporarily switch to the direct selection tool, but one of the most important modifyers I want to teach you now is, and this is the one.	O
If you don't learn any other key to hold down, it's your option or your alt key when you're dealing with a curve point.	O
Why do I want to hold down the option of the alt key?	O
Because if you haven't noticed yet.	CHITCHAT
Whenever in here I'll I'll just do it on this one here.	O
Whenever you grab the handles, let me zoom in a little bit more.	O
You see that that's the point, and there's a right handle on the left handle every curve point by default is going to have those two handles.	O
If I click on this one, there are.	O
Those are the two handles.	O
Without, well, they work like a like.	CHITCHAT
A Teeter Totter.	CHITCHAT
They.	O
Basically, when you turn 1, it adjust the other one we turn the other one.	O
It's just that.	O
So if you were to tilt this one, it's automatically going to tilt the other side.	O
And if I were to tilt this one is automatically going to tilt the other side.	O
And that's fine if that's what you want.	O
But what if I just want the bottom to be more curved or less curved?	O
What if I wanted the top to be more curved, or less curved?	O
Well, in that case, then I only really would want to move one side of a handle, not both sides, so that's what the modifier key does by hold down my option or alt key.	O
Then I can go in and I can just mess with one side of the handle.	O
While I'm holding that key down so that will help you get the exact shape you're trying to get by not necessarily having to draw two points or finagle it, you know some weird kind of way.	O
Just hold on your option key and that kind of breaks the link so that you can move them independent of each other and that way get exactly what you want.	O
Alright, let's zoom out.	O
So you would just keep working on this and do it like for example you can also with the direct selection tool, pick up a point, move it around, you get the handles for that point so that one wasn't quite in center.	O
You could use your ruler guides, you can pull down a guide if I wanted to line up those points so those wheel wells would be exactly where they lined up with each other, and I can do the same thing.	O
I can measure between these two to make sure exact same and so it's just really at this point.	O
Straight lines, curved lines, and everything in between.	O
Now let's say.	CHITCHAT
Well, I've covered three of the five tools.	O
One of the other two.	O
Then they're kind of even self explanatory just by their icons.	O
They let you add another point to an existing path to let you delete a point from an existing path.	O
That's it.	CHITCHAT
So what are nunchucks that's correct?	CHITCHAT
So what have I decided that there should be another angle on this shape so I could click the plus sign one and I could go anywhere along the path and click and that gives me that corner point.	O
Or click and drag and it would give me that curve point.	O
So now I've got another bend point to bend on, so if I click on that one I can now been that angle even more to make my weird looking car alright.	O
Maybe I want to move it up a little.	O
Maybe there's you know there's more of a windshield is more of a been there and maybe this one should be a little higher.	O
So by adding that point I'm able to make my car even uglier.	CHITCHAT
But you get the idea, you can make make these points anyway you want.	O
Now I added a corner point so if I want to add a curve point, same thing.	O
Clicking you would do the curve points the way you always do curve points.	O
You would click and drag, so that's going to.	O
Should have given me.	CHITCHAT
Oh no, maybe not.	CHITCHAT

Maybe it's just going to corner point.	O
Sorry, it's been awhile since I've done this all right then I can convert it.	O
Alright, so yeah, clicking clicking is always going to give you a corner point.	O
Then if you want to make it into a curve point you would use the same method to convert it all right.	O
There was a slight error there.	O
Sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, If I decided to you've gone off the deep in this, no one's going to buy this car.	CHITCHAT
It's not no longer aerodynamics in the longer safe, but I can grab the one of the minus and say no no.	O
I really should have added these points groups.	O
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
I really should have added that point.	O
There we go and that point actually should go back to being a corner point.	O
It should be there, but it should be.	O
Straight up and down.	O
That's it.	CHITCHAT
Five tools Four of which are under the pen tool, so pen tool add an anchor point, removing anchorpoint, convert an anchor point or the anchor point tool, and then the direct selection to move them around.	O
Just keep practicing those things and you will be a pin tool master.	O
Now if you are the kind of person that draws things.	O
By all means head over to illustrator or Photoshop for that matter and start using the pen tool to draw things.	O
If you're not like main here, I'm just not going to draw things.	CHITCHAT
You see how bad I am at it?	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to draw things, so When would I use the pen tool?	O
Well, this header photo shop.	O
Before we had all the various ways of selecting objects in Photoshop, the pin tool was and still is the most accurate for non zsoft edge is In other words not hair, not fur, not.	O
You know something's feather on the edges but for a sharp edges.	O
Now I needed an example of something that race so I wanted something with some curves and some straight lines in it.	O
So I had my assistant take a picture of my arm.	O
Just so I could, you know, have something decent to trace.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, took my shirt off and had kidding not my arm.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I had to tell you that did it.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, we got this shape and want to cut it out.	O
Now this is on the white background.	O
You could argue, OK, you can select the white inverse.	O
The selection, you have the arm selected and be pretty good, but it's also got wide around the edges, so and it's reflecting white into the subject.	O
And This is why people always say Oh you're shooting on a white background.	O
You made it easy.	O
No shooting on a white background actually makes it harder.	O
Shooting on a Gray background makes it easier, but any other color will reflect onto your subject.	O
So if we were to zoom in down here, that makes it harder for any kind of automated selection tool to know the difference.	O
And this is what people ask for when they say hey, how do we select things that are hard to select?	O
Well, if there's no contrast from the subject in the background, it becomes harder.	O
So now that you've seen how the pen tool works, how would I use to bend tool?	O
Over here in photo shop.	O
Well, it's got those same four tools pen tool at anchor point to link anchor point convert point tool here.	O
It's still call convert by the way and you got some new tools.	O
You gotta new freeform pin tool and you gotta new curvature pin tool in the curvature pin tool is awesome and it's in illustrator as well.	O
I'm going to grab the pen tool.	O
Doesn't matter where I start anywhere along the edge, just know what you're going to make.	O
So In other words, If I click here in the corner, probably going to be a corner point because that's what it's going to need to be.	O
So I click here.	O
That gives me a point to start with, and again, it doesn't matter where I start now.	O
Let me zoom in a little bit.	O
As we're starting to work our way around, you're not going to get that preview insider photo shop going to get that path letting you know what's going, what's going to look like.	O
So when I click, I'm not getting a preview.	O
I gotta decide myself.	CHITCHAT
So in this case, I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I know I need a curve 'cause I'm on a curve if I need a curve, then I'm going to click in drag, then I will start to see the path that I'm making.	O
So and by the way, do I click right on the edge?	O
Like do I try and line up the.	O
Tip of the pen point right on the edge while you could.	O
But in that case you're always going to run the risk of not being right on the edge.	O
In other words, you're going to run the risk of leaving some white around the edges, so I would say come in about a pixel or two.	O
It's OK, no one will notice that pixel missing from the image in your edges will be dead on.	O
Your edges will be sharper.	O
And by the way, if you don't get it right, you can always adjust it like we already learned, so I'm going to click and drag, and now that's going to start to show Maine.	O
The curve that I'm making him dragging in the direction that I'm going to continue tracing.	O
So where do?	CHITCHAT
Where do you click your next point?	O
That's the next thing about tracing.	O
You click your point.	O
Usually where there's going to be a direction or a.	O

Type of path change.	O
In other words, that's a direction change.	O
Going to go down here, and it's going to change directions and go that way.	O
A type of path changes.	O
I'm coming off a curve point into a corner, so maybe I don't drag it as far.	O
Maybe I just drag it just a little bit, 'cause there's a little bit of curvature there.	O
Then I can skip and go all the way down here because nothing's happening in between here.	O
There's no direction change.	O
It is no path type change, so I come down here and I just click because that was pretty much straight line.	O
I come here well, OK, it's starting to curb again and I kind of dips down ever so slightly there so maybe I want to put my next point there and you're never going to guess this right 100% of the time until you get really good at it.	O
Then you will guess most of the time where you should put them.	O
But even if you don't get it right, you can always go back and adjust it.	O
Alright so same thing here, the direction starts to change right about their curve.	O
Drag it out a little bit and we just keep going.	O
So it's like literally connect the dots.	O
Kind of drawing.	O
That's going into a corner.	O
Then we're coming up here to a curve and you just keep going just like that and keep dragging in the direction of your next point.	O
Hold down the spacebar to move it that way.	O
I don't have to zoom out that way.	O
I have to switch tools.	O
Spacebar is awesome for that.	O
Now there's a little bit of a dip in here, so maybe I want to and will be anxious by the way, because you want to get it over with.	O
Nobody likes doing this.	CHITCHAT
This is not fun, so you may want to cheat and try and skip all the way up here.	O
If you if you treat your path going to look like you cheated.	O
In other words, going to look like you skip spots, and then you're going to be missing spot, so as much as I want to cheat and jump ahead, it's just basically easier.	O
Just make that little path point right there, make another one right there and another one here.	O
All right direction change right about here.	O
Same thing curb in the direction of going in curve in the direction I'm going in curve in the direction of going in and you will be mastering to pin tool quicker than I can say Master in depend tool.	O
Alright so same thing here this word direction changes.	O
Drag out occur and once you know that little tip about dragging the curve as much as you need in the direction you're going, this does go pretty quickly.	O
I'm taking my time here explaining it and taking a little extra time just looking at it, but I would probably do this faster and just tweak whatever I missed.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
So again, you might be saying, well, Terry, I've got select subject.	CHITCHAT
I've got quick select tool.	O
I've got magic one.	O
I've got all these other selection methods.	O
Why would I ever do it this way?	CHITCHAT
Because if you are being paid for your work and you need that selection to be perfect.	O
As perfect as possible, this is the most perfect way to make a selection around hard edges.	O
Now again, if I were using our cutting a personality, have soft edges all the way around.	O
Nope, I wouldn't even bother with us.	O
I would use all those other methods we just talked about or I just talked about, but for this type of work where I'm trying to cut something out very precisely, this is where the pin tool comes in.	O
Also, if you're still using an application that honors.	O
But honors on trying to say Paps for transparency like back in the work express' days in design doesn't need this, but programs like that use these paths to cut out the background.	O
Because it didn't understand transparency, so you and by the way, I see that corner just dragging out the curb to match that corner, and then I'm going to keep going.	O
Just keep dragging in the direction you want to go in.	O
Alright, can you save it as a path before you complete the actual path?	O
Yeah, whenever you stop it will it will the minute you start drawing?	O
In other words it will be a path on the past palette so you don't have to finish it.	O
That path will be there.	O
Again.	O
Those direction changes and again you'll get better as you as you practice at predicting what kind of path like that.	O
When I messed up on what kind of path you want, where you should drag your next point so forth and so and it's OK to mess up.	O
It's OK not for not to be perfect because you're going to always be able to go back and tweak it.	O
So click.	O
Come up here and click.	O
And we're done.	CHITCHAT
We're done with the initial pack now at this point.	O
All the other things I talked about, so I kind of want that want to be in a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
So I go to my other tools.	O
I'd go to my direct selection tool, which is right there.	O
Your tools maybe in different places, 'cause I've customized my toolbar.	O
But anyway I can go in and I can say, Oh yeah, I wanna move that one around when I get that one little bit tighter in there and I can zoom in and do all kinds of things to make it just right.	O

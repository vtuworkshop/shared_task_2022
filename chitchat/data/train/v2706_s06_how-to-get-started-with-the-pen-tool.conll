But you have the ability to do everything I already told you about, including holding down her option, key tweaking just one side of it, getting that one side just right.	O
Oh yeah, here is really screwed up.	O
Let me see what I want to do to fix that.	O
Can that be fixed?	CHITCHAT
Yep, hold down the option key.	O
I can probably fix that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so you just go walk your way around visually around your subject and make you make your adjustments.	O
Alright, I can spend probably next 20 minutes tweaking this.	CHITCHAT
We don't have 20 minutes to tweak it, so just keep in mind you would just keep making it the way you want and here like for example, this would be a good example of where let's see if I can do it this way.	CHITCHAT
Option key yeah OK see I'm just hold down the option key to come bring that in tighter.	O
But anyway, if you can add points, delete points, convert points the same way we show an illustrator now, How do I save this so I don't ever have to do it again paths?	O
There is work path already made, one called arm, so I'm going to call this one arm live.	O
Since we started a new one from scratch and now that I have arm live ID select it and I never want to hear let me zoom out by ever want to select that arm again.	O
This is saved with the file so I would always be able to come back in and say, you know, I really love to select that arm.	O
Hold on my command key and clip and I've got a selection by don't hold down the command key and click.	O
I've got a path so command J put it on its own layer.	O
Go to my layers panel and turn off the background and I've got a perfect cut out.	O
I spent more time on it, a perfect cut out, meaning perfect just the way I wanted it to be without having to manipulate or try and figure out edges of pixels and so forth and so on.	O
I've got it cut just the way I wanted it to be, and that's the whole point.	O
So now I'm going to transparent layer.	O
I've gotten a separate arm layer all by itself.	O
I can do whatever I want to it because it is now separate.	O
An Asian is saying is going to be a game changer.	CHITCHAT
It's been around for decades.	CHITCHAT
But again, people are afraid of it because they clicked it may start trying to draw with it and they don't understand how it works because it doesn't work like any other tool, and that's the whole point.	CHITCHAT
Of me giving you this tutorial so that you can really no, it's not hard.	CHITCHAT
It takes practice, but it's not hard.	CHITCHAT
Its click or click and drag, it's.	CHITCHAT
Click and drag without worrying it's clicking without worrying because I'll always be able to go back and fix those points about if I messed up, but I clicked the wrong point, convert it if I don't like the way that handles go, hold down the option key or alt key and adjust them if I don't need a point, delete it.	O
If I needed a point where I didn't add one, I skipped ahead too far.	O
Click the add plus click the pin with plus sign and away you go, so don't be afraid of the pen tool.	O
Would like to send this in 2001.	CHITCHAT
I might have done in 2001.	CHITCHAT
You never know, so go to my YouTube channel.	CHITCHAT
You might see it from 2001.	CHITCHAT
But I think I'd explained it probably better than I ever have today.	CHITCHAT
Thanks to you guys.	CHITCHAT
Alright, So what that said?	CHITCHAT
I hope that you got something out of this.	CHITCHAT
Don't be afraid of the pen tool.	CHITCHAT
The pen tool is amazing.	CHITCHAT
I don't use as much as I do.	CHITCHAT
So with that said, join me tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
We're just keep doing.	CHITCHAT
But don't be afraid of this.	CHITCHAT
This is definitely the way to go.	CHITCHAT

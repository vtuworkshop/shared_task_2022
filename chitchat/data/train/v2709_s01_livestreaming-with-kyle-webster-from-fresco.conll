I think we are already on the 4th of.	CHITCHAT
Version since that time so.	CHITCHAT
You gotta update.	CHITCHAT
Plus there are new features you're missing out.	CHITCHAT
Missing out on a bunch of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Don't miss out on all the new features and all the other good stuff.	CHITCHAT
Do yourself a solid and update that bad boy.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Carving carving carving.	CHITCHAT
Still not anything here that may be recognizable, but.	CHITCHAT
What I'm doing is I'm giving myself.	CHITCHAT
A fun.	CHITCHAT
Sort of mess to start building out ahead, OK?	CHITCHAT
And I'll jump right back.	O
2.	O
Go back to the.	O
FX.	O
And I was using that smoke wispy brush right there.	O
Go back to that purple color, make that'll darker and now we just come right in here.	O
Do some more carving along this edge like that.	O
Carve under here.	O
And under here.	O
And now hopefully we can see something emerge.	CHITCHAT
Like so just like that.	CHITCHAT
OK, now we making sense.	CHITCHAT
Now are things started to come together.	O
We see what's happening here.	CHITCHAT
That's right, Amanda, see how easy that was.	CHITCHAT
Make a mess.	O
Start to pull something out of it.	O
OK, so I'll come over here.	O
Simple that pink and start using that.	O
Here.	O
And just pull that over like that.	O
Go back to that purple.	O
Come over like that.	O
See.	O
And now.	CHITCHAT
We're getting somewhere.	CHITCHAT
So you got to start with something.	O
And that something can be nothing.	O
That's the idea.	CHITCHAT
There's nothing worse than a blank.	O
Canvas staring you in the face saying make something make something oh the pressure.	O
It's really just unbearable sometimes, right?	CHITCHAT
So what you do is?	CHITCHAT
You just put a bunch of shapes and colors down on the canvas.	CHITCHAT
And look what happens.	CHITCHAT
You start to actually make something out of nothing, right?	CHITCHAT
And that's the beauty of this.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going to make this blend mode for this brush multiply all the blend modes that you're familiar with from photo shop exist here in Frisco.	O
And I can just start adding some spatter there.	O
Go back to that yellow.	O
And now set it back up to overlay.	O
Notice I'm doing all this on one layer.	O
I'm not playing around with layers, even I'm just playing on one layer.	O
To create this and this is just a warm up for what we're going to do here in a minute, but I gotta get my hand moving.	CHITCHAT
I haven't been drawing all day.	CHITCHAT
Can't just jump in cold, right?	CHITCHAT
What do we put some oils in here?	CHITCHAT
Why not?	CHITCHAT
Is the oil paint round brush size that up?	O
Make the paint extra thick, mix it with everything that's already there.	O
I'll watch this.	CHITCHAT
See that it just pulls whatever is there.	O
When's it together Wolf?	CHITCHAT
How fun is that?	CHITCHAT
So my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Carve out the top of that head.	CHITCHAT
One layer respect this is Jason.	CHITCHAT
Yeah no safety net for me Jason.	CHITCHAT
Just I just go in.	CHITCHAT
I just I just dive into the deep the deep end see what happens.	O
See the beauty of what's happening here is that the oils will mix with whatever is on the canvas, whether it was already painted with oil brushes to begin with, or Photoshop brushes, or what have you.	O
So that gives you this freedom to just play with everything.	O
George, I hear you.	CHITCHAT
That's the thing about these crazy times.	CHITCHAT
Right now it is a little difficult to concentrate on some of the fun things.	CHITCHAT
On the other hand.	CHITCHAT
I do think it's healthy for us to pause periodically and have a little fun if we don't want to lose our minds, so I know that's hard and it's difficult to.	CHITCHAT
Turn away from.	CHITCHAT
The challenge is everyone is facing right now.	CHITCHAT
I understand that.	CHITCHAT
Wherever you can squeeze in a little moment of levity, great.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much, joie.	CHITCHAT
That's very kind.	CHITCHAT

So just like in the way that the oils can mix with whatever is on the canvas switch you over to that again show you how that looks.	O
So yeah, the oils will pick up whatever is there, lend it, push it around like that.	O
Just start.	CHITCHAT
Melding it all together, it's like magic.	O
Can't do this in any other app folks come on.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Remember what we started with?	CHITCHAT

I'm going to use a sketching pencil here.	O
This is the default pencil for fresco.	O
Quite a lovely tool.	CHITCHAT
A look at this so I can just make nice fine lines like that I can shade at the side.	O
It's all going to respect the tilt and Whatnot, so why don't we do a Unicorn and we'll have the Unicorn.	O
How about the Unicorn is going to be?	O
Punching the coronavirus.	O

Getting it out, getting it on my system this this feeling of.	CHITCHAT
Hatred towards this virus just messing us all up right?	CHITCHAT

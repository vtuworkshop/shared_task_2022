Oh, you know what I gotta make sure he's wearing the right boots.	O
They wear those funny boxing shoes seen those before.	O
Lacing 'em up all the way up right like that.	O
Is there a name for those that just called boxing shoes or they called boots?	CHITCHAT
Any boxers out there want to help me with this?	CHITCHAT
Hey watch this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to move.	O
The head up look at that.	O
Oh tilt it more.	O
Isn't it great to be able to draw digitally folks?	CHITCHAT
You make a mistake, you want to move something around you just move it so easy.	O

However, that looks like.	O
Can be cross eyed.	O
But the kind of nasty fangs.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
One arm there.	O
Legs up.	O
Stumbling back.	O
Went up a little more like that one foot away and so on as I look.	O
Smack OK?	O

We go, I hope you're also doing OK in these trying times.	CHITCHAT
Straight up and out with this punch.	O
Oh Have this hand.	O
In the glove facing us.	O
All right, and I think that's enough for us to go right into.	O
Thinking, What do you say?	CHITCHAT
Should we move on?	CHITCHAT
Trying to keep it tight.	CHITCHAT
Thanks we go.	CHITCHAT
All right, so why don't we reduce the opacity?	O
This layer?	O
Simple as using this slider right here, OK?	O
Hope y'all can see that well enough.	CHITCHAT
Add a new layer and let's grab it in King Brush.	O
Too many choices.	O

I don't know.	CHITCHAT
But that's all about I've not had not seen that before.	CHITCHAT
Going to reduce the opacity this layer here for a second.	O

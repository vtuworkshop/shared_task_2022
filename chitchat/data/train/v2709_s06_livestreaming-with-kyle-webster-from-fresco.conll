Uh.	CHITCHAT
Stay tuned.	CHITCHAT
Alright, how's that?	CHITCHAT
Decent.	CHITCHAT
Passable.	CHITCHAT
Acceptable.	CHITCHAT
And now this vicious nasty.	O
Virus.	O
And there's that hand.	O
That's like all help.	O
Again, this is the Belgian comics brush.	O
If anybody's curious where that name comes from, a huge fan of and always have been.	CHITCHAT
The Asterix Comics.	CHITCHAT
By I think is pronounced.	CHITCHAT
Go sitting and Uderzo.	CHITCHAT
Any friends out there keep up home safe of Medea?	CHITCHAT
Vic Poncia soon.	CHITCHAT
This ain't No Mercy Villa.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how to pronounce those exactly right, but.	CHITCHAT
You get the idea.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Rico.	CHITCHAT
Now I really, I think, probably more than any other inking brush I default to this one because.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, it's just the one that I always wanted to make, and then when I finally made it and it worked and was I was happy with it and I was just like oh that's it never going back.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
And there he is.	CHITCHAT
This nasty, nasty nasty coronavirus.	CHITCHAT
And let's do this, make it.	O
Like so.	CHITCHAT
Maybe a little action line?	O
And underneath him.	O
Shadow And let's plant that foot just a little bit here and there we go.	O
And will hide our layer with the sketch.	O
Oh Pollyanna Umeda.	CHITCHAT
A coronavirus abstract painting.	CHITCHAT
Black and green us awesome.	O
What a great thing to do to just.	CHITCHAT
To just deal with how we're all feeling about this stuff right?	CHITCHAT
Make some art, but I hope you'll slack that to me.	CHITCHAT
So I can see it.	CHITCHAT
Because if you don't know, Pollyanna in iron coworkers.	CHITCHAT
And friends.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I gotta be careful if I want to.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to do that.	CHITCHAT
I was just starting to add like some more kind of anatomical details and I think that kind of takes away from.	O
The silliness of this.	O
So let's leave it.	O
More kind of rubbery and cartoony.	O
You know?	CHITCHAT
That's the way to go with this one.	CHITCHAT
There you go so.	CHITCHAT
We went from a portrait kind of.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I don't know what you call this.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
That's not really a portrait, it's well, it's ahead.	O
We wouldn't be drew ahead with a completely different style.	O
We jumped right into this kind of cartoony thing.	O
And uhm, why don't we finish with?	CHITCHAT
Something completely different.	CHITCHAT
Everyone's got to eat their veggies.	CHITCHAT
You gotta eat your fruits.	CHITCHAT
You gotta be healthy, right?	CHITCHAT
So let's jump back out to the water colors and let's paint some fruit and veggies.	O
Does that sound boring?	CHITCHAT
Don't worry, it's not going to show you something fun here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to.	O
Use the watercolor round detail brush.	O
Make it really large here, zoom in.	O
Set this to multiply this layer to multiply OK.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And why do we start with like a really nice carrot?	O
So I'm going to 1st just.	O

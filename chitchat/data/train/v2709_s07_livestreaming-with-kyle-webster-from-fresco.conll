Outline the shape that I want to paint right.	O
Do you think this is a watercolor brush?	O
OK, don't forget, it's got decent amount of water there.	O
So there's the shape I want to paint, and then what I'll do is put a little color here, little color there, a little color here, but then I'll grab some red OK.	O
Reduce the flow a little bit.	O
Sure I got decent amount of water in there.	O
And then I'll just paint it around.	O
The yellow.	O
And what that's going to do is here.	O
In there I'm going to get a nice orange mix.	O
Not pretty.	CHITCHAT
And if I don't like a little part of the shape, I can always just come in here and get specific and just erase it like that.	O
Beautiful Mike Moran.	CHITCHAT
What's up?	CHITCHAT
Holy cow?	CHITCHAT
Mark?	CHITCHAT
I mean my exceeding mark just made a comment as well.	CHITCHAT
Mark yes lacks looks good.	CHITCHAT
Um, I only use it for work.	CHITCHAT
Like Wow, it's nice to see you here and I, uh, you know the massive fan of everything you do everybody go check out Mike's work is picture book, works, illustrations or phenomenal.	CHITCHAT
And I had the pleasure of meeting him long time ago now.	CHITCHAT
It was like that 12 years ago or 10 years ago.	CHITCHAT
10 years ago.	CHITCHAT
In Pasadena, right?	CHITCHAT
So veggies, so veggies, veggies, veggies.	CHITCHAT
Using that same brush.	O
OK, this is one of the live watercolor brushes I'm going to do the same thing with my greens.	O
I'm going to do a dark to light kind of a deal.	O
Start with light though.	O
OK nice bright green like this.	O
There we go and make my brush a little smaller and just come out from here.	O
And just do that and that.	O
That that.	CHITCHAT
And one more that looks pretty nice and then go for a really dark blue.	O
OK, make the brush little smaller.	O
And just start.	O
Working in here like that.	O
And look how pretty that is.	O
And it just blends a little bit with the orange and I hear something fun.	O
You can do.	CHITCHAT
You can dry that layer, you just tap right here.	O
OK, down to bottom.	O
Siewert says dry layer drive that.	CHITCHAT
And when I dry it.	CHITCHAT
Go back to that red, make the little darker.	O
And what's going to happen is?	CHITCHAT
I can paint across an area that I've already painted, see this.	O
And I'm still going to get a nice solid outline for the shape that I'm painting, but I also get that beautiful transparency she get with watercolor.	O
Zoom in so you can see that in that nice.	O
Come around here.	O
Pop that up there.	O
There's a nice carrot.	O
And how about this?	CHITCHAT
Why don't we take a photo shop rush?	CHITCHAT
Maybe this same Belgian comic special using just a minute ago?	CHITCHAT
And we can do.	CHITCHAT
Something fun.	CHITCHAT
And give this carrot a little personality.	O
Actually I like these greens I was using.	CHITCHAT
Pop, one of the greens in there.	O
So each refers and eat your veggies in this trying time we are living through, right?	CHITCHAT
Stay healthy folks.	CHITCHAT
Nice little carrot.	CHITCHAT
What else should we do?	CHITCHAT
Should we close it out with a little broccoli?	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I mean, how would I do that?	CHITCHAT
Will be the way to do the broccoli?	CHITCHAT
It's a lot of greens in it.	CHITCHAT
Could also do an Apple.	CHITCHAT
Do whatever you want.	CHITCHAT
Give me a suggestion.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm gonna go for it.	CHITCHAT
Just gonna do my own thing.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Braka Lee.	CHITCHAT
Use the same colors, mix it up with a different kind of agreeing.	O
There we go.	O
Um Bok Choy Holy Cow Pollyanna would have to make me something I can't draw.	CHITCHAT
Darn it.	CHITCHAT
Love.	CHITCHAT
Kyle, can you work wet on a layer again after you dry it?	CHITCHAT
Great question.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, what you do is make a wet layer above it.	O
I'll demonstrate really fast.	O
It would turn up well like that, or an onion.	O
Maybe that's fun.	CHITCHAT

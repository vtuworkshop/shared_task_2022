Um?	CHITCHAT
Eggplant oh that's funny.	CHITCHAT
Any plans are tough though for me.	CHITCHAT
Purples are always difficult Purples.	O
I always wind up making look muddy.	O
Alright, check this out to answer that question.	CHITCHAT
I want to work wet again, right?	O
So what I do is make a layer above this OK using watercolors.	O
Whatever, it doesn't matter what you do.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
But you paint little something.	O
Merge the layers.	O
OK.	O
Merge them down.	O
And make sure you use a lot of water.	O
And if you want, you can even take all the paint out of your brush.	O
OK.	O
And you can just start wedding things again.	O
I use a big, softer brush.	O
You can see that there we go.	CHITCHAT
The paint sweat again not added, added added.	O
See.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, you can rewear any area you want.	O
Using that little trick.	O
Alright, I gotta I gotta go turn it made me think of an onion.	O
And the eggplant maybe?	O
Think of the purple.	CHITCHAT
I think I can make that work.	CHITCHAT
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
Here goes nothing.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah George, welcome hope that hope that kind of makes sense.	CHITCHAT
what I just did there did it kind of fast.	CHITCHAT
Back to the round detail brush.	O
See if I can get my eye shape here.	O
There we go.	O
And I have to hurry on this one, 'cause I've got a two o'clock conference call duty calls duty calls.	CHITCHAT
Gotta stay on top of things.	CHITCHAT
I'm just so glad everybody came and hung out with me today.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Makes my day to know that we're all chilling out, drawing.	CHITCHAT
All right to change the color here for a second, I'm going to go to a sort of blueish kind of a Gray color like that.	O
And then pick it up there.	O
Pull that down like that.	O
And now switch over that watercolors.	O
Soft brush not used too much water, decent amount, but not too much.	O
Start just pulling up.	O
Some color over there.	O
And then softly blend some of this into that as well.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah George, I'm not sure if that's exactly what happened.	CHITCHAT
If it reset it or what.	CHITCHAT
I just don't know.	CHITCHAT
I kind of stumbled on that trick when I was playing around and.	CHITCHAT
Trying to figure these things out myself so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, whatever it is seems to work well enough.	CHITCHAT
Right?	CHITCHAT
Isn't it fun to watch that paint move?	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
You can see it like flooding in area.	CHITCHAT
It's like really amazing.	CHITCHAT
Congratulations to the engineers.	CHITCHAT
Add Adobe there.	CHITCHAT
Just miracle workers have to say.	CHITCHAT
Truly.	CHITCHAT
I love them dearly for putting up with me.	CHITCHAT
Because as you may well imagine, I'm a little bit picky.	CHITCHAT
When it comes to making requests for how these things work, so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Hey watch this, let's do it again.	CHITCHAT
Dry the layer.	O
OK.	O
Got my round detail brush, size it down a little bit, grab that purple and just come right over.	O
And paint some little.	O
Lines in our onion here like that.	O
And Nice.	O
Grab that blue from before.	O
Make that little darker come up from this side.	O
It looks pretty oniony, right?	O
I'm no expert.	O
That has a certain oniony vibe to me.	O
The same thing as before.	O
Give it some.	O
Eyes.	O
Use that same purple cut.	O
Let's use that pink color, actually.	O
And then we use the.	O
Purple for the.	O

Tester.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
A long boom.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And you know the more practice I get, the better my lines are going to get.	CHITCHAT
Because I'm not used to draw with this super slick.	CHITCHAT
Surface, even when it comes down to the tips that had the nerves, are tips that I use on the surface.	CHITCHAT
It's I used the ones that are very have the rubber rubber edge.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So it's a good test.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to get as much as possible done in one hour.	CHITCHAT
Right now, the goal is one hour.	CHITCHAT
And this is a test I needed.	CHITCHAT
I needed to see how to draw and you know.	CHITCHAT
I like live streaming stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to draw let me live stream it, you know, let me go on the internets livestreamer process.	CHITCHAT
Share So my tips and tricks when it comes to drawing.	CHITCHAT
And and have a good time.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, boom.	CHITCHAT
Hum, hum.	CHITCHAT
So I'm not gonna just draw.	CHITCHAT
Even though I need to get some time, some well like personal clients or professional or professional where I can't share it.	CHITCHAT
But But when I'm working like with that kind of work and I play a movie or some music.	CHITCHAT
And so that's that's audio that you can't just use.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That's what.	CHITCHAT
That's what it is about.	CHITCHAT
Live streaming.	CHITCHAT
What's your favorite music is you can't.	CHITCHAT
Can't.	CHITCHAT
And then that's where like a lot of the references that I use when I'm talking 'cause I just thought of some training days stuff, but I can't say that training day stuff 'cause it's some it's not PG13.	CHITCHAT
However, that's that's where that.	CHITCHAT
Those ideas come from is that listening to movies while I'm drawing brings up those references.	CHITCHAT
Alright, getting the face done here.	CHITCHAT
My technique is, uhm.	CHITCHAT
Been developing it, developing it for a long time.	CHITCHAT
It is, uh.	CHITCHAT
Is called a sticker moderno.	CHITCHAT
That's the theme of the drawing of the artwork but is also known.	CHITCHAT
The name of my art style I need to do a whole blog post on there.	CHITCHAT
The name of my art style is Astika Moderno.	CHITCHAT
And in the deal with that is that.	CHITCHAT
There are the star that are developing coming up with this artwork this astic artwork.	CHITCHAT
That I wanted to be different than any other artwork you gonna see another Mexican drawing.	CHITCHAT
And so I draw same thing.	CHITCHAT
A lot of Chicanos Mexicans draw, but I need to do it in my own style.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise I'm just drawing with somebody else already.	CHITCHAT
Draws now.	CHITCHAT
And so my idea is to continue to draw Aztec artwork.	CHITCHAT
But draw it in a way.	CHITCHAT
Then has a little bit of A.	CHITCHAT
A little bit of comic book influence.	CHITCHAT
That's it.	CHITCHAT
I want that kind of compliance.	CHITCHAT
So that I can, uh, you know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Have a I think I have a screen or I think I have screen.	CHITCHAT
I just remembered that I want to have a convo influences that grew up on com books.	CHITCHAT
I grew up in asking mythology and uh, in so I wanted to reflect my style.	CHITCHAT
My art.	CHITCHAT
My theme.	CHITCHAT
And even though of course, like I said, lots of Mexicans draw astic artwork.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to be just another I want I don't want it to look just like another Mexican drawing.	CHITCHAT

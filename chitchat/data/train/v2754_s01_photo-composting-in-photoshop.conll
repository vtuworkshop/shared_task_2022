Did the job.	O
Look at this photo shop perfectly selected as a girl.	O
Now I will click on select in mask tab, right next to select subject.	O
And I will be redirected to select and mask aboard space.	O
Selecting masterworks was my favorite workspace in Adobe photo shop.	CHITCHAT
I can do anything.	CHITCHAT
I delight in this workspace.	O
I can adjust my selection.	O
I can.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Um, at all removed to my selection, anything I like and the best part I don't need to jump between different tools.	O
I don't need to jump it with different workspace.	O
Everything in the same box space, which is awesome.	O
If I will zoom in as this image, you will see that's what the shop did.	O
A great job, but I would like to in little bit smooth lines at the age of her or her.	O
Let's talk about properties panel in selected mask board space.	O
First of all, I would like to bring your attention to view mode.	O
My favorite view mode is onionskin.	O
And I will explain you why.	O
As you can see, I'm in skin.	O
If you more test transparency slider.	O
If I will move transparency slider all the way to the left.	O
Just like this, I will bring my background back.	O
Hi hi.	CHITCHAT
Hi, better.	CHITCHAT
If I will move my transparency slider all the way to the right, I basically will remove, I will illuminate.	O
Is this a background in?	CHITCHAT
I will be able to preview the layer below my current layer so I can preview my background layer in if I will need to adjust my main subject.	O
My girl in this case I can do it.	O
Right away.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I prefer to move my transparency slider somewhere in the Middle Becausr if Photoshop missed anything and I would like to fix ages of her dress or her, I will clearly preview on my original image in I will see what I missed.	O
Working with her on my favorite view mode is a black invite.	O
As you can see I can clearly preview this a mask, and now I will switch to refined age brush.	O
This is beautiful brush I will.	CHITCHAT
A simply paint at the age of her hair.	O
Slightly guys just like that.	CHITCHAT
And now I have smooth transitions between her hair and.	O
Uh, background, let me switch back to onionskin.	O
So no, I have everything.	O
I love everything and let's talk about output setting my favorite output setting is output to knew layer with a layer mask in.	O
I will describe why Justin second, an also I pretty much 99.9 checking.	CHITCHAT
Cars just like this and I will click OK.	O
No guys as you can see I have three layers.	O
First layer is my original background layer, second layer is my original main subject, a girl layer, an third layer is knew layer with a layer mask photo shop.	O
Uh, no, I have hidden my original a girl later because I don't need this layer anymore.	O
So now I can delete it.	O
Remember guys, I ask you always specify knew layer with layer mask white if I will if I will need to change anything if I will need to adjust my selection or masking I will simply double click on a layer mask.	O
Just like this and I will be redirected back to select and mask board space an I can do anything I like and I will click OK or cancel in my case, how you can.	O

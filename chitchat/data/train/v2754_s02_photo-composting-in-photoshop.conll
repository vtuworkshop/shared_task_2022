Just like that.	CHITCHAT
Let's continue working on our project.	O
So as I'm sorry I scrolled it.	CHITCHAT
And let me in little bit zoom out just like that.	O
Now I will reposition my main subject.	O
This girl just like this.	CHITCHAT
Guys I would like to bring your attention to bottom or dress as you notice I leave I didn't.	O
Mask out kind of part of original, a grass or original ground.	O
A pixels of why becausr?	CHITCHAT
In my case it will create something very unique.	O
Something very beautiful.	CHITCHAT

Definitely I can do in.	O
You can do anything you want in photo shop, but be more creative and make your workflow easier if it's possible so.	CHITCHAT
Is this system?	CHITCHAT
I mean subject?	CHITCHAT
Now let's bring more add details into our a project.	O
On Zoom in, zoom in just slightly turn.	O
If I'd just like that, yes, now I will launch a pixel squid plugin if you know me.	O
You know how much I love pixel squid.	CHITCHAT
Flag in pixels becausr using pixels.	O
Quit plug in Aiken.	O
I use any 3D object and the best part I don't need to create 3D object from scratch.	O
I can go to pixelsquid.com and download any 3D object.	O
I would like to work with and Vala.	CHITCHAT
Everything is in photo shop first of all.	O
I will highlight my background later because I would like to add my ability object behind my main subject an I will click on this chair and Voila, I don't need to do anything else.	O
what I need to do I need to rotate my chair in a way I like.	O
I can rotate my 3D object differently from a pixel squid plugin.	O
I will click on my object and I will rotate it.	O
Just like that now I will switch to the move tool and I will size this chair down an I will reposition it.	O
Just like this is perfect now I will ask pixels with by being ignored pixel screen plugin.	O
Yes, I would like to have shadow in my 3D object and also I would like to have my 3D object in high resolution so I will switch from low to high resolution and this is only what I need to do.	O
Pixel squid is smart enough to understand about.	O
I'm trying to do.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
I will select my background layer again.	O
And I will add another 3D object I downloaded from my pixel script plugin.	O
I will click on this street alarm just like that.	O
Definitely I need to rotate it an I can do directly from pixel squid plugin using the move tool.	O
I will scale size down in Aguilera position it right behind my chair just like this.	O
And yes, I would like to have shadow under my lamp.	O
And yes I would like to have my alarm in high resolution and as the last 3D object I would like to bring into my document is not the last.	O

I will rotate it in a way I like using them move too.	O
I will size it down.	O
I will any position it next on top of this.	O
Tree branch but guys to be more creative.	CHITCHAT
I would like to rotate this great so using same move tool I will slightly rotate it and I will reposition it.	O
Just like that.	O
In this case guys I don't need to have shadow under my arm 3D object, but yes I would like to have my 3D object in high resolution so I will switch from low to high resolution if I will zoom in my document you will see that yes, I have very nice.	O
Great that it positioned not in the right away so using the move tool I will pick it and.	O
I will position it in a way I like and now guys I have another problem.	O

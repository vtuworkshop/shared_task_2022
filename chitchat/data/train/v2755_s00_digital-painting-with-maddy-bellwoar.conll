Hi everybody, good morning.	CHITCHAT
Good afternoon, good evening whatever time it is for you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
Hi Fernando Allison, Welcome.	CHITCHAT
I hope you've had a good day so far.	CHITCHAT
I hope you've all been well.	CHITCHAT
If I haven't seen you since last week, I hope you had a good weekend.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be doing some digital painting today.	O
As usual, I'm going to be working from this photo as a reference.	O
I think it's really beautiful.	CHITCHAT
It's like a little cafe table in Spain, with some dappled lighting coming through these trees.	O
I really like the pattern of light on the building over here, and the just overall feeling the different colors.	O
the Blues and pinks and yellows on the wall here.	O
It's really, really cheerful scene.	CHITCHAT
Hi Mohammed, high pro, how are you?	CHITCHAT
I hope you're all doing well.	CHITCHAT
If you guys are interested in painting along with me or doing a little sketch or whatever, you have time for your always welcome to my reference.	CHITCHAT
Image is below in the stream description and above the chat.	CHITCHAT
Also, if you check the info panel it should be there as well so this photo is from Unsplash.	CHITCHAT
You can find a link to the original post from the photographer below.	CHITCHAT
The stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing pretty good pro to be honest.	CHITCHAT
I have a little bit of a sore throat, so today's stream might be a tiny bit shorter than some of the others.	CHITCHAT
It's still going to be around 3 hours minimum.	CHITCHAT
Is what I have planned to work on this if I'm feeling good, we might go on or do another painting, but I'm drinking some tea with honey and I have to kind of be careful with my voice a little bit talking so much, but I'm otherwise I'm good.	CHITCHAT
Um prob hey welcome Hi Kumar.	CHITCHAT
So again, that's where you can find my references below in the stream description.	CHITCHAT
You guys are welcome to paint along if you're interested in doing that.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise, just sit back and relax and enjoy the painting.	CHITCHAT
I'll try to do a nice job with this one.	CHITCHAT
I hope it's going to be good.	CHITCHAT
I really like the reference so.	CHITCHAT
Hi Dante.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to explain my painting process as we go through here.	O
And if you guys have any questions you can let me know.	CHITCHAT
I am using pure ref to put the little reference image up here so we can see a thumbnail view of it while we're painting.	O
My canvas sizes 3000 by 2000 pixels.	O
If you're curious.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I'm using a different Cup today.	CHITCHAT
This is my Starbucks Florida Cup.	CHITCHAT
Maybe more information than you need, but yeah, so I'm I grew up in Florida.	CHITCHAT
I've lived in a few different states, but where I spent most of my life was in Florida so.	CHITCHAT
I don't live there now.	CHITCHAT

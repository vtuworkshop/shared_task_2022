I live in the Netherlands so I have this Cup as like little reminder of my past home.	CHITCHAT
All thank you Susan, I really appreciate that I'm I'm trying to fight it of.- High AC, good to see you again.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's get started with the painting.	CHITCHAT
I'm a little nervous about this one in the sense that it's a complicated one with perspective and a lot going on, but it's a really, really pretty scene, so I hope it's going to be fun regardless of the challenge.	CHITCHAT
I want to pick a color to use as like a background underpainting because I think that would be nice.	O
It's a little bit of a sort of traditional art method, but I think would work well in this scene, so I'm going to pick a color that's close to what a lot of traditional artists would use as a like a burnt Sienna underpainting in their work so.	CHITCHAT
My goal with my digital paintings, especially lately I've explored different styles overtime, but especially lately I'm interested in creating paintings that feel like more like traditional paintings, so I like to use some traditional techniques in my digital work.	CHITCHAT
So for this one, I think it might be fun to try a slightly different approach.	O
I hope it's going to be interesting to watch instead of making a detailed sketch ahead of time, I'm going to try to.	O
Work in shapes, so I'm going to try to block this in and shapes and I'm not going to do a sketch so wish me luck.	O
I think I'm gonna need it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you pro, uh, we're going to try to just work in shapes so there's a couple of ways to do this to get nice, clean sharp shapes.	O
One thing you can do is use the lasso tool.	O
This is super super handy for this kind of thing, so for example.	CHITCHAT
I can take the Polygon lasso tool and make a big selection of this whole back wall.	O
So now that selected, I can use whatever brush I want within their an.	O
Obviously it's only going to let me paint within the selection so I can start blocking in some color back there.	O
Hey Emily, how are you good to see you?	CHITCHAT
And we I'm trying something new here so we'll see how it's going to go.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try without a sketch for this one, so when I do traditional gouache painting I don't usually sketch on my paper before I start painting.	O
I do often usually make a separate set a sketch on a separate piece of paper just to think through the composition a little bit.	O
So anyway.	CHITCHAT
Long story short.	CHITCHAT
In traditional, I feel more comfortable going in without a sketch.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to kind of embrace that a little bit in my digital here and see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to keep my brush pretty big 'cause I don't want to get into any details yet.	O
I want to look at the big picture and just block in big patches of color so.	O
If I don't pick the right color the first time, no problem.	O
Maybe it'll just be like a happy little accident.	CHITCHAT
It will make things more interesting, so will just paint over it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to take the approach of painting over mistakes as much as possible rather than erasing them out.	O
I mean, I still might do little control Z here in there.	O
To get a nice fresh align like this, sometimes you just want to get that one perfect brush stroke.	O
But my point is, when it comes to painting over colors, maybe if I chose the wrong color, I'm going to try to stick to painting over rather than like erasing out.	O
For example, 'cause that might help give a more traditional kind of feeling to this with layers of different color.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
One of the downsides to this kind of style is at the early stages of the painting.	O
Can be very messy and abstract, which isn't necessarily inherently a problem, but it could be a little discouraging.	O
If you are having a hard time visualizing where this is going to go from here to the end, sometimes it can be a little discouraging to see it at this stage 'cause it's confusing, but we're going to get there going to get there, so.	O
Trying to stick to big big big shapes, big patches of color.	O
It's almost like I'm looking at the reference as if it's.	O
As if I had took off my glasses and it's just slightly blurry, so that's kind of how I'm trying to visualize this.	O
So there's one wall down and going to deselect and then make a new selection of the left back wall.	O
So now I've selected that.	O
And I'm going to begin with the yellow is trying to find the right color.	O
Go a little bit darker at the bottom.	O
That's not it.	O
Little warmer, maybe loops.	O
Hope you're all doing well.	CHITCHAT

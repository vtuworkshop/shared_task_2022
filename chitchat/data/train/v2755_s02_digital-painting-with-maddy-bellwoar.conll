Those of you who are just getting here as usual, you can always find my references linked below if you're interested in doing a little painting of this one with me, I'd definitely be curious to see how we might have some different interpretations of this one.	CHITCHAT
Hi hanji, lickin well waiting on hold to try and get some better broadband.	CHITCHAT
Oh OK.	CHITCHAT
Good idea.	CHITCHAT
That will definitely help with the whole streaming thing.	CHITCHAT
Well good luck hanji.	CHITCHAT
Hey red, it's really good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Well, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
Abdul Rahman Hi.	CHITCHAT
Welcome how are you?	CHITCHAT
Hope you're doing good.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now we have very very roughly the back wall and the side wall, and I know that there's some perspective issues here.	O
I think already.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to Obsess.	O
We're going to keep it loose, so let's go to the next stage.	O
Will be able to fix things as we go.	O
Test my connection was so bad.	CHITCHAT
How are you today?	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for the most part.	CHITCHAT
I have a little little tiny bit of a sore throat so I drinking tea and yeah, hopefully will see I'm gonna do one painting today and we'll see if I can do more.	CHITCHAT
I might have to kind of have this be a little bit of a shorter stream, but I'm trying not to get sick.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to get sick.	CHITCHAT
Hi PC and I hope you don't mind if I abbreviate your name.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for coming over here.	CHITCHAT
Play Nori in the world, the wisps.	CHITCHAT
Oh, enjoy today's the day right.	CHITCHAT
It just came out today.	CHITCHAT
If I'm remembering, right.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, I cannot wait.	CHITCHAT
Hey, if you.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to interrupt your playthrough, enjoy yourself, but if you do see any good screenshots and if you take any good screenshots, maybe we'll end up painting one of them.	CHITCHAT
I know the game is super beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy, enjoy.	CHITCHAT
I really like this blue bounce light on the ground.	O
You guys see that there's a really, really cool effects on the ground here.	O
Hide Rado.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Hun.	CHITCHAT
Gee, I notice that.	CHITCHAT
If I'm not streaming, tends to be rough on your voice a little bit with a lot of talking.	CHITCHAT
Hey Stephanie, it's more to la welcome, but an awesome reference.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
You know I have such a weakness for this lighting.	O
I'll show it up close real quick for you guys.	O
So pretty such a beautiful mood, the dappled lighting makes me happy, so I'm trying to take a loose, painterly, traditional painting kind of approach here.	O
So that is what we're starting with.	O
And just trying to block in colors.	O
And get get something started.	O
I didn't make a sketch for this, so that's another experiment I usually do.	O
But yeah, I felt like trying something new today.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Emily.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I will.	CHITCHAT
I will try to be in tune with how I'm feeling and play if I actually need to.	CHITCHAT
Will take a break, I promise.	CHITCHAT
It's me, know hers.	CHITCHAT
I remember I remember.	CHITCHAT
I'll try to think about it.	CHITCHAT
I promise if you wanna play the game Maddie and everyone else, it's mostly free.	CHITCHAT
It's an Xbox game pass on only one euro for three months, so that is a very good deal.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it is very handy.	CHITCHAT
This technique with using the lasso tool you can.	O
Yeah, as you said in chat, there's there's a good you can use it for.	CHITCHAT
Perspective and blocking off areas.	O
If you're if you need to, if you want to paint something a little bit more with hard edges, it's very, very handy for that.	O
So now I'm going to merge them together, so I kept the layers separate while it was beginning, but now I'm OK with them being together.	O
So merge everything.	O
For me, doing a lot of merging just helps me to commit to my decisions as I paint, and when I do painting where I try to get a little bit more of a traditional feeling, I tend to merge more often for that reason.	O
Wonderful color, thank you.	O
It's such a pretty image with beautiful happy colors.	CHITCHAT

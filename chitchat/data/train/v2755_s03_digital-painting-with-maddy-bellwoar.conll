OK, so I want to try so one thing that I'm going to try to make this a little bit less intimidating because I think this reference could be a little bit intimidating.	CHITCHAT
There's just so much going on I'm going to try to work from big to small.	O
Hey Jackson, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I you know I will just you know, I love this kind of scene.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying it with no sketch.	CHITCHAT
We're going to try as if it was gouache painting.	O
For me.	CHITCHAT
So I'm working big to small, so I'm going to be blocking in areas based on.	O
That's principle, so just getting this window in here 'cause it's a pretty big shape in the background.	O
And what are the next biggest things?	O
I'm starting to think that I need to do trees next.	O
Um abdulrahman hello again.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
I see a big Terra cotta type.	O
Color back here.	O
I think it's part of the wall.	O
I think it's actually on the wall.	O
I thought at first it was like a plant pot, but it's I think it's actually a pattern on the wall.	O
I'm trying not to zoom in very much on my reference, so as a result sometimes it's actually a little bit hard to tell what I'm looking at, but the point is, I don't want to get too sucked into details.	O
It shouldn't really matter what exactly I'm looking at.	O
The idea is I should be able to look at overall the shape of the object and paint it in just fine even without knowing what it is I should be able to see the shape and recreate something that.	O
Makes sense.	O
So that's what I'm trying to do.	CHITCHAT
So now over here on the right we have some other windows and doors and things, so if we're going to simplify it to me, what I end up seeing is a lot of vertical stripes.	O
You know, it's not necessarily that we can tell every exact detail of what's happening with every Doran, what exactly?	O
Exact pattern of the architecture, but I think it's important just to get this striping effect of the doors and Windows first and then we can get more and more precise with like which windows have little bars and gates and things like that.	O
But for now I'm just going to start with.	CHITCHAT
Where do I see the big vertical stripes?	O
Roughly.	O
And there might be mistakes here.	O
Oh, thank you, I see, thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's very nice of you.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can download you guys.	CHITCHAT
Can download some of my brushes below the stream in the description if you're interested.	CHITCHAT
Some of the brushes that I'm using today are custom ones that I'm working on creating for future set that will be available so not all the brushes that I'm using are available now, but a lot of them are.	O
So if you want to grab those you can.	O
If you're looking for some brushes that have.	O
Painterly, kind of feeling.	O
One of my favorite places in the picture is this really really bright area on the wall over here on the right.	O
It's so beautiful right around the window.	CHITCHAT
This really, really bright Patch and then all the little.	O
Patches of leaves.	O
Oh, you're hear all your Disney Princess Hair looks amazing.	CHITCHAT
You're so sweet.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'll, I'll take it, thank you, that's very sweet.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy my hair is getting a little bit longer.	CHITCHAT
Finally, feels like it's taking awhile.	CHITCHAT
I know realistically it's going pretty fast, but.	CHITCHAT
I want it to be long again.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just painting in the big shape of this splash of light around the window.	O
I'm not getting into every individual little leaf shape that appears there that's going to come in the future, but right now we're just doing.	O
We're just doing the big big shape.	O
Chazzan loading properly, uh, no, I can't see any updated message and mine either.	CHITCHAT

At least I know you can read them.	CHITCHAT
That's so funny so you can hear me respond to you so you know I can see your message.	CHITCHAT
I wonder what's happening I'm sure you already tried refreshing so I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
If you want, you could take a screenshot for me late for later I could.	CHITCHAT
Send the info to be hands and let them know that there was an issue.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know if the screenshot will show anything.	CHITCHAT
If it's basically a blank chat, what you're seeing then?	CHITCHAT
That's not, then there's not much to see.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Mohammed.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I so love the late on that wall.	CHITCHAT
Me too me too.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited to get into all the little details of it.	CHITCHAT
I have to kind of use my self control to not go now and start painting all the little leaves and stuff.	O
Yet I want to make sure that I at least get up.	CHITCHAT
You know more things in the center of the image is a lot more.	O
I need to do before I indulge in all the little leaf painting.	O
I totally agree with you.	CHITCHAT
And the light comes all the way back up here.	O
This kind of image, it just makes me want to go on vacation.	CHITCHAT
That makes me want it to be summer vacation.	CHITCHAT
Having little drink at this cafe.	CHITCHAT
Painting seems like this.	CHITCHAT
I find very relaxing.	CHITCHAT
New coffee us.	CHITCHAT
It's actually not that new, but I don't use it as often as my Penguin one, but that would need to be washed.	CHITCHAT
So instead we're in tropical Florida today.	CHITCHAT
I guess this fits the mood, doesn't it?	CHITCHAT
Ohmygosh it has the same colors as my painting that wasn't even on purpose, but I'll take it.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I hope you enjoy the brushes.	CHITCHAT
There is one in there right now.	CHITCHAT
The one of the brushes in that brush site is called rectangular texture.	O
It's a good one to use for stuff like this.	O
Rock, sandstone walls and different things.	O
Different things of that nature.	O
Hi Ryan Maybe someday Disney will produce a story about an art Princess gliding through the Internet, building out.	CHITCHAT
I feasts of art to the masses.	CHITCHAT
Hey Ryan, get to see you.	CHITCHAT
Hey I would watch that.	CHITCHAT
I would watch that.	CHITCHAT
Ryan, I'm taking a gouache approach to this one.	CHITCHAT
That's the idea.	CHITCHAT
Will see how it's going to work.	CHITCHAT
But I'm trying to treat this more like my gouache painting.	CHITCHAT
You guys, it's so silly, but I often think to myself, why do I get these certain results in my?	CHITCHAT
traditional painting.	CHITCHAT
I want to get these types of results in my digital painting it.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is.	CHITCHAT
I have big differences in my workflow between traditional and digital, and I think that's part of what causes a difference in style.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to try painting this as if I was painting it in Gouache and see what happens because I think that will change the results.	CHITCHAT
Be hands on Mobile is not working as good as desktop.	CHITCHAT
My videos constantly black and I only get the audio.	CHITCHAT
The good part is I still get to hear Maddie's lovely voice.	CHITCHAT
Well, thank you, but I'm sorry to hear that that's happening.	CHITCHAT
Must be where I live.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Alright, Thanks for the feedback you guys.	CHITCHAT
So are you also on the Mobil One?	CHITCHAT
I guess so Jackson.	CHITCHAT
I can let them know that that's having some problems.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Ryan.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
This blue is just magic.	O
OK, so we have one door here.	O
And then a couple.	O
I believe windows we're going to be adding a bunch of.	O
I'm really trying not to get too.	O
Is that too much detail?	O
I'm really trying to stick with.	O
Big stripes of color right now.	O
Until we go into the next phase.	O
Kind of hard for me to avoid going in.	O
Start painting little little tiny things.	O
I think I went a bit too high with this door that doesn't.	O
Seem.	CHITCHAT
Seem right, they might have different Heights and things, but we don't need Giants living here.	O
I'm on both.	O
IPad to see you and PC for the invisible chat.	CHITCHAT

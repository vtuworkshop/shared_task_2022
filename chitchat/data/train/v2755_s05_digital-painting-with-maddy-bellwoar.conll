Oh my thank you, you guys.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for your dedication.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for being here.	CHITCHAT
Despite the tech some tech difficulties.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you're here.	CHITCHAT
And painting along.	CHITCHAT
Yes, enjoy, hey, if you guys are painting along happy painting, I hope you enjoy this one.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to make a new layer every so often so that we can kind of see the progress of this.	O
Maybe I do need to make those little higher.	O
I just want all the doors in a row to seem.	O
That there.	CHITCHAT
In proportion coming towards us.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So let's get some windows up here.	O
Looks like such a nice place to have a coffee and do some sketching.	CHITCHAT
Today my couch potato dumpling.	CHITCHAT
I'm moving into the customer support helps me with my tablet.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I hope you're able to get it resolved really quickly.	CHITCHAT
Having problems with your.	CHITCHAT
Tablet is the worst.	CHITCHAT
It's really the worst.	CHITCHAT
Kind of stuck not being able to do any any art and you work.	CHITCHAT
Great idea to try and copy your same painting method.	CHITCHAT
That should really help and in a way it helps us learn both traditional and digital.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's true.	CHITCHAT
It's true.	CHITCHAT
You can apply a lot of the same well.	O
Of course the fundamental things are the same.	O
Like you know, composition rules and all those things those are going to be the same no matter your medium, but I find that.	O
Yeah, I take such a different approach.	O
With traditional and then I and then I wonder why does it look different?	CHITCHAT
So there should be something interesting.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Ha, thank you bro.	CHITCHAT
That's sweet of you.	CHITCHAT
I think painting older buildings, buildings with more character, historical buildings and those types of places are really, really enjoyable because they have a lot of charm.	CHITCHAT
And they also for me are little less stressful to paint rather than modern skyscraper or something that's very very.	CHITCHAT
Clean and geometrical and you know the perspective needs to be really, really perfect to kind of sell it.	CHITCHAT
I think it's nice to do.	CHITCHAT
Older buildings, buildings with a lot of character and buildings that if you make a little bit of a miss mark here or there.	CHITCHAT
Or a little bit of a mistake with some of the perspective.	CHITCHAT
It's not so noticeable.	CHITCHAT
It's a if anybody's looking into wanting to get into painting more buildings and scenery and stuff.	CHITCHAT
I always recommend starting well.	CHITCHAT
First starting with landscapes that are like just in a natural setting, so maybe without buildings or cars or things like that and just organic shapes, I think those are the most friendly at the beginning.	CHITCHAT
This is just kind of from my personal experience.	CHITCHAT
If you find a different thing works for you, that's always fine, of course, but.	CHITCHAT
I find that going with natural subjects is easier at first because tree shapes you know all those things they can be there can be such a big variety in our brains don't really mind if a tree has a little bit of a weird shape to it or something we're used to seeing those kind of things in nature.	CHITCHAT
But it's a little bit more obvious with buildings and cars.	CHITCHAT
If something's not right.	CHITCHAT
Emily says I was watching a video on how to make your paintings look more traditional, and they suggested painting in one layer, not using undo button like you would in traditional basically.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that's a good tip.	CHITCHAT
I think that's a good tip for me.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
Necessarily feel the need to be like super super strict with those rules, but I am kind of taking a little bit of that idea with what I'm doing here.	CHITCHAT
I'm just not being like.	CHITCHAT
Overly strict with it.	CHITCHAT
I do think that it's nice to be able to use your digital tools for the advantages they give you and sometimes.	CHITCHAT
In some situations I feel like it's really handy to be able to make that perfect brushstroke.	CHITCHAT

Sometimes in Gouache I really miss being able to have a second try at something.	CHITCHAT
So in that case, sometimes I will use undo still, but I'm I'm trying to take that advice in a general sense and.	CHITCHAT
Not use it excessively and to choose to paint over.	CHITCHAT
It's a really difficult habit to break.	CHITCHAT
That's the main problem.	CHITCHAT
It's not that I'm so against it, it's just that my I'm so used to using these keyboard shortcuts.	CHITCHAT
It's so difficult.	CHITCHAT
I press them without thinking.	CHITCHAT
It's almost autopilot, but one thing that I do, I do try to have the mindset of painting on one layer.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually using multiple layers because I like to be able to look back and see the steps, but I'm painting right now, like right on the layer of my painting.	O
And I'll probably duplicate this layer in a few minutes and.	O
You know, just have it for my records.	CHITCHAT
Go on to the next layer.	O
So I yeah, I think that's a really good tip.	CHITCHAT
Always said painting either on one layer or even if you're using multiple layers.	O
Kind of pretending that you're on one layer.	O
And when I say pretending you're on one layer, what I mean is, for example, if I'm going to make a new layer here, I can start painting now, but without changing the way that I'm painting at all, just painting freely like I would normally.	O
But technically my layers above here.	O
That way you can still kind of look.	O
You can still kind of turn the layer on and off and check and see if everything is going well before it's officially merged down until you're painting, but you get the stylized stylization benefit of having painted everything.	O
In one, like in one layer, I think you still get the same benefits from that.	O
Personally, as long as your.	CHITCHAT
Kind of, I think is a mindset thing there.	CHITCHAT
Can I share my window please?	CHITCHAT
OK, honey says our provider has an offer on.	CHITCHAT
We have been with them so long.	CHITCHAT
We can upgrade to ultrafast broadband.	CHITCHAT
Whoa for less money.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Oh man Hunji Congratz That's so awesome.	CHITCHAT
Let's see you.	CHITCHAT
You definitely have to celebrate those wins when they happen.	CHITCHAT
That's great.	CHITCHAT
That's really great.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to do a little bit of editing of my work here.	O
I'm going to make a selection of this area on the right.	O
This these this window let me go to layer new layer via copy or control J so I have this on its own layer now.	O
Go to edit transform perspective.	O
I think I'd like to make this bigger.	O
An apply more perspective to it, I just don't feel like.	O
I'm really selling the perspective on that.	O
Wall, so I'm using a bunch of transform tools to try to.	O
That doesn't look right either.	O
It's definitely a bit wonky.	CHITCHAT
It's definitely bit wonky at the moment.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to move it over.	O
Make it bigger and I think that little.	O
I think this is the main problem here.	O
So before we get too far along.	O
I can ask him to confirm like five times he like.	CHITCHAT
It's too good to be true.	CHITCHAT
For me it's like a nature to use my thumb to undo even when I'm using a normal keyboard.	CHITCHAT
My thumb still thinks it.	CHITCHAT
Anything that can reach it undo.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I definitely get that feeling my.	CHITCHAT
Keyboard shortcuts are just so ingrained that I have a really hard time to try any of those challenges where you're not supposed to use a certain thing, like undo or something like that.	CHITCHAT
I have a really hard time sticking to the challenge because my fingers are just pressing those keys without even thinking.	CHITCHAT
I would have to disable the shortcut if I really wanted to not use it.	CHITCHAT
Hi Monir, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Reads as I try to screenshot from the game I hope you don't mind 'cause I can't remove it.	CHITCHAT
Posted on the discord.	CHITCHAT
Oh, let me see.	CHITCHAT
Boo.	CHITCHAT
The lighting is so pretty in this game.	CHITCHAT
This is a screenshot red took in the ori and the blind forest which just came out.	CHITCHAT
It might be fun to do.	CHITCHAT
Some painting from this game.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful glowy lights and things.	CHITCHAT
All that's very kind of you to be looking out for taking spoiler free.	CHITCHAT
Screenshots, that's very sweet of you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think a lot of people are going to play that one, so it's nice to consider.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to flip my canvas and I'm going to flip my reference.	O

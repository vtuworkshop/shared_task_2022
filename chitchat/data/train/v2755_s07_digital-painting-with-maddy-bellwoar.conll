This is hopefully going to help me take a fresh look at what I'm doing here and maybe make some adjustments.	O
If you guys ever start to feel really lost in your painting and you can't.	O
Figure out what's wrong, but maybe something is bugging you.	O
It really helps to flip your canvas horizontally.	O
Then you will kind of trick your brain into.	O
Reprocessing the image.	O
So you're going to see it fresh in a new way.	O
Sometimes after we've been looking at something for awhile, it's hard to.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to really tell what's going on there.	CHITCHAT
Some things that.	CHITCHAT
You think?	CHITCHAT
We're working.	CHITCHAT
There might be something off with it and you just can't see it anymore.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, flipping the image can be really, really handy.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to put in tiny bit of these little dashboard lights just so we can figure we can start to think about.	O
The lighting scenario there, but I definitely want to do more later.	O
Yeah, season it exactly right.	CHITCHAT
Not knowing the keyboard shortcuts, would it actually be a benefit in this case?	CHITCHAT
Because if you were trying to paint traditionally so that way you wouldn't be going on autopilot and clicking away.	CHITCHAT
It's so hard to turn that of.-.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I think this is time for me to make a new layer because I want to be able to look back at this process and I think if we don't make a new layer now then we're going to end up having one of those tutorials where you have like one step and then it's like finished in the next step and you're like, wait is like it was.	CHITCHAT
I supposed to see anything in between there.	CHITCHAT
So OK will save now will keep going.	O
From here.	O
And for me, I also find that it's nice to kind of work around the painting and not spend two too much time in one spot.	O
So I'm going to try to rap things up with this pink wall over here is getting a lot more attention than the rest of the scene right now, and it is closest to us, so I think it's it's alright to focus in a little bit, but I don't want to get too stuck when we have other areas of the painting that still need.	O
Our attention quite a lot might be time to flip again to go back to our original.	O
Oh, the start to finish hashtag yes, although I am really enjoying that hashtag, I have to admit I've there have been a bunch of artists that I found through that that I didn't know before.	CHITCHAT
Like I'm seeing some amazing art because of it.	CHITCHAT
Like a lot of those trends kind of introduce you to new artists, the.	CHITCHAT
What was the other recent ones?	CHITCHAT
The tune me and all those little things that go around, but this one more than any other one has found like really amazing artists because of it.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of showing up on my timeline on Twitter, so I'm happy.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's definitely like the most extreme case of of that.	CHITCHAT
With that classic.	CHITCHAT
Rest of the owl tutorial.	CHITCHAT
Super interesting to follow, but it's truly not educational.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's just.	CHITCHAT
It's only for me.	CHITCHAT
It's just pure eye candy.	CHITCHAT
Seem like these beautiful artworks, but it's definitely not.	CHITCHAT
We need a little bit.	CHITCHAT
We need a few more steps in there to really learn something.	CHITCHAT
Something.	CHITCHAT
One thing that it does show is just that a lot of beautiful, beautiful artworks of humble beginnings, which can be an encouraging thing.	CHITCHAT
To see.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I will move along back to.	O
This wall over here and I don't necessarily like what I did with this shadow in the center, so I'm going to take that away.	O
Will try again.	CHITCHAT
So new layer.	O
There's a few.	O

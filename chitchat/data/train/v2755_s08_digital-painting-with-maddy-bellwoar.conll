Interesting shadows here of.	O
Little balconies that extend out from the wall.	O
So I I do kind of want to at least start getting some of these shadows in.	O
But I'm not sure exactly.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
What's the best way to simplify these shapes?	O
I want to give for the viewer the impression.	O
Of what's here, but without so specifically, drawing every little detail of it.	O
So I'm trying to figure out how to do that with shapes, blocks of color.	O
Just kind of putting the right shapes roughly in the right place.	O
About a ton of precision of the detail, I think we can still give the idea.	O
OK, up here the.	O
The blue.	O
Wall has a light shining on it too, so we've got really bright white and then coming up right next to it on the left.	O
We've got the.	O
The yellow, so it's.	O
Nice contrast.	O
I'm looking forward to painting in the.	O
Plants.	O
I think that would be my next thing.	CHITCHAT
I might pop in a little bit more of this, warm, almost hot orange color.	O
I really, really like it.	CHITCHAT
Anubhav, hi welcome.	CHITCHAT
For you.	CHITCHAT
So it might be good to turn my painting into black-and-white, turn the reference into black and white, and have a look.	O
This definitely helps.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
I mean my painting is in the early stages, but we really get a feeling of what's missing.	O
So as the scene gets further away from us, this whole area is quite a bit darker.	O
The trees are darker, but this whole area is more in Shadow and then over here, generally lighter.	O
So we need to boost up the lighting in the area closer to us.	O
An overall dark in the area down further.	O
Hey, I'm above I.	CHITCHAT
Sadly I don't know how to do that, um.	CHITCHAT
I do have an artist that I know who does that type of Art.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if I can find.	CHITCHAT
Them really quick.	CHITCHAT
To give you a recommendation, 'cause I think he has some videos on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
I don't do movie posters but give me 1 second.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can find the artist name to recommend to you who might be able to give you some good.	CHITCHAT
Good info on that.	CHITCHAT
Trying to remember their account off the top of my head.	CHITCHAT
Alright, hold on I think I got it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, he's really good.	CHITCHAT
Let me give you a link.	CHITCHAT
He only has a couple YouTube videos.	CHITCHAT
I thought he had more.	CHITCHAT
I know this artist from Instagram.	CHITCHAT
I'm still going to post the link in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
I'll post the link to his.	CHITCHAT
Instagram too, I'm really amazed by his work.	CHITCHAT
He does photo bashing.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Photo bashing multiple images together to create things that would definitely appear to be movie poster type of artwork.	CHITCHAT
And he's a lot of his Instagram posts show behind the scenes and process things and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
So process and a lot of these are movie poster style artworks.	CHITCHAT
And for a lot of them you can see the behind the scenes like the pieces that came together.	CHITCHAT
To create the image.	CHITCHAT
So I hope it helps a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Sorry, I don't know more about it myself.	CHITCHAT
How many hours a day to practice to keep your skills sharp?	CHITCHAT

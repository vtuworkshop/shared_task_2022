Well for me it I stream four days a week.	CHITCHAT
I stream here and be hands on Wednesdays, but I also stream on Twitch on some other days so.	CHITCHAT
I street, so I'm doing are at least four days a week minimum.	CHITCHAT
And I like to do it more, but it depends from week to week if I'm busy with other things because I also have other aspects of my business that I have to do that aren't.	CHITCHAT
I'm not actually creating art, but rather like packing and shipping things and doing little things like that so I'm not able to make art every day even though I would love to paint every day.	CHITCHAT
Some days I don't.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's a minimum of four and as much as Seven that happens on occasion where I draw everyday.	CHITCHAT
But how many hours a day when I stream, it's generally between.	CHITCHAT
Four and Seven hours.	CHITCHAT
A stream on non stream days.	CHITCHAT
I might paint a couple hours.	CHITCHAT
Hi, some earth welcome.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let me check this out.	CHITCHAT
New BOF.	CHITCHAT
Do poster work here and be hands also.	CHITCHAT
Cool stuff.	CHITCHAT
I like this one.	CHITCHAT
This one looks definitely looks like a movie poster.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to know how to monetize our passion and create income as a designer.	CHITCHAT
Well, there's a lot of different ways to go about that.	CHITCHAT
You can take commissions, Commission work from clients.	CHITCHAT
That's one way to make money as an artist and creator.	CHITCHAT
You can create.	CHITCHAT
Tutorials sharing your process and sell the tutorials.	CHITCHAT
You can make prints of your work depending on what kind of Art you make.	CHITCHAT
I know this might be a little bit different in design, I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
It kind of depends, but some art styles work very well for prints and artwork that people like to hang on their walls so.	CHITCHAT
You know making your prints prints available is something you can do.	CHITCHAT
People come up with a lot of unique, niche ways of making a living as an artist.	CHITCHAT
I've noticed different kinds of merchandise and different things.	CHITCHAT
I guess one thing to do is keep an open mind.	CHITCHAT
There might be something that you think of doing that doesn't even exist yet.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit of a good drain pipe that comes down over here.	CHITCHAT
So if anybody is just arriving at the stream, I want to let you know what we're up to.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing a study of the photo that you see above here at a small size.	O
An I'm trying to take a traditional painting approach to it, even though I'm using photo shop.	O
Using some textured brushes and trying to think about this as if it was traditional paint and I'm hoping that that's going to give a certain type of feeling through the work.	O
But it's a little bit of an experiment.	O
But if you guys would like to join me, all the studies that I do here on be hands every Wednesday when I stream here I always share my reference image.	CHITCHAT
So if you are interested in joining me with a little painting or sketch or whatever, you have time time for you can grab the reference image.	CHITCHAT
It's below the stream in the description panel and it's also in the info and info panel above the chat, so that's where you can find the reference and.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to paint or sketch along, and you can always share what you do with the image in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Would be interested to see.	CHITCHAT
There's usually a few people painting along, and it's fun to see what different artstyle interpretations are.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Sure, I'll post my Instagram in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for asking.	CHITCHAT
So I actually have two Instagram accounts.	CHITCHAT
Sorry for being complicated, it's up to you which one you'd like to follow.	CHITCHAT
I have one for my traditional art and one for my digital art.	CHITCHAT
I assume you guys are probably.	CHITCHAT
Maybe more interested in digital arts.	CHITCHAT
Because you're watching digital art stream, but a lot of artists are into both.	CHITCHAT

So if you want to check out my.	CHITCHAT
If you want to check out my traditional paintings, I'm going to also post that one next and you can.	CHITCHAT
Check it out if you're interested.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to flip my reference up here too.	O
I finished my Witcher scene from yesterday.	CHITCHAT
Nice, I didn't get a chance to finish mine yet, but I'm definitely going to.	CHITCHAT
I actually wanted to work on it this morning, but I had a huge glare.	CHITCHAT
Look at these windows.	O
I had a huge glare on my monitor this morning.	CHITCHAT
Early in the day.	CHITCHAT
It's really hard for me to do digital art.	CHITCHAT
I would need to move my.	CHITCHAT
I would need to move my angle of my desk, but basically I wanted to work on my painting and I couldn't even do it because of this huge glare.	CHITCHAT
So anyway, if you want to share it, you're welcome to.	CHITCHAT
I would love to.	CHITCHAT
I would love to see it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you bro.	CHITCHAT
Sisanda high.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, 100 mils couldn't make it today.	CHITCHAT
He's OK but.	CHITCHAT
Something came up.	CHITCHAT
He might not be at streams for a few days.	CHITCHAT
For some IRL things.	CHITCHAT
But he's OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm just going to do a little bit more, will little bit more work on the windows.	O
And then I will be.	O
Putting in some plants finally, which I'm super excited about.	O
OK, so up to this point, I've been taking a very traditional approach to this painting.	O
I haven't been using a lot of layer blending modes or anything.	O
I've been sticking mostly to just a normal layer and painting on there with my paintbrush, but.	O
Earlier when we did a little bit of a value check, I noticed that my painting it wasn't nearly dark enough in a distance and it still has that problem.	O
'cause I haven't really addressed it yet, so I'm going to show you some ways of fixing this problem and I hope it might be interesting.	O
So OK, if I turn my painting into black and white and the reference into black-and-white, you'll see my issue.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
Do you see how the foreground in my painting the area closer to us, closer to the table in the windows?	O
Needs to be brighter and then the further area with the trees and everything will.	O
The trees aren't there yet, but that area needs to be darker so we've already painted quite a bit of stuff.	O
So I want to try to edit what I have there a little bit rather than like painting over everything completely.	O
So we can do some layer blending modes for that before we go into that, I just want to show you really quick how I turned my painting into black and white.	O
In case you don't know how to do that, there's a couple of ways you can do it, and it's really helpful for being able to see if your painting is going well with the shading, the darks and lights to see if the values are going well, because sometimes when you have all these bright colors it's hard to get a grip on the shading.	O
It can create some weird optical illusions and it's hard to tell, so if you go to view proof setup custom.	O
You want to set the device to simulate to working Gray dot gain 20%, so this is not something that's automatically set up in your photo shop, but if you follow the directions that I'm showing here, if you set it up one time, it's always going to be fine.	O
You're always going to be able to use a shortcut and do this switch quickly to black and white, so you go to view.	O
Proof set up custom and then set the device to simulate to working grade.	O
Gained 20% and then press OK and then every time you go you use uh control Y you will get a black and white version of your painting and the awesome thing about this is you can color pic while it's in this state you can color pic and paint and it's going to be using the real colors of your actual painting but showing you the black and white version.	O
So that's Super Super Handy and I hope you guys might find it useful.	CHITCHAT

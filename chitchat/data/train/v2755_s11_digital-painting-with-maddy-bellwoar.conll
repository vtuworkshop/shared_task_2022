Facing some problem in growing my Instagram as an artist.	CHITCHAT
Can you please brief us?	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I'm yeah, I'm happy to give advice if I can.	CHITCHAT
The only thing I want to say is I think that sometimes with Instagram and certain social medias.	CHITCHAT
Depending on the type of Art you're making, you might find easier growth on one platform versus another platform, sometimes certain platforms.	CHITCHAT
Have a certain type of content that tends to be like really popular there.	CHITCHAT
So for example, whether you decide to post on different platforms, you might find success in different places.	CHITCHAT
So, but what I've done on Instagram is just, you know.	CHITCHAT
Post pretty frequently if you can, so at some point in time I've been better or worse with this in the past, but post consistently you don't have to post constantly but get on a consistent schedule of some kind.	CHITCHAT
So even if that's once a week, just try to be somewhat consistent so there's like an even amount of space in between your posts.	CHITCHAT
Use hashtags.	CHITCHAT
Post when you post put some information about your content.	CHITCHAT
Don't just post an image with no information because it's less interesting to people.	CHITCHAT
So if it's an artwork, maybe talk about something that was difficult when you made it or something you learned.	CHITCHAT
Or what is your favorite part, or maybe what's your least favorite part or something about the art that might be interesting for people to learn about?	CHITCHAT
I use the hashtags and post multiple images if you can.	CHITCHAT
So maybe post the artwork and then some images of your process that's more interesting to people, and I've heard that the algorithms favor images with multiple.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, multiple images in the image carousel, so not just one would be good and those are some suggestions.	CHITCHAT
What about targeted audience?	CHITCHAT
Wait, what do you mean by that pro?	CHITCHAT
Can you give me some more information?	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry I'm not I do my own marketing as an artist, but I don't maybe know all the terminology and everything like I haven't studied marketing specifically in school or anything.	CHITCHAT
So when you say targeted, targeted audience, I think you're referring to.	CHITCHAT
Are you are you asking me?	CHITCHAT
How do you decide what your target audience is or what exactly are you asking me?	CHITCHAT
In the mean time I will start doing some shading here on the background, so I'm going to make a new layer and I will put my layer on multiply mode, multiply as a layer blending mode.	O
I like to use for shading, it darkens things, but it doesn't completely.	O
It doesn't cover like what it would do if I was using a normal layer, it's still going to show what is below my area that I'm painting, but it's just going to darken it.	O
So I'm going to choose a blue and I might.	O
I might change this color.	O
Yeah, it's not exactly the effect I want.	O
I think I'm going to go.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to take a different approach.	O
Multiply, multiply didn't work.	O
OK, so I'm going to make an you.	O
Adjustment layer I think adjustment layer is going to be better, so I'm going to come down here to the half circle icon and let's try levels.	O
So levels is going to affect the darks and lights in my painting.	O
An I can choose to darken.	O
The highlights, midtones and shadows.	O
This is also affecting the contrast, so you just kind of want to take a look and see if it's going well.	O
Definitely a lot more contrasts, but The thing is, I'm only interested in this affecting the further area of my painting really.	O
Uhm, the other thing we could use is curves.	O
Maybe curves is better.	O
Yeah, I think that's better.	CHITCHAT
OK so so here we go.	CHITCHAT
Finally I tried a few different things and I finally have the result that I want.	O
That's pretty common for me sometimes you gotta try different things to see what's going to do what you want.	CHITCHAT
Angie says use relevant hashtags but don't use any with millions of tags.	CHITCHAT
Use hashtags of things you think people might search.	CHITCHAT
Be active and support other artists by liking, commenting, sharing in their stories, etc.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much, Angie.	CHITCHAT
You're that's really good advice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you guys listen.	CHITCHAT
Take countries advice on that.	CHITCHAT
Just totally right.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to so now what I want to do is block out.	O
Areas that I don't want to be affected by this mask.	O
This adjustment layer that I created, so there's automatically a mask here you can see the rectangle that's.	O
Um, white.	O
If I take a black paint brush using airbrush right now anywhere that I paint with black, it's going to basically bring back the layer below.	O

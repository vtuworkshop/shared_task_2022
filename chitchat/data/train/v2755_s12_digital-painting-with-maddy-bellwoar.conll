That was lighter.	O
So anywhere that I want it to be later, all I have to do is paint with black onto this mask and then anywhere that I want to stay dark, I just.	O
Leave it alone.	O
So I think that's an improvement, so I'm going to merge it down because I don't, you know, the great thing about adjustment layers as you can leave them there, but for my purposes I'm trying to.	O
Yeah, I don't want.	CHITCHAT
I don't need it to stay there.	O
I just wanted to use it to do that darkening effect so.	O
Let's continue.	CHITCHAT
James is, if you haven't already, you can make your account and artist account and you can see insights.	CHITCHAT
The number of impressions on posts and see which hashtags work best.	CHITCHAT
That's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
I did that on one of my accounts and not the other one, and I've been thinking about doing it there too.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can see a lot more about.	CHITCHAT
Which posts are successful and kind of what's going on behind the scenes?	CHITCHAT
It'll analytics and things.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I want to start adding in foliage and plants.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Hun Ji.	CHITCHAT
It's good advice.	CHITCHAT
So I think for the first time in this painting, I'm going to switch to a different brush.	O
I'm trying to find something.	O
That would be good for what I want to do next.	O
You may end up just sticking with the same brush.	O
I just want to be good.	CHITCHAT
There's virtually no downside of converting an Instagram account to business.	CHITCHAT
Or is there?	CHITCHAT
I don't think there is a downside.	CHITCHAT
There were rumors that there was a downside that.	CHITCHAT
It was rumored that Instagram doesn't give as good engagement to like.	CHITCHAT
Business accounts as it does to regular account, so I don't know if the artist account would count as that, but.	CHITCHAT
I haven't personally experienced any negatives from switching my one account, so.	CHITCHAT
I might switch to the other one too.	CHITCHAT
Process related to an above question about growing Instagram artists account, so I say that what is target audience in related field?	CHITCHAT
I don't understand.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry bro.	CHITCHAT
You might just be going over my head like I don't understand the question.	CHITCHAT
I apologize.	CHITCHAT
Just that I'm not sure what you're asking me to answer.	CHITCHAT
What is the targeted audience?	CHITCHAT
Is that what you're asking?	CHITCHAT
I mean, it's good to think about.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if this is what you're referring to, but it is good to think about like who the type of person is that you're trying to reach with your posts, and what they would be interested in, and what hashtags they would use.	CHITCHAT
So if that's what you mean, I agree with that.	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're getting in our first tree shapes finally.	O
I'm probably going to do these on separate layers just so I have the freedom to move them around and really be sure where I'm placing the trees.	O
Once I'm going to one style, you know.	O
Firm that I'm happy with my choice, then I will.	CHITCHAT
Murdered down.	CHITCHAT
He's asking about whom should be target an who will like to see our post.	CHITCHAT
OK, OK?	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
I don't know that I have the answers to that.	CHITCHAT

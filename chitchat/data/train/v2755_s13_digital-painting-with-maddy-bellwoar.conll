Of course, that's something that I'm trying to do a good job with as well when I'm posting, but that's a little bit of something that you kind of learn as you go, I think.	CHITCHAT
And it depends on the individual what they're trying to do with their art.	CHITCHAT
Are you trying to create a portfolio that?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, exactly hungry or it will depend on the person and what their goals are with their art, who they're trying to reach?	CHITCHAT
Are they trying to have art directors see their work because they want to get hired for a company?	CHITCHAT
Are they trying to sell their prints to individuals?	CHITCHAT
Then they might be looking at a different demographic of people that are interested in buying decorations for their home.	CHITCHAT
That could be a very wide range of people, so it depends on what you're trying to achieve with your art and whether you're trying to sell something or just.	CHITCHAT
Show off your portfolio for a job.	CHITCHAT
That will really change.	CHITCHAT
Maybe your your audience that your ideal.	CHITCHAT
Audience and I don't know that I can give any specific answer other than you know it's something good to think about an.	CHITCHAT
It might change overtime.	CHITCHAT
But so much of this is trial and error, and it's good to watch videos.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of YouTube videos about these topics with people that are much more knowledgeable specifically about that than me because I have a relatively small following compared to some of the larger creators with like hundreds of thousands of followers, and you can find videos from those types of creators.	CHITCHAT
On YouTube, maybe they'd have better advice 'cause I'm kind of still on my way trying to also figure out these things.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy to share what I've learned up to this point.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Monir says target audience is what type of people do you want to your posts to reach?	CHITCHAT
OK, I understand I understand, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I get what targeted audience means, but I wasn't understanding his question, but I think I think we got it now.	CHITCHAT
I hope I hope we were able to answer it.	CHITCHAT
Answer it a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I really like these tree shapes.	O
They're fun to make little bends and turns in them.	O
So I have the trees on one layer right now, so I'm going to go back to each tree and give a little bit of more detail to each individual tree while they're on their own layer.	O
I find it easiest to do this.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
While they're on their own layer, I can go in and.	O
Push the lock transparency.	O
Right here.	O
You just press this button.	O
The little checkerboard icon.	O
Now you're able to paint easily within the lines.	O
Be scenes as I think you most mostly need to figure out what you want to do, because if you change in the name of an audience, chances are you will no longer take pleasure in doing it.	CHITCHAT
I think that is good advice in the most important thing is that you're doing what you want to do with your art, an marketing and all that is important too, of course.	CHITCHAT
But I agree that you kind of want to decide what you want to do and then figure out how to market that rather than changing what you're doing to fit in with marketing.	CHITCHAT
OK, let me check it out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah I know what you mean about Instagram is not super landscape painting friendly.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that came out really nice.	O
What a pretty scene.	CHITCHAT
I wish I could make it bigger.	O
Beautiful, the lighting looks great.	O
Strong shapes, I like that you added the butterfly was that there.	O
I don't remember there being a butterfly.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I just missed it but.	CHITCHAT
Very good vibes.	CHITCHAT
Hey Graphics.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to brighten up the.	O

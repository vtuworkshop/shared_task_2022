Tree a little bit.	O
Adding bounces lay on the left and right.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
So these trees in the back should be a little bit extra dark and then.	O
We can add this medium Brown as a highlight because they're so dark will actually be able to.	O
See that color?	CHITCHAT
Is definitely a challenge organizing the shading this way.	O
If I'm painting with more of a digital type of Workflow.	O
Rather than imitating my traditional painting, I find it's a little easier to paint with gradients and things.	O
Rather than what I'm doing here, but hopefully the extra challenge will be worth it.	O
Hi Christopher, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome, I hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
If you or anyone wants to take a look at the reference image that I'm painting from.	CHITCHAT
You can find it below the stream as usual in the stream description.	CHITCHAT
Season says maybe silly question, but how do you decide on what size to make your artboard when you're starting out?	CHITCHAT
OK, so it's not silly.	CHITCHAT
I'm a little bit all over the place with this, so it kind of depends on the situation.	CHITCHAT
So if I'm making a quick study and it's just going to be something that I show online an I might not ever make a print of it.	O
If I'm pretty sure I'm not going to print it and it's just something that I might post later on Instagram and I'm just doing it for a quick study practice, I'll make the image pretty small.	O
It'll be easier for me to work with.	O
Less lag on your computer.	O
You know it's just easier less.	O
Less problems all around smaller file so I will in that case paint around 2015 hundred pixels.	O
Something like that, but if I feel like it's an image that I really like, even if it's just a study.	O
If I feel like there's any chance that I might want to make a print of it, I will consider making it a little bit bigger from the start, like this one is 2000 by 3000 pixels.	O
It's big enough to make a small print if I end up really liking this one just because I was a big fan of the setting.	O
If I'm painting something that I want to definitely want to print that I'm going to make it much larger from the start.	O
Maybe a minimum of like 5000 by 7000 pixels, and you know I'll be working in 300 DPI from the start.	O
Usually the ones that I'm only ever planning to share on the web, I'll just paint those at 72.	O
Hi Kelly, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, not a math crunchy 1 honey.	CHITCHAT
I was I was searching and I just didn't find anything that really.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't feeling it, you know?	CHITCHAT
I wanted one with like the just the perfect kind of lighting and I wasn't finding it, so I decided to find one from Unsplash.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we're finally going to add some some trees leaves.	O
Perhaps OK, good.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to put the color dynamics on my brush so that it's going to give a little bit of huge jitter.	O
It might not be much.	O
But the idea is as I'm painting.	O
It's giving us light striping effect to the brush.	O
It's kind of hard to see, but it is there.	O
Yes, it graphics, so I've so far I painted this whole scene in photo shop from the start.	O
So I didn't begin with a traditional sketch or anything like that.	O
For example, this was all done in photo shop.	O
If you're interested in seeing it from the start later after the stream is over, it's you can always find the replay if you go to my profile here on be hands and go to the videos tab, all of my past livestreams are there, so if there's if you wanted to see it from the start you can find it there.

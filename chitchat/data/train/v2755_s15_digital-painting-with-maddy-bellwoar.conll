But yes, I'm using photo shop and the whole thing has been done in here so far.	O
I really enjoy painting in Photoshop.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this tree as we're getting closer to us, this tree is going to be.	O
It's actually a little is it a different type of tree?	O
I'll know they're the same, the same type of tree, but the they just this one that's closer to us is getting.	O
Hit by light very brightly so its leaves look more green, more bright green, yellow green color.	O
Even so, it's nice to have a little variation, some medium and dark green deeper in the tree, and then the lights on the outside.	O
Hi Pearl, how long will it take you to finish when painting?	CHITCHAT
By the way, it's very nice.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
It depends on the painting for what the type of thing I'm doing right now.	CHITCHAT
My goal is to spend around 3 hours on this.	CHITCHAT
I started about an hour and.	CHITCHAT
10 minutes ago.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so an hour in 10 hour and 15 minutes ago so.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping in like 2 more hours I can finish the painting now that's not going to be a super super polished detailed painting.	CHITCHAT
It's more of a study an hopefully it's going to look nice at the end still, but it's not going to be like super super polished if I want to Polish a work up then I can take a lot more time on it anywhere from like.	CHITCHAT
Aids 1220 or 30 hours for detailed illustration with characters and things like that in the background, but for something like this, I'm going to try to do it in about 3 hours.	CHITCHAT
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
We'll see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
I'm drinking tea.	CHITCHAT
I'm drinking tea right now.	CHITCHAT
Green tea with honey.	CHITCHAT
So I first painted the.	O
The tree trunks then behind the layer of the tree trunks I painted.	O
The first layer of foliage, but now I'm going to go on top because I want the tree trunks to feel like very covered by the leaves.	O
Thank you thanks Christopher.	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, I really like this scene.	CHITCHAT
It's really, really pretty reference, so.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of things that I like about the lighting, and I hope that I can really make those things pop out in a more dramatic way in my painting by the end.	O
I like both tea and coffee, but I'm drinking.	CHITCHAT
I'm drinking tea.	CHITCHAT
So I really like this blue bounce light that's on the tree back here.	O
I don't know if you guys can see, but what I'm working on right now, it's like.	CHITCHAT
Blue teal color on some of the leaves in the references.	O
Bit small, but.	O
It's really really beautiful effect and.	O
When the leaves aren't getting direct light hitting them, but there's a little bit of light.	O
Light blue bounce light from the Sky or the surroundings bouncing off the leaves so pretty.	O
And then it's nice to kind of contrast that with a more yellow green where the sun is directly hitting.	O
Hi Merlin, I have a Wakeham Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
So I do have a screen tablet an I'm using the stylus right on the screen so I can see my artwork there.	CHITCHAT
But there's a lot of different types of tablets out there.	CHITCHAT
You certainly don't have to have this exact one.	CHITCHAT
So there's lots of different options, lots more affordable options coming out these days.	CHITCHAT
Which is nice.	CHITCHAT
If you guys are looking for any.	CHITCHAT
Information about purchasing tablets or finding good ones?	CHITCHAT
Stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
There's a link below my stream in the description that's for my resources page.	CHITCHAT
You should be able to find it down their resources and tutorials page that has a bunch of helpful links that I've compiled over the past years that I've been doing digital art.	CHITCHAT

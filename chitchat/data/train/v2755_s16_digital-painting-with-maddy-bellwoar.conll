The first section of that page has a link links to different tablet buying guides and reviews and things like that.	CHITCHAT
So if you're looking to get a tablet for the first time, you might want to check that out.	CHITCHAT
If you are kind of just getting into that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm gonna dark in the.	O
Tree branches a little bit, I'm just noticing in the reference these are really dark and almost just the silhouette back here.	O
For your left hand to use the tablet buttons or keyboard or one of the specialized keyboard things, I have always been a fan of just using the regular old keyboard shortcuts, so that's what I'm using.	CHITCHAT
The tablet that I'm using now, they actually they welcome centriq 22 HD used to have buttons on it.	CHITCHAT
Well it still does, but the gnu 22 does not have buttons so my tablet doesn't have any buttons on it.	CHITCHAT
Even if I wanted them.	CHITCHAT
But Luckily I don't.	CHITCHAT
I'm fine with the keyboard, I prefer the keyboard because.	CHITCHAT
It always stays the same and I'm used to it.	CHITCHAT
I don't have to.	CHITCHAT
Worry about it changing.	CHITCHAT
I'm that was one thing I was worried about and getting used to the tablet keys.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes the different changes to the models of the tablets and I was kind of worried about having to relearn my keyboard shortcuts.	CHITCHAT
So I decided to.	CHITCHAT
Stick with the keyboard, but hey, you got to do what's right for you.	CHITCHAT
What feels comfortable, that's super important.	CHITCHAT
You have to be comfortable while you're working, so there's no real right or wrong way to do the keyboard shortcuts.	CHITCHAT
As long as you.	CHITCHAT
Personalize them to yourself.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you uninvolved.	CHITCHAT
This very nice of you, thanks.	CHITCHAT
I'm just rearranging my tree is a little bit from the original position.	O
I want.	CHITCHAT
I want this one in the back to be a little bit lower.	O
I think too.	CHITCHAT
I think I could have just lowered all of them.	O
OK, I'm going to merge my trees so now my trees are all on one layer and then I'll just keep painting from here.	O
Hail avenged how's your day going?	CHITCHAT
OK, so a little bit of shadows and deeper part of this tree again to give dimension.	O
So we definitely want some dark green here and then we want to move up into more of a yellow green where the light is hitting.	O
And I'm using a brush that's creating a leaf texture, but I might go on top of this after I let the brush kind of block things in for me and get some of the some of the look of this detail.	O
I'm probably going to go in and do some of my own leaves too.	O
Are using new brush presets.	O
Yeah, I'm using some custom.	O
I'm working on creating a custom brush set so I've made these brushes myself.	O
The ones I'm using right now and I'm kind of testing them out so I can't show these ones yet.	O
There still kind of being tweaked, but I do have a brush that you can download for free below in the description if you're interested.	O
Up to this point of me creating the brush that I'm working on now that was like my main brush set I've been using for the past.	O
I don't know over a year.	CHITCHAT
So there's a lot of good brushes there too, if you are interested in trying them out, but the ones I'm using today will be available in the future.	CHITCHAT
I pay you $1,000,000.	CHITCHAT
Don't worry all they'll be much less expensive than that, but I just need to finish finish them up.	CHITCHAT
Make sure they're all working good and I want to release a brush pack with them so there's a few more that I want to create an include, but it's going well so far.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Ricardo.	CHITCHAT
Welcome back gene.	CHITCHAT
Well, I hope you guys are doing well.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining again.	CHITCHAT
But the goal of these brushes that I'm making here are to kind of imitate a little bit more of traditional painting textures.	O

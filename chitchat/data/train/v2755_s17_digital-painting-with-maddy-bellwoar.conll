And hopefully just to be fun to use.	CHITCHAT
That's something I really want.	CHITCHAT
I like to make brushes that are like really fun to paint with and not difficult or tricky.	CHITCHAT
'cause I.	CHITCHAT
I just want to relax, have a more relaxing painting process.	CHITCHAT
Would you like to paint any photo street?	CHITCHAT
I usually like to pick the photos for myself.	CHITCHAT
I have a little bit of certain tastes of what I like to paint, so I usually choose them.	CHITCHAT
If you are a photographer and you like to share your work, if you're interested in joining my discord community, I'll put a link in the chat.	CHITCHAT
For that, there's areas in there that you can share your art, whether your photographer or painter.	CHITCHAT
Whatever you do.	CHITCHAT
If you'd like to share, you can post it in there if you're interested.	CHITCHAT
No pressure, of course.	CHITCHAT
Do you have a YouTube channel?	CHITCHAT
No I don't.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
I mean I do have a YouTube account.	CHITCHAT
But I don't.	CHITCHAT
I haven't uploaded any videos to the channel.	CHITCHAT
I had a couple on there like years and years ago, but I just don't have time to make videos for YouTube.	CHITCHAT
I do a lot of live streaming if you're interested in seeing any past videos of my streams, like when I'm not live, you can check the.	CHITCHAT
You can check my page and my profile.	CHITCHAT
There's a videos tab and there you can see any past livestreams and you can kind of Fast forward through him to get through parts you're interested in, so that's the best thing I have where you the great thing about watching past streams here on Behance as they have a tool timeline.	CHITCHAT
This is running while I'm streaming so it's capturing information about the tools that I'm using as I'm using them, so if I'm going a little faster if there's something I'm doing you're curious about we can always ask me in the chat, but.	CHITCHAT
You can also watch the stream later.	CHITCHAT
In the replay you'll be able to see information along with the stream next to it about what tools I'm using and that might be easier.	CHITCHAT
Depending on how you like to visualize things.	CHITCHAT
OK, I want to move down to the random plants and.	O
Things down here under the trees so I didn't merge the trees down yet, which is good 'cause I need to paint underneath of that layer.	O
It's going to be a lot easier.	O
Like this, so a bunch of these trees back here have kind of a similar texture to them.	O
We can go a little bit a little bit later Green on top of these.	O
Darker Green Shadows.	O
A little bit of a cool teal reflecting off.	O
And there's a little plant over here.	O
Will just leave it for now with these dots.	O
Appeared there's some plants in a pot hanging down.	O
Well, if any of you are painting along, I hope it's going well and you're enjoying your painting.	CHITCHAT
I feel like right now we're getting to the stage in mind, that's like.	CHITCHAT
A little bit that awkward stage when you're working on a painting where a lot of things are blocked in, but then other things aren't, so it's kind of.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's just I feel like it's a little hard sometimes to visualize when you get into this certain phase.	CHITCHAT
How to get to the end?	CHITCHAT
From here, there's still like a lot that needs to be done.	CHITCHAT
But we're just going to keep going.	CHITCHAT
We will get there.	CHITCHAT
Thank you honey, you're so sweet.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good I'm I've still got mighty here.	CHITCHAT
I should be able to make it through the painting.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if we'll do a second one today, but.	CHITCHAT
Should be alright.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we're going to put in some little plant pots down here in the background.	O
Just going to choose.	O
Hopefully a good brush for that.	O
This little Terra cotta pots.	O
Take that back here and we want to put a little bit of warmer, lighter color.	O
Top.	O
So again, I'm trying to visualize this more as a traditional painting.	O
So it's OK if everything isn't very, very precise, and if you can see individual paint strokes and things like that.	O

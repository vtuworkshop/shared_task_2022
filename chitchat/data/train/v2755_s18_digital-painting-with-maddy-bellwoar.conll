Then I'm actually I would be happy about that.	CHITCHAT
So I still want it to look.	O
Somewhat realistic in that you see this scene, you can tell what it is and what's going on, and you know these are flower pots and windows and doors and trees.	O
You know we want to have that level of.	O
Realism that you can understand the scene, but other than that I'm happy if it looks more like a painting and it's OK for us to see individual brush strokes and.	O
For stuff not to be super, super precisely painted.	O
And maybe we can add some little things like it's trial and error, but maybe you had like a little pot down here.	O
You know we could add or take away things.	O
We don't have to follow the reference exactly.	O
We might be able to make some changes that improve it based on our tastes.	O
Hi Isabella, welcome.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Little pot here.	O
And it's starting to look cute.	O
Flower pots always make a scene nice and cheerful.	O
Hi Everson.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
OK, so we've got our furthest flower pots now there's another flower over on the side which I think we don't really see.	O
The pot we just kind of see a plant coming in from from the side.	O
I think that's fine.	CHITCHAT
Nice, I'm glad you could join us.	CHITCHAT
Let's see the difference between this and this.	O
I think is enough, will make a new layer.	O
I'm trying to keep some things on different layers so I can kind of create a little step by step from this.	O
So I think it's going OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's get some more yellow green leaves over here.	O
See if I can give this plan to more specific shape.	O
I really like in the reference how you can tell the individual little branches reaching out an.	O
Kind of dispersing.	O
There's also a window back there.	O
I probably should paint that window in before we cover it with plants.	O
It's a pretty one.	O
More of a red color.	O
OK, so you guys might know this already, but in case you don't this is a fun, very useful trick if you hold if you make a dot and then you hold shift and make another dot it will make a straight line between those two dots.	O
So that's one way to make up for me to make a nice precise shape for this window back here.	O
If I feel like I can't draw a perfectly straight line.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Can go back in and.	CHITCHAT
Paint normally.	O
Might lower the opacity a little bit so it fits in better.	O
Seems a little bit dark and was attracting my attention very much.	O
Kinda just wanted to be a nice little background detail.	CHITCHAT
I think maybe I made it too big.	O
This is the advantage of doing things on separate layers.	O
Even though I want the painterly approach, it's nice to be able to just quickly fix that and not have it have been painted right on.	CHITCHAT
2.	CHITCHAT
The wall let's put this.	CHITCHAT
And I like that detail outside of the window too.	CHITCHAT
Gotta be careful getting into these details, but let's do it.	O
Going to Trader.	CHITCHAT
Draw straight line so it comes something like this.	O
OK, it's not.	CHITCHAT
Exactly.	CHITCHAT
But I like it.	CHITCHAT

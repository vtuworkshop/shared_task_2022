That'll work.	CHITCHAT
That'll work.	CHITCHAT
So because that's on its own layer, we can do our lock transparency and grab another color and give a little bit of.	O
Highlight or shading to make this more 3 dimensional.	O
If you see fit, I think in the reference it's a little bit.	O
Lighter in some areas so.	O
Works for me.	CHITCHAT
The last thing is, there's a little bit of like an iron bar going across the window, and it has a nice little pattern to it.	O
So let's see if we can get that in.	CHITCHAT
And it's got some larger bars it split into thirds.	O
And then within that.	O
Thinner ones.	O
To try to find the right amounts, I don't want to cover it completely with bars.	O
Yeah, that's OK.	CHITCHAT
So we can go to image, adjust Hue, saturation.	O
I think I want to lighten this or give it a little bit of a different color.	O
Unlock the transparency and go back in with some shadows.	O
To make it look a little bit more 3D.	O
OK, so I think I'm going to merge those together and just commit to it and will go on so.	O
Let's do it.	CHITCHAT
It's part of the wall.	O
Now you guys.	CHITCHAT
It's not perfectly even, but it's OK.	O
It's an old building.	O
Things can be, some things can be in an even.	O
From now on, I'll be able to just pay on top of that.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hi Satish, thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
So I know this particular scene has a lot of detail, is a bit of a complicated one, but not all the scenes that I paint on the stream are have so much going on.	CHITCHAT
You guys are always welcome to paint with me.	CHITCHAT
If you feel like this one is a bit much, maybe maybe next Wednesday would be a can pick something a little less.	CHITCHAT
Detailed.	CHITCHAT
But I was enjoy happy guys painting and sketching with me, so you're welcome to join if you want.	CHITCHAT
Anytime.	CHITCHAT
I think season thank you.	CHITCHAT
Realistically, this plant is kind of coming from the side.	O
Really bro near that is such an honor.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you for being here.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for like making an effort to be here.	CHITCHAT
That's really nice to hear.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate the company.	CHITCHAT
It's nice to hang out with you guys, find it very relaxing to do these and a fun puzzle to figure out how to.	CHITCHAT
How to illustrate them.	CHITCHAT
I've been working on experimenting with some different stylization for my cell phone.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of a little bit new to me over the past months trying to explore the kind of traditional painting style with my digital work, so it's taking a lot of trial and error testing out different things and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's nice to talk about it and think about it and hang out with you guys and I'm happy to like teach my approach.	CHITCHAT
But it's also a little trial and error as I go through here, so it's not always a linear teaching.	CHITCHAT
But you can always ask me if you have any questions about what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I like what I did.	CHITCHAT
There might erase out a little bit.	O
We'll come back to it.	O
So I want to work on the floor a little bit.	O
The ground.	CHITCHAT
Right now it feels like the trees are just.	O
Coming out of nowhere it that we need to give a little home for the trees we need to give them a nice little place to come out of the ground so it feels more planted.	O
It feels more.	O
Believable So it looks like they're coming out of these tiny little openings.	O
Little squares in the floor.	O
It's not a big space for them to come out of, but I guess it's enough.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Can see little opening.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
It makes such a difference, but beyond that the whole floor also needs a little bit more love, so there's sort of crisscross pattern.	O

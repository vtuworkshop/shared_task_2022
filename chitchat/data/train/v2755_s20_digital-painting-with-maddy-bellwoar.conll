And I don't know if that's gonna be too busy to busy and to kind of technical to get into.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we can just give like a texture.	O
To the floor without going so precise with the exact Criss cross pattern that exists there.	O
Stephanie says, do you ever have moments where you'd stare at a painting for minutes on end and try to figure out what to do next?	CHITCHAT
Your painting so fluently.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I definitely feel that sometimes every once in awhile I'll do it on stream too, but.	CHITCHAT
I do know exactly what you're talking about, so for me more often like as I practice more and more, I feel like I get less of those moments, at least when I'm painting from.	CHITCHAT
From reference when I'm painting from reference, I get less of those moments because I feel like if I get when I look at the image, it gives me a lot more like OK.	CHITCHAT
I need to work on that part.	CHITCHAT
I kind of.	CHITCHAT
It's like it's like I can see it helps me see what to do next.	CHITCHAT
But when I'm painting an original scene and usually even wanna making original, senile have like an accumulation of references, I'll have a like a mood board or a reference board with multiple different ones.	CHITCHAT
And then you know, so I'm still using reference, but.	CHITCHAT
I'm not, I'm kind of creating a new thing from those instead of.	CHITCHAT
Recreating something that exists and those way more often get me into that situation where I'm like I can't visualize what am I doing next and I get like stuck a little bit and sometimes have to take a break, come back to it later and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, it depends on the type of illustration I'm doing when I'm doing studies and things I don't find it quite as problematic.	CHITCHAT
Usually when I'm working from one specific reference it's easier for me to follow.	CHITCHAT
Definitely make streaming quite stressful for me.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I get that you can always.	CHITCHAT
You can always ask chat you know like sometimes I'll be stuck and I'll say like, what do you guys think that can be?	CHITCHAT
That can be also that can backfire because sometimes then you'll get like 20 suggestions at once, and that can also be confusing, but chat is definitely giving me some good.	CHITCHAT
Suggestions before when I've been stuck, so as long as you get a few good suggestions and not like 50 then it's good.	CHITCHAT
Then it can help.	CHITCHAT
Reassuring awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yes, definitely definitely.	CHITCHAT
Um, let's see.	CHITCHAT
I think viewers wouldn't mind, especially if you narrate your thoughts.	CHITCHAT
That's a really good point hunji, like even when I do get confused, I tend to.	CHITCHAT
I tend to talk about why I'm confused.	CHITCHAT
You are really confused right now.	CHITCHAT
I can't decide what to do here there and that's still an interesting part of the process for people, I think.	CHITCHAT
I can find it interesting when I'm watching an artist to see like what they're struggling with and then how they kind of think through it.	CHITCHAT
So that's a good point.	CHITCHAT
Just talking about it.	CHITCHAT
PC and says well for me it's like Instagram.	CHITCHAT
If the viewers of board there free to go instead of thinking.	CHITCHAT
Jeez, I'm doing nothing.	CHITCHAT
People will get bored.	CHITCHAT
You can see it as people who have POV help you figure out your next move.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, that's a good point.	CHITCHAT
Not stress too much about it.	CHITCHAT
It's hard sometimes not to stress or overthink things, but.	CHITCHAT
You're probably right.	CHITCHAT
Hey Andy, how are you?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I like this effect.	O
I'm getting from the.	O
Ground with putting just a little bit of Kris Kross kind, it's extra.	O
I hope it's helping to look like these.	O
This pattern, but without getting too obsessed with it.	O
Hi, a sling more.	CHITCHAT
Happy Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So there is one thing that might be good to pay attention to, and that is as we as this pattern from the on the sidewalk or on the ground gets closer and closer to us.	O
It does get bigger and the panels in it get thicker and that helps show like distance and perspective because you know farther away all the way.	O
Over here we don't see that kind of detail, so I think that's helpful for someone looking at this.	O
Our viewers looking at our painting, it's going to make more sense if we allow that detailed to be.	O

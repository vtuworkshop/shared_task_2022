Less and less as it gets further away.	O
OK, I almost forgot that my trees were on a second layer.	O
I'm like carefully avoiding them, but I can just paint underneath.	O
Hi, I'm above thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for saying that you're very guys are very sweet.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate you hanging out with me and all the nice comments and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thank you for being here.	CHITCHAT
I haven't even begun with the table and chairs, so that's a little example of me procrastinating.	CHITCHAT
I think at some point I need to paint them in.	CHITCHAT
There's also a bicycle.	CHITCHAT
Those are going to be a little complicated for me.	CHITCHAT
I think I do want to paint the area around behind and underneath first, but I think we're getting to the point where it's time to start painting that in.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to keep a little record of the process so this is what we've done so far.	CHITCHAT
Is there so many layers for you?	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm only keeping these layers so that I can make a little process thing later.	O
I'm not actively using all of these so these are just layers of the progress of the painting I've been saving the past ones for reference to show later.	O
But at the moment I'm actually using two to three layers for my painting.	O
Yeah here let me show you the let me show you the bicycle.	O
There it is.	O
I wonder I might not include the bicycle my painting.	O
I think the focal point of the.	O
Table and chairs.	O
Hundreds like I don't see what I don't see one either.	CHITCHAT
I think the table and chairs are nice focal point.	O
The bicycle is partially covered by the chair and the.	O
I I don't think it's perfect.	CHITCHAT
I don't think it's perfect.	CHITCHAT
If anything, if I were going to redesign this, it might be nice if the bicycle was like on one of these trees back here.	O
It's a little cluttered over here.	O
So I think I'm just going to go with the.	O
Like either the table and chair evil, either just the bicycle or just the table and chairs, and I think the table and chairs are going to look nicer.	O
I don't know if you're the one to ask this, but is there a vacancy on this street?	CHITCHAT
Made out of cake with your painting, I want to move there.	CHITCHAT
I know I'm ready to go on vacation to this place.	CHITCHAT
I it's in Spain.	CHITCHAT
And Yeah, it looks beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, we're going to do we're on the same page.	CHITCHAT
Angie, we're on the same page.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's good to hear.	CHITCHAT
So you agree.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well let's.	CHITCHAT
Let's begin with the blocking in the table and chairs.	CHITCHAT
Actually, you know what I'm going to procrastinate even more.	CHITCHAT
But this is actually needed.	CHITCHAT
There's I want to get the lighting working below here before we put the table and chairs, because if you guys can see the table and chairs, most of it is a silhouette.	O
So the IT needs to have this pretty bright light on the wall behind it and then even some bounce light on the floor underneath the chairs.	O
This is also blowing a lot an I think it helps to show the table and chairs because then they look very dark compared to the.	O
The background and without that being dark.	O
Yeah, it's not going to make their shape pop out as much.	O
Wow, that is impressive.	CHITCHAT

That is impressive.	CHITCHAT
Stephanie.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I would have picked that out.	CHITCHAT
I think I might have guessed like Italy or something if I was.	CHITCHAT
If I was going to guess, I would've probably been wrong.	CHITCHAT
Well, I would have definitely been more so there you have it, but I also haven't been to Spain so I maybe if I had been there before I would have.	CHITCHAT
Been more likely to.	CHITCHAT
To recognize it, have you been in Istanbul?	CHITCHAT
I never have more near.	CHITCHAT
Maybe someday.	CHITCHAT
Well, the the.	CHITCHAT
The ground in my painting seems almost as if it's on a curve.	O
But maybe that's fine.	O
'cause this is a very old place.	O
Old buildings.	O
They can be.	CHITCHAT
Things can be a little crooked, right?	CHITCHAT
All right, so we're cleaning up a nice backdrop for our table and chairs to come in.	O
I think we're almost ready for it.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Ah, I can't.	CHITCHAT
We're saying about the bicycle.	CHITCHAT
But hey, you can always use it in your painting if you if you do one of the scene.	CHITCHAT
One of the things that I find interesting when we do these group studies and multiple people paint along is that.	CHITCHAT
Different people leave different things out.	CHITCHAT
Different people focus on different things in the image, something that's like a really key thing to another person is less important.	CHITCHAT
And that's an interesting thing.	CHITCHAT
The entire artist interpretation.	CHITCHAT
If we have extra time, we can consider adding the bicycle, but.	CHITCHAT
To me it's less important than the other things.	CHITCHAT
To me, and there's a lot going on in this scene.	CHITCHAT
Very busy, so I'm going to prioritize the other things first, and then maybe we can add the bike.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so we have one chair.	O
Table.	O
So pro designer, if you open the link below this stream the.	CHITCHAT
The photographer did tagged this as Santa Cruz.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know if there's a more specific location.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you're looking for more specific about like the exact like cafe or something like that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if we're going to know.	CHITCHAT
We're going to know that specifically, but the photographer I gave a good amount of location information there.	CHITCHAT
I have not been to India.	CHITCHAT
I've been too well.	CHITCHAT
I'm from the United States.	CHITCHAT
I've been to I live in the Netherlands and I've been to Belgium, Germany and.	CHITCHAT
Italy, but other than that I haven't been through.	CHITCHAT
Many haven't been to other countries.	CHITCHAT
I've been to Canada.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I would love to do more world traveling.	CHITCHAT
In the future.	CHITCHAT
Hi Marissa, how are you?	CHITCHAT
So there's two tables next to each other, so we're going to get.	O
Drinking in both in there.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put them closer together.	O
I think I might actually turn on smoothing on my brush.	O
I feel like I'm making very.	O
Wobbly brushstrokes right now.	O
With these little details.	O
I'm going to try to stay pretty relaxed about these details on painting in right now.	O

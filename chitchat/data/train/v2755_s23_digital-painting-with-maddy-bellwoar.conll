And I do want everything to look believable enough, so I don't want anything to be super super wonky, but I'm going to try to stay loose and be OK with the fact that this is going to be again.	O
I'm were considered more concerned with the mood in the lighting in the scene rather than things being like super, super realistic.	O
I wanted to look like a painting.	O
So not not going for photo realism.	O
I want to try again at the second table.	O
I notice that I made them look too too matchy.	O
Matchy couldn't give a slightly different angle to this one I think so they don't look so identical.	O
That's a little better.	O
At least there's a little more space between them.	O
Alright, the tables are really pretty, they have.	CHITCHAT
And this shine.	O
You can see the.	O
Reflection of light on the top of the tables.	O
So I want to get that affect in mind too, so I'm going to finish them off.	O
And then we'll add a little highlight.	O
Hopefully it will be.	CHITCHAT
Satisfying, I find highlights like some of the most fun of the whole painting process.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we've got our tables.	O
We can lock the transparency with the checkerboard icon and pick a darker Brown and add a little bit of shadow like underneath the top of the table that first.	O
Maybe a little bit of shadow right there, so it's a little darker right underneath the very top.	O
And also.	CHITCHAT
We can give some shading to the individual legs if we want.	O
It would be so nice, Susan, I would really go for that right now sitting at one of these tables having a cup of coffee, reading a book or chatting or sketching or just sitting and enjoying the beautiful location.	CHITCHAT
That would definitely love that.	CHITCHAT
It's one of the reasons I like painting places like this is.	CHITCHAT
It's a big.	CHITCHAT
Painting relaxing scenes if they just make me feel good to look at and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, they make me happy to paint and give a lot of good vibes.	CHITCHAT
I hope you know as an artist and I also make traditional art and soul.	CHITCHAT
My traditional paintings and I hope when people buy my artwork and have it in there.	CHITCHAT
In their home that it makes them feel happy and gives those kind of feelings of like remembering being an application somewhere or just some nice feeling like that's what I like in, uh, there's different purposes to artwork.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you make art because it's you know.	CHITCHAT
Artwork can be advertising.	CHITCHAT
Artwork can be.	CHITCHAT
You can be giving a message with your art.	CHITCHAT
There's so many different things, but for me a lot of what I like to do with my art is just create pieces that give good feeling and make people feel happy when they see them.	CHITCHAT
And so I like landscapes with a nice feeling and sometimes with like a nastalgic feeling, nice lighting and things like that.	CHITCHAT
This is what I'm attracted to when I make art.	CHITCHAT
Four months of winter here.	CHITCHAT
Until we have a nice sitting out weather.	CHITCHAT
Ryan, you guys are really got a ways to go.	CHITCHAT
Still four months I think here in here in the Netherlands it's getting warmer.	CHITCHAT
I think it'll be another month or two before it's like.	CHITCHAT
Warm But it's already.	CHITCHAT
It's already improving slightly.	CHITCHAT
High paying welcome.	CHITCHAT
Pretty sure it's in front of the Legato Alcazar Hotel.	CHITCHAT
How did you find that?	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, it would be so cool to go stay there after having painted this already that would be wild.	CHITCHAT
I could actually do a painting there in person.	CHITCHAT
Maybe someday.	CHITCHAT
Maybe someday it's a future.	CHITCHAT
Future travel destination.	CHITCHAT
Cool well I don't know how you found it or if you've been there but.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for sharing.	CHITCHAT
Wow, really Marissa?	CHITCHAT
Is that unusual for this time of year?	CHITCHAT
That sounds really intense.	CHITCHAT
It's getting colder here in Edinburg, oh.	CHITCHAT
I I felt a little bit of that here in the Netherlands, like we had a very strange January which was really warmer than usual and felt like we were already going right into spring and then it did get colder again and I was like, no, you're going the wrong way.	CHITCHAT

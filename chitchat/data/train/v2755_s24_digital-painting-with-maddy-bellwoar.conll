But Now it seems like.	CHITCHAT
Going getting a little warmer again.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I can understand that right?	CHITCHAT
Everyone's like getting in their bathing suits.	CHITCHAT
Wow, that is intense.	CHITCHAT
So I'm adding a little bit more shading underneath the.	O
Table and chairs.	O
There's going to be shadows right below each individual little foot and stuff like that.	O
So we can put these little marks.	O
Also, there's another chair, so I shouldn't be getting too carried away.	O
I might have to move things.	O
Don't know what the norm is.	CHITCHAT
I've only been in Austin for six months.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I see move from Indiana.	CHITCHAT
Well, I hope you're liking it.	CHITCHAT
I lived in Florida for most of my life, so I was used to it being pretty hot alot of the year and not having two too much in the way of seasons.	CHITCHAT
It sounds like it's pretty pretty warm where you are too.	CHITCHAT
There can be advantages and disadvantages to that.	CHITCHAT
I definitely miss.	CHITCHAT
A higher average of sunny days.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of cloudy and rainy days where I live now in comparison.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I get a little tired of it, sometimes it can be cozy, but.	CHITCHAT
After a while you want to see the sun.	CHITCHAT
I haven't used fresco, Steven.	CHITCHAT
I've I've heard some good things about it, and I've seen some really nice art created in the program.	CHITCHAT
I like that I really like the idea of the traditional texture, since that's something that I'm really trying to get in my work.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, just haven't tried it yet.	CHITCHAT
I have a bunch of.	CHITCHAT
I feel like.	CHITCHAT
I have enough on my hands at the moment.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it maybe at some point if I start to feel at all like stale with what I'm doing then I like to mix it up trying a new medium or new.	CHITCHAT
New technique or something like that, but at the moment the flick I've got a lot on my hands as part of the reason I haven't tried fresco yet.	CHITCHAT
Sadly, we do jump from a very warm spring, so hot summer.	CHITCHAT
Trying to remember which what's on what layer we're going to have to merge soon, so too many layers for my liking, but I feel like it's a lot easier to paint this what I'm doing it right now.	O
If I keep things separate temporarily until the chairs blocked in everything is blocked in then will merge it all.	O
Mr.	CHITCHAT
Since during the winter I have the Heat in Texas, I just got a dog being able to take her on walks every day.	CHITCHAT
It's been really nice not looking forward to the summer though.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's going to be really warm.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that was the same for me.	CHITCHAT
Was that most of the time the Florida weather in the winter is pretty nice.	CHITCHAT
Like cool like warm but with some cool breeze, not too hot.	CHITCHAT
Fall and winter are the best year.	CHITCHAT
Was waiting in winter to snow here in Istanbul, but unfortunately it's not same for me.	CHITCHAT
It didn't snow where I live in the Netherlands and I think I think that some part of the country got snow, but it wasn't where I am.	CHITCHAT
And it was just a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, it was like a one day thing and it melted pretty quick.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, it was like not a real winter.	CHITCHAT
Alright, so I'm giving a little little tiny.	O
Dots to the.	O
The top and the bottom of the chair to make it feel a little bit more.	O
Grounded.	O
Now in the reference, there's two more chairs.	O
One is behind here.	O
Behind the other one and one is a little further down.	O
This is the type of stuff that I honestly find a little tedious to do, like I.	CHITCHAT

Of the whole painting.	CHITCHAT
This is the part that I'm kind of like.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I have to sort of use my.	CHITCHAT
Discipline a little bit more to get through this part and get into the areas that I'm more interested in painting, but.	CHITCHAT
Gotta do it if we want to paint the rest of the scene.	CHITCHAT
We gotta paint these chairs.	O
It's a little bit tedious.	CHITCHAT
But it'll be worth it.	CHITCHAT
All right, we've got one back here.	O
I'm trying to keep them roughly in the right.	O
Um proportions to each other so that it feels like they are the same size and belong at the same table.	O
Resize this one.	O
We gotta put little cushions and then we should be good to go.	O
That's a nice red cushions on the chairs, although we could change different colors and have to be read, but I think the colour works is pretty classic.	O
Sorry, my neighbors outside making some noise, so I hope it's not too annoying for you guys.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to put all the chairs on one layer.	O
Actually this one I can't 'cause it's in front of the others.	O
But let's begin with the little cushions.	O
So the cushions show a lot of they have a big.	O
3D kind of quality to them because they have a dark shadow on the bottom and then the area that's being hit by light is quite a bit brighter and more pink, so it's really pretty and makes the cushions really have a 3D kind of pop to them.	O
So I'm starting with the darker color.	O
And then we will pick something later still, like a red color.	O
And that's not it.	O
So it.	CHITCHAT
Start for 2 hours and just melted ha.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of what happened here, although it didn't snow in my area, but in the South part of the Netherlands, it seems like it snowed in.	CHITCHAT
In Belgium.	CHITCHAT
It snowed for a little bit and then didn't last very long so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Maybe next year.	CHITCHAT
I know some of you are living in places where it's noted time that you probably like.	CHITCHAT
Quit complaining, but I was just hoping to take some reference pictures in the snow for painting, so that's why I was.	CHITCHAT
I was really hoping for it.	CHITCHAT
All right, and the chairs also have these little.	O
Weaved.	O
Pieces supports in the back that are really pretty and there like this tan color.	O
I guess I should just probably paint a solid color for that.	O
Trying to decide how to approach this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to undo that.	O
It snowed in Austin for bits and melted.	CHITCHAT
Everyone was freaking out so I guess it doesn't.	CHITCHAT
Usually snow there then.	CHITCHAT
I bet.	CHITCHAT
It's always fun for kids.	CHITCHAT
In that case they may have not seen it.	CHITCHAT
Very much before.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to paint this in a solid color.	O
The backs of the chairs.	O
Get the weave pattern in there.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
There's some places where the light is hitting these iron chairs, and we get a different colour reflecting off of them like a.	O
Bright Green Gray, Green, Blue.	O

I don't know see if we can find the right color.	CHITCHAT
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
So the lights heading here.	O
I want to make sure that it.	CHITCHAT
Shows up that way.	O
And we can also choose, you know 'cause.	O
With artists in the situation, you can choose to add a little extra light somewhere that it doesn't actually exist.	O
If you really want to draw attention to some area, you can choose to make that your focal point.	O
All you need to do is.	O
You know, maybe add a little bit more of a pop of light there.	O
You like the chairs, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Well then they were worth the effort.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, Suzanne, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Add a little more highlight up at the top.	O
The chairs have been extra little detail in them, but I think I'm going to keep it simple for now because at this rate the painting is going to go very slow, so I'm going to merge them together.	O
So now I have this all together as one.	O
And I think I like overall the position of the chairs and everything.	O
It's not identical to the reference, it's a little bit.	O
Bigger.	O
Can make it a little smaller and closer to the tree.	O
Look like 3D chairs.	O
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm glad that they look.	CHITCHAT
Believable 3D Wise.	CHITCHAT
The shadow side of the of the chairs is.	O
On the right, in this case, away from the wall, where we get a lot of bounce light so I can add a little extra shadow on the.	O
Chairs facing that side, we want to make them.	O
A little bit more 3D.	O
So I want to work on the area behind the chair is a little bit and I think it might be finally time to get into some specific shapes of these leaves on the walls and things like that.	O
So I'm going to take the same brush that I used to actually paint the leaves on the trees or one of the one of the brushes and use that to paint the leaf pattern on the wall and we'll see how it goes.	O
It might be a little bit too.	O
Specific because with this situation, the dappled lighting off, then you'll see a like a blur effect.	O
It's not going to be like so so so perfectly precise, so we could use a blur filter.	O
That would be one way to do this, so I'm going to paint them in with this brush, just allowing them to be pretty crisp, and then let's try a blur filter and see if that looks good.	O
So basically going from the light towards dark and vice versa giving this look of specific little leaves.	O
On the wall.	O
Some color picking from the pink going into the.	O
The white and then back and forth.	O
I'm trying to make some interesting shapes here.	O
Takes a little trial and error.	CHITCHAT
All the way up here.	CHITCHAT
Glad I didn't merge the trees down yet.	O
'cause I can now paint behind the tree pretty easily still.	O
Appear there's tiny, tiny little flecks of light.	O
I really like it.	CHITCHAT
It's very pretty.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should have made the shadows even darker on the.	O
The wall, that way these light.	O
Patches would be even more dramatic.	O
But there might be something that we can edit.	O

OK, so I've done a bunch of leaves.	O
She let's raise this up a little bit.	O
Higher in the reference we see this end.	O
This Patch of lay end above the chair.	O
And then there's another.	CHITCHAT
Come down here.	CHITCHAT
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
It looks very messy, but let's see what we can do filter.	O
I'm going to go to blur and there's a lot of different blurs we can use, lens blur, gausian blur, motion blur can sometimes be good for this kind of thing.	O
If you put it at a very very low amount of motion.	O
I'm going to go for a Gaussian blur.	O
Thing.	CHITCHAT
Should the arm on the left be there?	O
Oh no, I need to cover that up.	O
Good catch.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is with a little bit of a blur filter.	O
I don't know if I really like it.	O
I think part of the reason is because we're taking.	O
We're kind of combining.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to take a traditional approach to painting this, so I guess putting like a photographic lens blur filter it could work, but it's not really taking it in the direction I'm trying to go in.	O
Where is our chairs?	CHITCHAT
OK yeah we need to.	CHITCHAT
Get rid of this OK.	O
Better.	O
OK, I'm going to get rid of that.	O
I'm going to do a lot of trial and error sometimes in a painting, so I'm going to try again with the.	O
Might be OK once you add more brightness.	O
Yeah, let's let's take a look at that, so I'm going to make a selection of this area.	O
And I will add an adjustment layer.	O
Let's look at the levels.	O
So now it's only adjusting that wall.	O
I think I want to just really bump up the contrast there.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should do that to the whole the whole image.	O
It definitely makes it feel brighter.	O
Definitely feel the light a little bit more intensely.	O
There's a couple places we might like that brighter light so.	O
Our result there.	CHITCHAT
The ground will get a little bit more of that balance late too.	O
This little bit of a glow.	O
Yeah, I definitely want to put a glow around it.	O
I think that'll be really satisfying to do.	CHITCHAT
So for me I have the tendency to.	O
To like painting the.	O
The shape and getting well in this case I think it would be nice to get like a clean shape for what I want with the patches of light.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Will add some.	CHITCHAT
Will add a little extra glow.	O
On top of that I think is going to be my plan.	O
Want to sit in this painting has some coffee.	CHITCHAT
It is like giving everyone that feeling me too me too.	CHITCHAT
I'm ready for cappuccino.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to paint with the image in black and white for a little bit.	O
I showed this earlier, but there's a shortcut that you can set up in Photoshop.	O
You just have to set it up once and it will always be there for you.	O
It turns it allows you to turn your painting quickly into black and white, and you can actually color pic and paint while you're painting is in.	O
This black and white.	O
Version and it's Super Super Handy.	O
So I think one of the things that I want to do is just real quick, like paint in this.	O
Black and white to fix some of my.	O

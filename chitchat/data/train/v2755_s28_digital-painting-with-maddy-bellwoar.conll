Values the shading dark to light shading wasn't working.	O
Perfectly here.	O
So we're going to paint them black and white for a couple moments and then take a look at it.	O
Ha ha oh you guys are sweet.	CHITCHAT
Well enjoy your coffee.	CHITCHAT
Awesome, good mood.	CHITCHAT
Definitely get moved.	CHITCHAT
Hi John Paul.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to brighten up a larger area and then we're going to come back with leaf shapes.	O
And cut into that area little bit.	O
I'm going to make this center bar a little bit smaller.	O
My proportions were a little bit off.	O
OK, let's go back alright, so here's the before and after before after.	O
Sometimes it really helps to turn it in black and white.	O
To get a fresh look.	O
But I do want to do some more work on this wall in general.	O
Getting there.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's it's getting a little better.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to try making a new layer.	O
We're going to put it on overlay.	O
And I will choose an airbrush.	O
And I want to brighten up the.	O
Even the shadows on the wall there just a little too dark, I think.	O
So I'm using overlay.	O
I'm going to choose a brighter maybe.	O
A warm orange.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Try to lighten up some area around the highlights.	O
Hey sorry please.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, I'm glad you liked the reference.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put a layer on lightning mode also and try that.	O
I just feel like.	CHITCHAT
Overall, I want the sunlight feeling to come through a lot more than it was.	O
So it may differ from the reference a little bit, but you know what?	CHITCHAT
This is our painting.	CHITCHAT
We gotta sometimes make choices like that.	CHITCHAT
Going to be able to fill a Freedom to make some artistic.	CHITCHAT
We can be art directors.	CHITCHAT
In our paintings.	CHITCHAT
So giving him a little bit more fantasy colors.	CHITCHAT
And I will merge those down.	O
So so if anybody is just getting here sour puss, I can go back in time and show you the start of this painting.	CHITCHAT
I've been saving the layers as we go so we can do a little.	O
Progress.	O
Yeah, so that's where we are right now.	O
So we can do layer and I want to work on the leaf shapes.	O
Let's get back to that.	O
But I haven't figured out how.	CHITCHAT
I might just have to kind of paint them by hand.	O
Just go in here and do this.	O
I was looking for a.	O
Magic.	O
Brush effect.	O
And maybe even a softer brush would be nice.	O
Alright, so just like we're bringing little white leaf shapes into the pink or bringing pinkley shapes into the white, just like you see in the reference, some of them are going to be separate from the group.	O

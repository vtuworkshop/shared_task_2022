So we're going to get some random little ones in here.	O
Stuff like that.	O
Thank you muneer.	CHITCHAT
Did you use religious for the chair?	CHITCHAT
They look very good.	CHITCHAT
Oh thanks.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad to hear that I didn't use anything special for the chairs.	CHITCHAT
Just just looking at the reference.	CHITCHAT
But they were a little bit tedious to do compared to the rest of the painting, which has been pretty fun.	CHITCHAT
I feel like the chairs were like I had kind of slow down and.	CHITCHAT
Get into the details there, but glad I'm glad it worked.	CHITCHAT
The references from Spain.	CHITCHAT
And I found it on Unsplash.	CHITCHAT
If you want to see the originals photographer, put the original photographers post.	CHITCHAT
There's a link below the stream description.	CHITCHAT
It's such a pretty such a pretty reference.	CHITCHAT
Thanks thanks Sir Plus.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if anybody.	CHITCHAT

Like the color.	CHITCHAT
Things to.	CHITCHAT
Yes, now I'm just using a basic round brush for these little highlights.	O
Collected for leader.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, good idea.	CHITCHAT
I've been keeping little little collections on Unsplash and.	CHITCHAT
Pixabay and pixels to use for painting reference and things like that.	CHITCHAT
It's nice, especially when.	CHITCHAT
There's a day where you want to work on something, but you just don't have any ideas.	CHITCHAT
You can go find something nice and just do a little study.	CHITCHAT
Olivier, thank you.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to do the same thing up here and.	O
Go back and forth with the leaf shapes.	O
There's a few places that need to do this.	O
I like this hot pink color.	O
It's really intense.	O
And the Orange.	O
Maybe it's a little too intense, but I like it.	O
So I'm sorry that I'm not explaining too much at the moment, I'm kind of doing the same thing over and over here, 'cause I'm just working on going back and forth with these little circles, so there's not too much to say about this.	CHITCHAT
But if you do happen, have any questions about anything or what I'm doing, you're welcome to ask.	CHITCHAT
Well, most through this step I think.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Good vibes well cheers.	CHITCHAT
Choose.	CHITCHAT
Drinking some tea over here.	CHITCHAT
Always have to have tea while painting or coffee.	CHITCHAT
Gotta have something nice.	CHITCHAT
From the relaxing painting session.	CHITCHAT
Love in your second version of the wall.	CHITCHAT
Happy and bright thanks.	CHITCHAT
I think it was I think is an improvement.	CHITCHAT
Had a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the shadows were a little too dark.	O
I mean, even though I think this is like brighter than the reference.	O
For some reason, I feel like it's working better.	O
Yeah, good spot.	CHITCHAT
Harry is the Starbucks Florida edition.	CHITCHAT
Kind of an older mug now.	CHITCHAT
Alright, we're gonna have a little plant coming in from the side looking at the chairs now compared with the light and everything next to it.	O

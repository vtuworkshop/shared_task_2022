I'm wondering if I need to make the shares a little bit brighter.	O
I'm wondering if I need to make them a little bit brighter.	CHITCHAT
Because it seems like now they feel really dark compared to the area that they were sitting in, and I don't know if that makes little sense.	O
They should be probably a little bit brighter.	O
Or at least like more contrast between the braids in the darks.	O
Hopefully that reads OK.	CHITCHAT
All.	CHITCHAT
On sorry gene pool, but I'm glad you're still watching and and learning something.	CHITCHAT
That's a great thing about stream, because honestly, I'm better at showing things than.	CHITCHAT
Then I explaining in a lot of words so.	CHITCHAT
Let's get at least we can.	CHITCHAT
We can see what's going on.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I find it a lot easier to.	CHITCHAT
Show what I what I mean with the visuals.	CHITCHAT
So there's a little sprinkling of light appear in the blue.	O
Hi Alma's, loving it.	CHITCHAT
Would you say your styles mix of realistic in watercolor feel?	CHITCHAT
Thanks I would love to describe it as that in traditional.	CHITCHAT
I'm a gouache painter that's just my favorite medium at the moment.	CHITCHAT
And I like watercolor too and gouaches water medium.	CHITCHAT
You know, it's a little bit different, but I think that's where a lot of the influences coming from.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to apply things that I am learning from traditional gouache medium, which I really love and bring some of those textures and effects into digital to give it a more traditional feeling so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I would say so and it's nice to hear if you are getting that impression.	CHITCHAT
Because I did digital painting before getting into traditional painting, I.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I it was easier for me to gravitate towards Gouache because you can paint the light colors over top of dark colors and things.	CHITCHAT
I tried to do some watercolor.	CHITCHAT
And I found it super super difficult because you have to really plan out everything and you can't.	CHITCHAT
Once you go to dark in an area, there's not too much you can do about it unless you're going to bring in another type of medium.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I notice that.	CHITCHAT
I think it has a little bit to do with my digital background that I prefer gouache.	CHITCHAT
For that ability.	CHITCHAT

He has some.	CHITCHAT
Really good books as well.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome if you see any similarity at all between us.	CHITCHAT
It's a big compliment, so thank you.	CHITCHAT
Halo Sama Welcome everybody, hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
So right now I'm working on the.	O
Not shadows, but the bounce light underneath the chairs.	O
There's some light reflecting off of the wall pretty brightly, so we're going to get the lights in and then we need some darks too because there is not only bright highlights but there's little shadows in little under the chair an with I guess there's little like garbage cans or something I don't know.	O
I'm not going to paint those in.	O
Are the chairs and tables going to have worse?	O
A slight drop shadows yes yes they will.	CHITCHAT
They need drop shadows right now.	O
They're not quite.	CHITCHAT
It's not quite selling me that, they're like, really.	O
Sitting there in the scene.	O
I mean, they're there, but they're not.	CHITCHAT
We need more evidence.	CHITCHAT
We need more shadows, I think yeah.	O
On the same page.	O
Alright, let's try it and see what we can do a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to flip for some reason.	O
I feel like it's going to be easier for me to do it from this angle, so flip the reference to.	O

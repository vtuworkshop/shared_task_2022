I'm gonna try to let myself just kind of sketch these in.	O
Maybe I'll switch back to a more textured brush and although we got through the leaf painting that I was kind of struggling with.	O
I have a brush that has like a canvas texture to it and it's kind of fun.	O
I'm not sure if it's like 2 too much for this, but.	CHITCHAT
The scene is so colorful, even the shadows here in the reference, the shadows have a really bright blue to them.	O
Of course I might be.	O
Exaggerating it a little bit, but.	O
Also over here on the ground there's a little bit more like teal.	O
Blue bounce light.	O
For those of you painting along as I think there's maybe at least one of you.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good time and enjoying your painting.	CHITCHAT
I'm curious where you're thinking of this one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's a lot of sort of crisscross overlapping going on the ground here.	O
I'm fighting against my urge to kind of make this more clean 'cause I don't want it to be overly clean.	O
I wanted to feel more like a painting and yet I still sometimes struggle to.	CHITCHAT
Allow things to be messy.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think.	CHITCHAT
I think we can move away from the table and chairs for a little bit.	O
And work on.	O
Some other areas of the painting.	O
I also think I'm going to merge the trees and everything.	O
Hopefully that's not going to be a big mistake.	CHITCHAT
So now we have these steps so far.	O
So first.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
2.	CHITCHAT
Some what's how it went down, so we'll go from here.	O
On a new layer one thing, but I haven't included yet or all the gates on the doors and everything.	O
So I can try to add those will see how it looks on a new layer.	O
So just a little.	CHITCHAT
A little detail, but I think.	O
It gives.	O
Some personality and you know it tells little about this place and.	O
Can I identifiable marker for different locations?	CHITCHAT
These kind of artistic?	CHITCHAT
Little accents.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
The architectural things.	CHITCHAT
There's going to be plants in front of these.	O
I think these might actually be windows rather than doors.	O
The ones I'm painting right now.	O
So they're going to be more plants on the ground in front covering, covering there a little bit.	O
Muneer says is it difficult to learn digital painting techniques like it appears in this Christmas winter elf posts?	CHITCHAT
So Meunier brought up one of my paintings.	CHITCHAT
This style is, I think popularly known as semi realistic style.	CHITCHAT
So if you're looking to find tutorials and things related to it, just look up semi realism.	CHITCHAT
There's there's one artist in particular that I learned a lot from her name is she goes by online sticky Meechan, so you may have heard of her.	CHITCHAT
She does a lot of pinups, character pinup, art and things, so I'm going to put the name in the chat.	CHITCHAT
So you can see how it's spelled.	CHITCHAT

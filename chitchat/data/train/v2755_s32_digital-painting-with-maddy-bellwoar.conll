She has a Patris on where she does tutorial videos and things an I subscribe to her Patreon for.	CHITCHAT
Like over a year earlier in my digital art journey and it was a really really big help to me.	CHITCHAT
In understanding how to do those particular, she has a lot of really good.	CHITCHAT
Ways to do that kind of illustration?	CHITCHAT
She works really quick.	CHITCHAT
She got a lot of efficient workflow that she does with those so.	CHITCHAT
You do have to.	CHITCHAT
It is like a subscription with Patris on so I think she might have a couple free videos on YouTube but it was really really worth the money for me even if you only subscribe for like one or two months you get a lot of videos each term.	CHITCHAT
So it's I thought it was like very good.	CHITCHAT
Content for the price.	CHITCHAT
So I would look for Sikimi Chan.	CHITCHAT
That's who I learned from on how to paint like that or just semi realist semi realism.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of tutorials out there from different artists so I'm sure you'll be able to find something.	CHITCHAT
And he said, is it difficult?	CHITCHAT
To learn.	CHITCHAT
It did.	CHITCHAT
It did take me awhile.	CHITCHAT
I did I did do a lot of paintings to get better with that, but.	CHITCHAT
I hadn't done really done something like it before, so it was.	CHITCHAT
I had to put in the time, it wasn't.	CHITCHAT
It wasn't super easy, but it you definitely.	CHITCHAT
Once you get through the early stages it does get easier.	CHITCHAT
It's like a little bit of gotta push through the tough beginning and then it's like OK, I'm starting to get it.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
It's it's worth the effort, but it wasn't super easy for me.	CHITCHAT
I definitely had to put in time to learn.	CHITCHAT
But her techniques make it a lot easier rather than trying to figure it all out yourself.	CHITCHAT
When you said Christmas elf, I was thinking of something completely different really.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah it's not.	CHITCHAT
Not not a silly Christmas love, but like a winter winter forest.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, she was.	CHITCHAT
She's more of like A.	CHITCHAT
Fantasy.	CHITCHAT
Fantasy character than like a holiday one, but I painted it around Christmas time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
I hope I hope it helps.	CHITCHAT
If you end up checking him out.	CHITCHAT
I really like these little swirly details supports on the building here.	O
Take a look at what time it is.	CHITCHAT
Who time is going fast?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Well, we're doing doing pretty well.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to.	CHITCHAT
Start pulling things together with this.	CHITCHAT
So we can work towards like the polishing and.	O
Finishing phase.	O
I don't know what is up here.	CHITCHAT
If there's like a some fines or something, but there's like some red Flowers up here.	O
I think they're attached onto another balcony that I didn't include in my painting.	O
So I'm going to try something else.	O
Instead of doing the balcony, I'm going to put a little swirly swirly vines up here, 'cause I like the idea of there being red Flowers back there.	O
Thanks season.	CHITCHAT
K project Oh my God yes, project joined the coffee club.	CHITCHAT
Come join us.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be sipping sipping cappuccinos outside here.	CHITCHAT
Talking about painting.	CHITCHAT
You're like the fourth person or fifth person who said that, including I was also thinking the same thing.	CHITCHAT
We're on the same page.	CHITCHAT
We're ready for a trip.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's pop in some little red Flowers.	O
For those of you painting along, if there is anyone I know it's nice to know roughly when I'm going to be ending so that you can.	CHITCHAT
Share your art along at the end.	CHITCHAT
So I want to be able to give you an estimate, but I'm not sure I'm.	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking maybe 30 to 40 minutes if things go well for me to finish this up, but I'm not.	CHITCHAT
You know, sometimes I can be really wrong and estimates depending on if things go smoothly or not.	CHITCHAT
Love this kind of painting.	CHITCHAT

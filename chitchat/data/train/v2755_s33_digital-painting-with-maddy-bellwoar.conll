I mean making creatures or Dragons making something mystery.	CHITCHAT
Ah yes, like mystery fantasy type stuff.	CHITCHAT
I like that too.	CHITCHAT
I definitely like it as something to look at, like as a viewer.	CHITCHAT
I also like looking at that type of Art.	CHITCHAT
As a creator.	CHITCHAT
I like it also, but generally more humanoid characters like, not necessarily Dragons and stuff.	CHITCHAT
It's not that I don't like it, I just don't.	CHITCHAT
I tend towards human human characters.	CHITCHAT
My starting up another crystal study for Friday.	CHITCHAT
Nice, I thought about doing another one today and I was like.	CHITCHAT
I've done a few of them already, was like I kind of feel like doing something different.	CHITCHAT
So here we are.	CHITCHAT
Mix ended up a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Little details on the pipes.	O
There's also some wires running through here.	O
Well, the colour should be a little bit more like blue green color.	O
So these tiny little wires I love things like this because it seems like when you're painting them, it's like, seems silly to paint like little wires and stuff like, hey, that's not very aesthetic, but doesn't give an overall kind of cozy feeling to the scene when you include those details.	O
I think it's nice.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we can be a little choosy like I'm not going to paint in a little trash can.	CHITCHAT
But I like the wires.	CHITCHAT
The wires I'll do.	O
Better paper now learned from my last crystals.	CHITCHAT
I think doing one more in watercolor would be good kind of put into practice.	CHITCHAT
That's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
That's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
What paper did you get?	CHITCHAT
Are you saying cold pressed or hot pressed?	CHITCHAT
I'm curious, I can't remember if you.	CHITCHAT
If we discussed this already.	CHITCHAT
If you like the texture paper.	CHITCHAT
Haha why yourself ugly face once you have them and they work.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's definitely a little at first like.	CHITCHAT
Going to have a bunch of 'em in there.	CHITCHAT
I think that it starts to make more sense.	CHITCHAT
Also, that's of course of personal preference thing too.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not everybody agrees.	CHITCHAT
Cold pressed save hot pressed.	CHITCHAT
It freaks me out too smooth.	CHITCHAT
I like hot pressed but I'm kinda with you like I don't know I like.	CHITCHAT
Something in between, almost like for me.	CHITCHAT
It's perfect if it has a very very light texture.	CHITCHAT
I don't like deep deep grooves in the paper.	CHITCHAT
But a light texture is nice.	CHITCHAT
It's great when you find the perfect paper.	CHITCHAT
Steven, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks a lot.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have any questions, let me know.	CHITCHAT
Was using 25% cotton, which is fine for gouache but really stops me from doing washes in Gouache now.	CHITCHAT
Small sheets of 100% or did some bigger without but have to be next week.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that will be.	CHITCHAT
That will definitely help.	CHITCHAT
I notice the difference myself.	CHITCHAT
Two with those papers.	CHITCHAT
If you don't have a big enough proper paper in the cotton paper, sometimes yeah, if you're going to be painting really, really with a lot of water, it just.	CHITCHAT
It's so unpleasant.	CHITCHAT
Hot press is great for airbrushing that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
That makes sense.	CHITCHAT
I normally used Haha.	CHITCHAT
I normally use hot press paper despite my.	CHITCHAT
Complaints it's my usual go too, but sometimes I like the type of paper companies that make hot press that have the tiniest bit of like a smooth texture.	CHITCHAT
But you can just see the paper texture tiny tiny bit.	CHITCHAT
Versus like the Super super smooth one Jackson.	CHITCHAT
Yes I can see your message.	CHITCHAT
Almost since I started using Photoshop, it really has done wonders what type type of studies do you suggest I do since I just started using photo shop.	CHITCHAT

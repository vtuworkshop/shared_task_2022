Oh, I have suggestions.	CHITCHAT
Well, first of all, almost what kind of art do you want to be able to do?	CHITCHAT
Ideally like what do you want to?	CHITCHAT
Are you interested in portraits, landscapes, anything?	CHITCHAT
Just open minded.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if you have a particular thing in mind.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you, carry him if you.	CHITCHAT
If you guys are interested below my stream in the description, there's a link there.	CHITCHAT
It says resources and tutorials page and there's a link that has been a list that I've been compiling over the past years that I've been doing digital art.	CHITCHAT
Just things that have helped me out overtime so it's all like the most helpful tutorials that I found and lots of good stuff there, at least to my tastes.	CHITCHAT
All things that I found super helpful, so I hope you'll find something.	CHITCHAT
In there you know there's YouTube channels, there's stuff on Gumroad and Patrion and all different types of things.	CHITCHAT
One of the things that was really transformative in my art, like I don't know how else to explain it like something that really really changed everything for me was.	CHITCHAT
Doing shorter time studies and doing virtual plein air painting.	CHITCHAT
So I was interested in doing environments and just working overall on my understanding of color, an light, different, different lighting scenarios and things like that.	CHITCHAT
If you're really not interested in landscapes and you want to do portraits, for example, I think you can apply this kind of idea to anything.	CHITCHAT
But the idea is doing along with whatever other projects.	CHITCHAT
Let's say you have, you're also doing some personal work and that you.	CHITCHAT
Want to spend more time on and you know, get a nice Polish result to your painting.	CHITCHAT
That's totally fine too.	CHITCHAT
Obviously continue doing that, but along with those types of works, if you find sometimes sneak in some time to do studies for yourself that are shorter and anything between like for me, I would say 45 minutes to a couple hours and just focus on.	CHITCHAT
The very basics for each thing like the most important things you want to work on our composition.	CHITCHAT
And values like the lights and darks in the scene and colors but don't worry too much about detail.	CHITCHAT
Don't worry too much about textures and things like that, just focus on the basic things at the beginning and so you're going to learn.	CHITCHAT
The thing is when you're painting a landscape so much of the important part of the painting happens at the very beginning.	CHITCHAT
It happens in the first hour and 2 hours and then after that you're doing a lot of little.	CHITCHAT
Polishing your polishing, making things look nice.	CHITCHAT
And this not, but if you really want to get the most bang for your Buck out of the time that you're spending studying, do shorter studies where you just practice that initial stage of the painting process where you're most likely going to fall into errors and problems, and then do that and then move on to the next one.	CHITCHAT
So stop after the couple hours, try to get as much done as you can that time, and then start the next one and just do those as your studies is not to say you shouldn't spend more time on your work in other.	CHITCHAT
Situations, but this is a specific type of study that you want to do along with your other work.	CHITCHAT
All Mrs.	CHITCHAT
I fell in love with a sceneries.	CHITCHAT
After seeing your work and also staying in Germany.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of beautiful sceneries that I want to paint.	CHITCHAT
I do want to try doing semi realistic paintings of figures similar to yours so I can add them to the environments.	CHITCHAT
That's really cool to hear.	CHITCHAT
I feel like we have a lot of the same goals or you kind of have a similar experience to meet with some of your inspirations.	CHITCHAT
So let me give you a couple links in particular.	CHITCHAT
So there's a video.	CHITCHAT
By you guys, maybe no proco already.	CHITCHAT
He has a YouTube channel that's super super awesome for artists.	CHITCHAT
Lots of really good.	CHITCHAT
Really good information, but he has a video I'm going to share in the chat right now that I would suggest watching to anyone and it's about.	CHITCHAT
Doing these quick plein air or virtual Plein Air Studies that are shorter and the reason why to do them, he explains it better and in more detail than what I'm saying now.	CHITCHAT
So if you're a little confused about what I'm saying, watch this video.	CHITCHAT
It's like 8 minutes.	CHITCHAT
It's well done and it's going to explain how to make.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, maximize the efficiency of your practice sessions.	CHITCHAT
That's what he's talking about.	CHITCHAT
And So what I do is a lot of studies that are called Virtual Plein Air Studies.	CHITCHAT
I did not invent this.	CHITCHAT
OK, there's a lot of artists doing this, so the idea is you use a website, for example, map crunch.	CHITCHAT
Com is a really popular one.	CHITCHAT
To find images from anywhere in the world.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to post that link in the chat too.	CHITCHAT
So you can just press go and it's going to take you to a random place, so these images are mostly from the Google Street View car, so you're going to see a lot of the side of the road, but there's also you'll find really cute places like look.	CHITCHAT

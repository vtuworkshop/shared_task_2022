There's very paintable places that you find on here.	CHITCHAT
Just clicking go.	CHITCHAT
Going to all different kinds of moods, all different kinds of times of the year, times of day, such a variety and it's super super useful to find a composition that you like from here and paint that and do it in like the shorter amount of time and just work on doing these overtime.	CHITCHAT
You're going to get better at so many things are going to get better at lighting.	CHITCHAT
You're going to get better picking compositions from these.	CHITCHAT
You're going to get better at.	CHITCHAT
You're going to get faster, so it's like the most transformative thing that I started doing for my art.	CHITCHAT
Was this particular type of study.	CHITCHAT
Before doing this, I was.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, which is a lot slower and I had a lot less.	CHITCHAT
This was a way for me to get like a lot of knowledge and experience in a relatively short amount of time 'cause I was spending many, many many hours on each painting so it was kind of like taking me longer to gain the experience.	CHITCHAT
So this is a really helpful way of studying, especially if you're interested in doing environments.	CHITCHAT
Just doing quick studies from these.	CHITCHAT
If you look at my Instagram, which I'll post in the chat again in a moment, you can scroll through and see a lot of.	CHITCHAT
My.	CHITCHAT
Virtual Plein Air paintings.	CHITCHAT
From the past, I don't post all of them, but I posted a lot of them and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's just.	CHITCHAT
There's so many.	CHITCHAT
I've been doing.	CHITCHAT
These are probably done hundreds of them, and that might seem overwhelming.	CHITCHAT
But don't think about any number.	CHITCHAT
Just think about doing like.	CHITCHAT
Whenever whatever works for you, maybe you want to try to do 1 every other day, or like it depends on your individual.	CHITCHAT
If you're working.	CHITCHAT
If you're in school, how many?	CHITCHAT
What went your study regiment is going to be?	CHITCHAT
If you want to try to be on a schedule at all, but I think it's a really good goal to try to have some kind of schedule and just stick with it.	CHITCHAT
Overtime, it's going to turn into something that you have a bunch of knowledge that you didn't have before.	CHITCHAT
If you just stick with it.	CHITCHAT
I promise.	CHITCHAT
Um owner says, is it difficult for someone who works in graphic design and coding websites to learn digital painting?	CHITCHAT
I don't think that it's difficult for someone in graphic design or like that's not what would make it difficult.	CHITCHAT
It's not like that's working against you or anything linear.	CHITCHAT
It's just.	CHITCHAT
For any one, it's going to be work to learn this kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
For some people, some people maybe have a little bit more of a natural vision in some way or another, like some people tend to be better with Stylizing.	CHITCHAT
Some people tend to have.	CHITCHAT
Maybe they work well with colors, like sometimes people have little bit of a natural strength towards a certain area, but beyond that everyone has to go through the same pains.	CHITCHAT
Learning something new regardless of what you've done before if.	CHITCHAT
If you already use photo shop and you already have some knowledge of general.	CHITCHAT
Design rules for your graphic design that could help you, rather than someone who has no artistic knowledge and no knowledge of photo shop, you're in a better place in that person, for example.	CHITCHAT
Really, oh, that's so cool almost.	CHITCHAT
Yeah yeah, let me take a look.	CHITCHAT
That was very nice of him.	CHITCHAT
Oh these are awesome.	CHITCHAT
3D.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, a lot of these are places I would love to paint.	CHITCHAT
For example something like this.	CHITCHAT
This is absolutely a scene I would like to paint.	CHITCHAT
Like the beautiful lighting, warm and cool, the Blues and warm golds.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I might be falling behind a little bit in the in the chat.	CHITCHAT
You guys let me see.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I caught up.	CHITCHAT
If I missed any questions you guys can you guys can repost it.	CHITCHAT
If anything scrolled up if I didn't see any question you wanted answered, make sure you post it again and I'll.	CHITCHAT
I'll be sure to answer it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to do the finishing touches on this painting here.	O
There's still a couple of flower pots missing, so that's very important.	O
We can't be missing flower pots.	CHITCHAT
He's this photo shop in 3D Max.	O
A lot.	CHITCHAT
You have three having 3D in your toolkit is really awesome for digital painting.	O
Yeah, maybe you guys could do some collaborations in the future that be really fun like you can paint over 3D.	CHITCHAT
A lot of artists and concept artists use 3D's.	CHITCHAT
There you know there.	CHITCHAT
Underpainting not really underpainting, but they paint on top of it.	O
As a base to make the.	O
Seem more realistic and solid and everything.	O

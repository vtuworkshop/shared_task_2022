Proper perspective and everything working out.	O
All right, so we've got to put a couple pot planters here.	O
I want to.	CHITCHAT
Make them pretty.	CHITCHAT
Big compared to the ones in the back.	O
Remove this one over.	O
I'm keeping them on separate layers to start with because it's really nice to be able to move from around like this.	O
And sort sort that out without having them be merged, and then as soon as we decide where they're going to go.	O
Merged.	O
So this one will be a little bit of A.	O
Warmer color I think mostly because it's closer to the wall with all this bright bounce light.	O
Yes, that's right, that's right meunier.	O
You are correct about my color wheel.	O
If anybody is interested, I put the link to it in the description below the stream.	CHITCHAT
There's also a discount code.	CHITCHAT
The color wheel is an external plugin that has some extra options and things.	O
Not a.	O
Requirements but.	O
I like it.	O
Let's go a little bit a little bit brighter on this one.	O
Yeah, we're almost there.	CHITCHAT
Then we gotta put some plants.	O
I really like the contrast and type of leaves.	O
These have little bit more almost like tropical leaves.	O
So I think I might start with just the big.	O
Green blob.	O
And then we'll we'll add some more.	O
Leaves with specific shapes coming out, but I'm going to try to block in a big shape first before I get into individual leaves.	O
Oh, nice surface perfect.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we've got a bunch of green here to start with, but now I'm going to take the lasso tool an make these little shapes for these sharp.	O
Leaves coming out and I'm going to hold shift to keep adding more and more leaves because it's hard to make this whole shape at one time so.	O
Shift and just add more and more.	O
Yeah, I think so too.	CHITCHAT
I think so too.	CHITCHAT
Is not for free.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's not free the Coulouris.	O
If you have photo shop, if you have a CC 2019 or later like any more recent versions of photo shop, you can go to window color.	O
And then you you may be seeing the Hue Cube.	O
This is the default, but you can.	O
Go to the color wheel.	O
You can click this and go to color wheel and then you'll get this one.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
That one comes with photo shop, so you don't have to pay extra for it.	O
It has slightly less.	O
Some of it doesn't have all of the features of Coulouris, but honestly I don't even use most of these anyway.	O
I like colors because I like how the interface looks and I like how large it displays the foreground color.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Just arrived from living this painting place.	CHITCHAT
Reminds me of my hometown.	CHITCHAT
Hi Eric, thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I don't know where your hometown is, but this is in Spain, so maybe it's maybe it's close to where you from.	CHITCHAT
But it seems like you're from a beautiful place.	CHITCHAT
Almost as a way to contact you if we have questions.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so there's so I will put an invite.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you use discord, but I have a discord community.	CHITCHAT
That you might enjoy it to be apart of.	CHITCHAT
You can share paintings and work in progress and questions with me and a bunch of other artists that are in there and you can send me a private message as well as just joining the actual server and participating in there.	CHITCHAT
There's lots of tutorials shared and things like that.	CHITCHAT
Aside from that you can always send me a message here on be hands.	CHITCHAT

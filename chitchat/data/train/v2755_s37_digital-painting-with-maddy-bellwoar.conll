When I'm not streaming and you have a urgent question photo shop or at question.	CHITCHAT
That's that's fine.	CHITCHAT
You can message me here.	CHITCHAT
I also stream on Twitch, I do digital painting on Twitch on Tuesdays and Fridays, so if you.	CHITCHAT
I have something to ask me.	CHITCHAT
I might also be live at that time just on another another platform so.	CHITCHAT
You can ask me there too if I'm if I'm live.	CHITCHAT
You're from Brazil own ice.	CHITCHAT
Pink colours plugin has much more features.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I mean pay that's why they are charging for their thing, right?	CHITCHAT
You know they design then have been up keeping this so it's not free.	CHITCHAT
I do think they have a trial and there's a discount code, but Tulip coolers is, uh, something have to purchase.	CHITCHAT
and I do think it's worth the money.	CHITCHAT
Personally has been for me, I've been using.	CHITCHAT
I paid for it once I've been using it for years, so I've been happy with it, but there may be other similar types of color wheel plugins that are free.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if they would have like all the same.	CHITCHAT
You know things that color is has, but.	CHITCHAT
Can we look around?	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of different ones out there now.	CHITCHAT
I've heard people talk about a chameleon and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's you definitely get your moneys worth, especially if you're using it for a long time like what I have ended up doing.	CHITCHAT
I think I bought my cooler is back in like.	CHITCHAT
2014 or something like that, like I've been using it this whole time so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, definitely was worth it.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I almost forgot that I was working on this plant.	CHITCHAT
I got totally.	CHITCHAT
Extracted OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's see, I'm going to lock the transparency.	O
So that means this shape that I created.	O
I'm going to press this little checkerboard icon up here and then I'll be able to paint easily within this shape so I can quickly give a little bit of shading or highlight everyone.	O
I think of it.	CHITCHAT
I'm a little bit of color to these individual leaves.	O
So this is like layer one.	O
I want to do one more layer of leaves would be a little more natural I think, and some of the leaves have for yellow on them.	O
So little little plants next to it.	O
Also make a bunch of selections here.	O
Just holding shift.	O
OK.	O
So let's do layer 2.	O
So now we can get some more of these, add some foreshortening, some leaves that are kind of angled towards us.	O
See how this looks.	CHITCHAT
So I've got selection.	O
Pick a nice green, yeah, not bad.	O
If you want for the ones that are kind of coming out from the plants you can give it a little shadow.	O
Towards the center where it's going deeper.	O
Yeah, we can add that little bit of yellow stripe to some of the leaves.	O
That's fun, isn't it?	CHITCHAT
It's a bit intense, but I think I like it.	O
So we can do the same to the little one, or we can have them be two different types, and maybe this one doesn't have the yellow.	O
I think I like the yellow though.	O
Let's let's do it.	CHITCHAT
All right?	CHITCHAT
So I think I like this overall, although the this spot I feel like I should make it a little bit darker.	O

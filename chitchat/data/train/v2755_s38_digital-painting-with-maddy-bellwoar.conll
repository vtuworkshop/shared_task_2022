Yeah, that was a little bit more in the Shadow and we're having kind of the same issue with the pots as with the chairs earlier they need a little bit of shading underneath of them for it to feel a bit more convincing.	O
I think that they're really sitting on the ground, so.	O
Will put some little shadows and maybe blend them in after, so I'm just going to pop them in here first.	O
And then.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we can do a little blending 'cause it seems kind of.	O
Stark.	O
Little shadow behind them on the wall.	O
Yeah, that's true for a lot of things.	CHITCHAT
We're including Workflow.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you make decisions about how you work based on what's comfortable to you sometimes.	CHITCHAT
People will suggest so you can do it better this way or easier this way and.	CHITCHAT
It's always good to consider those things.	CHITCHAT
So it's good to be willing to try something new, but if you're if you're really more comfortable doing it the old way and you're able to still get a good results and everything, sometimes you do things the in a longer way, for example, because you like to do it that way, and that's OK too.	CHITCHAT
You have to be comfortable in your process.	CHITCHAT
You have to be having fun.	CHITCHAT
I think that's also important.	CHITCHAT
Results are important, but enjoying your work is important too, especially in the long run.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put a little bit of warmer light on the tree.	O
The tree is getting hit with really really bright light and in my version I didn't quite go.	O
That far with it, but I think it looks nice.	O
And it it makes sense based on the chairs and everything else the light shining on, it makes sense.	O
This tree.	O
It's getting.	O
Some little splashes.	O
This is fantastic that I caught the live feed high Adam, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Having so much fun with your Ghibli brushes, their amazing thanks.	CHITCHAT
So you're very welcome.	CHITCHAT
And thank you for purchasing them.	CHITCHAT
I'm really, really glad to hear you like them and you're having fun with them.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining the stream too.	CHITCHAT
I can show you and anyone else who is kind of getting here.	CHITCHAT
Now I'll give you a quick recap of the painting process.	CHITCHAT
We can go back in time I tried to save and you knew layers every so often.	CHITCHAT
So I tried to build this up a little bit more like a traditional painting because I wanted to get that kind of look at the end result that it was more of a pain through painterly feeling.	CHITCHAT
So I'm pretty happy with it.	CHITCHAT
Overall, my complaint at this moment.	CHITCHAT
Is.	CHITCHAT
Everything seems very like over on the left and I think maybe I could try zooming in a little bit.	O
Do you guys see what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Like I feel as if it's just.	O
Everything is too.	CHITCHAT
There's too much blank space.	O
So maybe zooming in a little bit feels better.	O
And also maybe I can do something more with the shadows on the ground over here to help direct RI back in towards the right, like have the shadows kind of pointing back in on the grounds.	O
Maybe I could add some little random leaves on the ground or something.	O
There's some dead leaves, you know, just it's a bit stark.	O
I think the pavement, the patio pavement.	O
Maybe I could add more texture to it.	O
The the pavement has a lot more little grooves and things in it than what I currently have, so those are some ideas.	O
Let's try first with the shadow.	O
So there's a shadow coming in.	O
I'm going to do a little smudge.	O
On it.	O
Maybe lower the opacity.	O
It was easier for me to paint it in pretty dark so I could see clearly, but I don't think it needs to be so dark.	O
Let's flip.	O
Good call.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Ryan.	CHITCHAT
Little shadow there and we kind of do the opposite, so that's overlay mode so I can also add highlights with it, and I think making that little splash of light back here at tiny bit more dramatic might also be fun.	O

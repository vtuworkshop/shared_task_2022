Hey clever.	CHITCHAT
Been lurking in and out.	CHITCHAT
It's been interesting to see this like you captured in the layers.	CHITCHAT
Real pretty outcome too.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I hope I can maybe upload that little step by step thing.	CHITCHAT
At the end.	CHITCHAT
I don't always remember to take little steps.	CHITCHAT
Little.	CHITCHAT
It always remember to keep those aside.	CHITCHAT
But I was able to remember today.	CHITCHAT
But thanks, I'm glad you find it interesting and that you like the results.	CHITCHAT
So far.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to pull it together here with like the last little things to make it feel complete.	CHITCHAT
I hope your day is going well.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm like second guessing five zoomed in too much.	O
I think it's fine, it's probably fine.	CHITCHAT
Let's put a little bit more light here.	O
I was trying to do that with overlay.	O
It didn't really work.	O
Let's try linear Dodge.	O
I put my.	O
Brush and my.	O
Layer blending mode on linear Dodge.	O
Do you choose not to include the sign on the wall because it would look better without it?	CHITCHAT
How do you decide what to include or not?	CHITCHAT
That's a good question.	CHITCHAT
Uh, so for me.	CHITCHAT
There's a few things that can help me decide.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes they just go with like, my personal preferences are instincts like.	CHITCHAT
If I think something, it might be really distracting to have in the scene, or just didn't look great in the reference.	CHITCHAT
Or I don't mind this sign.	CHITCHAT
I just.	CHITCHAT
It didn't seem super important to me, and it seemed kind of it wasn't like really, really pretty.	CHITCHAT
It's not like ugly either.	CHITCHAT
It's blue.	CHITCHAT
It's not really bad color, but sometimes when I'm painting scenes I leave out some of the man made elements that are not so aesthetic like signs or a little garbage bins or something like that.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I'll add them and sometimes not.	CHITCHAT
So a little bit of romanticizing the scene, I guess, but now that you mention it and I'm looking over there, this the sign might be a really nice way to bring in a little bit of the blue over to the left because it seems very very like.	CHITCHAT
Blue, blue and then pink side side.	CHITCHAT
So maybe the maybe the sign would be nice to add.	CHITCHAT
I didn't add the bicycle because I felt like it was getting a little bit too busy with the bicycle overlapping the chairs and I've got the chairs just worked well enough as a focus point so.	CHITCHAT
I didn't include the bicycle on purpose.	CHITCHAT
I think the sign I might try adding in you can tell me what you think.	CHITCHAT
If you think it looks good.	CHITCHAT
Hey, Machiavelli, welcome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I just go with instinct and trial and error.	CHITCHAT
Luckily because this is photo shop and not a traditional painting, I can easily just try something and see if it looks good and if I don't like it then we just gone.	CHITCHAT
Out with the layer.	CHITCHAT
Wow, that's intense.	CHITCHAT
Let's try a little darker color.	O
Hi Tyson Alright, well my sign is not necessarily the same proportions.	CHITCHAT
As the one in the reference.	CHITCHAT
But I can just scribble in something that looks like text here.	CHITCHAT
What do you guys think?	CHITCHAT
Do you think it's too intense?	CHITCHAT
The color might be.	CHITCHAT
Let me lower the saturation a little bit.	O
I don't know if it's just doing too much, but I think I like it.	CHITCHAT
Uh, I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try making a layer on color Dodge and adding a little bit of highlights on to it.	O
So that it kind of matches the area around it.	O
Maybe that's it's looking out of place because it doesn't have any highlights.	O

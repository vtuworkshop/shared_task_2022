Thank you Tyson, that's very nice of you.	CHITCHAT
It looks realistic.	CHITCHAT
You like the sign?	CHITCHAT
OK Harry, I'm really glad you asked about the sign.	CHITCHAT
We gave it another chance because of your question.	CHITCHAT
I think it helps bring the blue into this side of the canvas 'cause it was a bit we were missing that there's two things I did that started eliminating blue from this side of the scene.	O
One is the.	CHITCHAT
One is the I didn't put in the little garbage cans.	O
There's like little garbage cans.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can add just one of them.	O
Well, I think that's what they are down here.	CHITCHAT
The got little garbage cans.	CHITCHAT
They have a little plastic.	CHITCHAT
On them like a white plastic, but look at how blue.	O
The shadow is.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Look at that blue and then look at the blue reflection on these.	O
I didn't get these plants in yet, so.	O
All of that missing blue.	O
That's definitely yeah.	CHITCHAT
If we add that in, it helps to tie it in.	O
OK.	O
So maybe I can use the eraser to give these little.	O
Kind of crazy details the trash can has all these little swirly mesh details.	O
Like the addition of the blue and pink, but it might be a bit vibrant.	O
Yeah, it's a bit intense.	O
I think it's partially because my pink was like so so bright here.	O
Maybe if I.	CHITCHAT
Turn it down a little bit.	O
Jackson says looks amazing.	CHITCHAT
Maddie here's my take.	CHITCHAT
Well, thank you first of all, and let me check it out.	CHITCHAT
I went with a bicycle.	CHITCHAT
It looks so good.	CHITCHAT
This is a really strong one, Jackson.	CHITCHAT
What a cool choice.	CHITCHAT
You get one of the chairs in the table, but focusing on the bike and what are beautifully painted bike, I can't believe you did this in such a short time I really love it.	CHITCHAT
Love the color dynamics.	CHITCHAT
Brushes beautiful feeling of light shining through.	CHITCHAT
Is awesome.	CHITCHAT
Really really nice work.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for painting with us.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it definitely feels complete.	CHITCHAT
Alright, let's add little bag on top of here.	O
So there's two little garbage cans.	O
I'm just going to add 1, but I'm trying to figure out where to put it.	O
I think that's fine.	CHITCHAT
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
There.	CHITCHAT
So that brings in a little bit of blue, and then we'll have some little flower pots on the table.	O
I think I might select.	CHITCHAT
I might just use the lasso tool to select the shape of little pots.	O
That's going to be easy way to get a nice sharp shape.	O
So I got 1 two.	CHITCHAT
Paint those in.	CHITCHAT
And they are metallic, which means they reflect a lot of light from around here and every other color that's around it so.	O
Can color pic from the wall.	O
Like mostly Gray.	O
But with a nice blue.	O
Reflected light.	O
And these are kind of recognisable little pots they have.	O

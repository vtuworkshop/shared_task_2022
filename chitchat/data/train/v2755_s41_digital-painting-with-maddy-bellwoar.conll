This common pattern of a little little rings around.	O
I think a lot of us have seen these types of little flower containers.	CHITCHAT
So something like that.	CHITCHAT
Not too crazy and then we can put a little planes coming out.	CHITCHAT
These little details I think you know they take time, but it really helps the scene feel alive and.	O
Cheerful little flower pots on the table is a.	CHITCHAT
Worth the effort.	CHITCHAT
Hi Richard.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Still going to paint in some.	O
Green leaves.	O
I'm going to go.	O
To a lighter, warmer color, green working their way up.	O
Love painting plants and.	CHITCHAT
I really like the effect of.	CHITCHAT
You see, with like the warmer green at the top and then in the shadowed areas, there's always going to be some cooler greens and little blue reflected lights and things like that.	O
I also have a.	CHITCHAT
I have some brushes that have little leaf effects so could also use those.	O
But sometimes for a little situation like this, it's nice to do some of it hand painted.	CHITCHAT
Unique, unique look.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Mina Horse.	CHITCHAT
I'm ready to put in some bright pink Flowers on the table here.	O
So I'll grab the back to my basic brush and we want a nice.	O
Maybe we can sort of tie in this.	O
Yeah, this bright pink.	O
Oh, that makes me really happy.	CHITCHAT
So cheerful.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add more Flowers than what it actually has in the picture.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Thanks a lot of the challenging reference, but I enjoy painting along.	CHITCHAT
Love how you turned out.	CHITCHAT
Now I can look at it much more calmly and appreciate even wear your brushwork.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Know you're not a rushing along next to us.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
1 area I didn't get to do yet which needs some.	CHITCHAT
Love is over here on these these windows.	CHITCHAT
I gotta paint the bars in here so I'll do that on the separate layer.	O
Alright, I'm not going to go for the an identical look to the reference, I'm just going to try to make something that looks nice.	O
I'm going to put some different thicknesses to the window bars.	O
Hi Jay, as I call you, how are you?	CHITCHAT
Even that might be too not enough space in between them.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
My Windows didn't really come out the right proportions.	O
Let's make these little smaller.	O
Oh, welcome back.	CHITCHAT
More near sorry about the tech difficulties for you.	CHITCHAT
Some holding shift to make these lines perfectly straight.	O
It happens to be.	CHITCHAT
It's really handy that.	CHITCHAT
The angle of my.	CHITCHAT
Photo and everything.	CHITCHAT
It works out that I can just hold shift sometimes.	CHITCHAT
It's not so easy to use that.	O
And it works out perfectly here.	O
I might have to alter this color.	O
It might be a little too dark for this area that I'm painting it right now, but I'm just going to worry about shape first.	O
Just put in detail and then we'll go back and.	O

Worry about the color.	O
Missed last 10 minutes.	CHITCHAT
Well, we did some details on the Flowers and stuff, but you came back at a good time.	CHITCHAT
Danner Pride Hi Welcome.	CHITCHAT
How have you been?	CHITCHAT
Trying to consider the perspective and like roughly what kind of angle I should have for these windows.	O
These little details.	CHITCHAT
There's also some little swirls and things I'm just going to be really casual about scribbling them in.	O
I don't think we need to be super precise for us to get the feeling of what kind of designs this would be, you know.	O
Just some simple little swirls.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Thanks red.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, thank you Dana.	CHITCHAT
My reference images in the description below the stream if you or anyone's curious, check it out.	CHITCHAT
It's a really pretty scene, so I've enjoyed painting a lot.	CHITCHAT
The only part I didn't really enjoy that much was painting the chairs.	CHITCHAT
The chairs felt a little tedious, but.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise.	CHITCHAT
This has been one of my favorite ones to do here, I think.	CHITCHAT
All right, before we merge this, I want to take the opportunity to paint any extra things below that.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to be merging the other things we did.	O
But below the.	O
Bars that a time where I can say OK.	O
There's a.	CHITCHAT
There's an extra little.	O
Detail here, they didn't paint in before.	O
Little bright highlight.	O
So once we merge these down, it's going to be harder for me to pay anything behind there.	O
So I'm going to lock the transparency.	O
And grab a lighter color.	O
Color of the.	O
Light hitting these bars whoops.	O
And just paint that on top.	O
I've gotta find the right colour though.	O
It's going to be really bright.	O
That might work.	CHITCHAT
It's not fun, so it's not going to be everywhere, it's the dappled.	O
Lighting is also hitting these, so if you want to add some, leave some areas darker than that works.	O
Do the whole thing Bray, this all pretty bright.	CHITCHAT
And then over here it's more of a dappled situation.	O
The green probably should be later.	O
Over on this one, there's just so much bounce like going on even.	O
Even in the shadows it should probably be a little later than what I had.	O
Alright, that's better.	CHITCHAT
The chairs, that's why only painted one ha so smart.	O
That's what I should have done.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so lightning up some of that a little bit.	O
Selecting the wrong brush.	O
Oh, good luck red.	CHITCHAT
Have fun.	CHITCHAT
I hope it goes well.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I'm going to merge those down now.	O
What can we do to finish this up?	CHITCHAT
I think the floor we can add some more.	O

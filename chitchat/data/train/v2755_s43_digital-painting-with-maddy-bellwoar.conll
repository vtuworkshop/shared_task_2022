Brush work down here.	O
So there's not much interesting going on.	CHITCHAT
In this on the floor, so there's there's some little dried leaves and stuff, but I'm hoping that maybe I can make some interesting paint strokes.	O
This is supposed to look like more like a traditional painting.	O
So I'm hoping I can when I'm painting in some shadows and things here on the ground that can maybe make some interesting marks that might help it somehow.	O
I have some canvas textured brushes but I don't know if that's a good direction at this stage in the painting 'cause there's.	O
Not a lot of it elsewhere.	O
Do you think it might be one of those situations where I need to come back and take a fresh look at this?	CHITCHAT
After a little bit of a break for me, the painting is just about finished.	CHITCHAT
I wanted this to be a study.	CHITCHAT
This isn't the Super super polished piece and I'm pretty happy with the lighting and everything.	O
So what I might do is, after last little little touches I might end it here and then.	CHITCHAT
After a little bit of a break, come back and look and see if maybe I get some different ideas with the floor and I can do something just a little spiff it up a little bit, but at the moment.	CHITCHAT
I don't not really getting too much.	CHITCHAT
Love the Dappled Light.	CHITCHAT
The scene is so great.	CHITCHAT
Odd, dappled light.	CHITCHAT
Thank you James.	CHITCHAT
Maybe maybe I could add some more light onto the floor.	O
Maybe that would be interesting.	CHITCHAT
So floors just got nothing going on right now.	O
I probably should have thought of that issue earlier, but for some reason in the reference image it doesn't bother me.	O
But maybe I can add some little.	O
Flashes of light on the ground.	O
Somewhere.	CHITCHAT
Like leading in towards the.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it feels believable.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, Harry, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I think I will leave it as it is for now and then.	CHITCHAT
I might I might go back and add some dappled light or something.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to take a fresh look at it.	CHITCHAT
Susan says.	CHITCHAT
Looks finished to me.	CHITCHAT
I think it could be finished.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if I'm overthinking it or not.	CHITCHAT
But Yeah, I think I think I might end this one here for now.	CHITCHAT
So from the beginning we could skip through this real quick.	CHITCHAT
It was a different kind of process for me.	CHITCHAT
Usually I sketch before getting into the painting.	CHITCHAT
It worked out pretty well considering I didn't do a sketch beforehand, like we didn't end up with anything super super out of place.	CHITCHAT
Sign it package called done.	CHITCHAT
Cool alright yeah I will.	CHITCHAT
When I when I when I look at this one and decide it's finished I think I'll post this one here on be hands think I like it enough that I'll post it sometimes they don't post all the studies that we do.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Dana Project, a tiny one.	CHITCHAT
Very small.	CHITCHAT
Thank you JS, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Machiavelli.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll post this on my probably my Instagram and my account here so you can see the finished one.	CHITCHAT
Go get that cup of coffee that sounds good.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
This was a really fun stream.	CHITCHAT
I enjoyed the painting a lot.	CHITCHAT
I think this is one of my favorite ones to do here so.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for all the nice comments and company.	CHITCHAT
I really appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
I stream here every Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
This stream is actually like a little bit on the shorter side.	CHITCHAT
I might stream a little bit longer next time I like to do generally like to do a couple paintings, sometimes one, sometimes 2, sometimes 3.	CHITCHAT
I did enjoy the workflow, it was very.	CHITCHAT
It was fun.	CHITCHAT
It was fun to work like this without the sketch.	CHITCHAT

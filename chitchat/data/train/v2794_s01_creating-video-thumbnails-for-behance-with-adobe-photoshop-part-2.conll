There goes the green again.	O
We're gonna roll with it.	CHITCHAT
What if I make it pink?	O
Little red Oh yeah, yeah yeah, let's go with the red.	O
OK cool I'm gonna roll with that if you guys got some suggestions please let me know.	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at what we got going on did never mind that middle right there.	CHITCHAT
This is Delta TM and today we're going to be doing some thumbnails if you have not noticed, let me show you.	O
Let me show you my Behance.	CHITCHAT
And what I want you to see is how.	CHITCHAT
I'm going around adjusting these thumbnails.	O
That you see on behaves the awesome folks at Adobe.	CHITCHAT
The Behance team is making it possible for last year's like myself too.	CHITCHAT
Now adjust these thumbnails and they call them.	O
What do they call it here covers right the video covers and So what I want to do is organize them so that they don't look very.	O
They don't look as random as they look right now, so that's the double checking what it looks like right now oof the lighting.	O
Is insane, there's a lot of light.	CHITCHAT
Who is turn that one off?	CHITCHAT
As a matter of fact, we going to turn that one off over there.	O
There we go, this, uh?	CHITCHAT
This is crazy, so any case?	CHITCHAT
So I don't want it to look as random as it is I want to kind of make sure that there's a consistency.	O
There is some order to this stuff, so let me check that we have good good.	CHITCHAT
Are you over here and?	CHITCHAT
Make sure you can hear some of the music in the background.	CHITCHAT
We got chill hot.	CHITCHAT
So what am I going to do then?	CHITCHAT
What am I going to do yet?	CHITCHAT
So the light that's too bright?	CHITCHAT
That's what it is and it doesn't help this webcam.	CHITCHAT
So what are we going to do?	CHITCHAT
We're going to work on Adobe photo shop.	O
Let's pull it up here we go.	CHITCHAT
Boom photo shop.	CHITCHAT
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
Photoshop was happening with you and this are the files that I've already started working on.	O
So let me go ahead and open one up, the latest one, and one of the three things.	O
There's three things that you should concern yourself when creating thumbnails for these videos on YouTube.	O
Be hands.	CHITCHAT
Wherever you're allowed to have a thumbnail number one, this should have a face.	O
Now no one said it should be.	O
Your face is preferably that is your face, but at the same time it could also be a drawing.	O
It could be a caricature yourself, and it could be someone else that is involved in your projects.	O
Let's say you know I used to have a camp, and, uh, let's say I uhm made my cat domain.	CHITCHAT
Hum person main thing in the photo of my cat or characters from my cat, but that becomes the thing that's the focus of these thumbnails.	CHITCHAT
We need to focus and there has to be a person or thing.	O
And so in my case I'm going with an illustration of myself.	O
Second thing that you should have is a reference point.	O
Weather is this a series or what is the brand name for this series of videos?	O
So in this one is called vector my astral DTM because I'm working in vectors right so?	CHITCHAT
Illustrations when Adobe fresco part one the ends up in illustrator.	CHITCHAT
So this.	CHITCHAT
This was a project that I started in fresco an flipped it into illustrator.	O
An boom published in a mobile game.	CHITCHAT
And so that means I am doing my vector, my extra work, and so that's where that title is going to be.	O
An all of those situations where there's a vector illustration when it's a photo shop, like today, then the focus is the photo shop logo, but also something photo shop.	O
So I had to think about that.	CHITCHAT
Graphic design, so visual design.	CHITCHAT
That's what we're going to call it.	CHITCHAT
So there's going to be a main name for the serious.	CHITCHAT
I was family.	CHITCHAT
Been a minute.	CHITCHAT
Yes Dwayne, thank you for being here.	CHITCHAT
It's been a very busy February.	CHITCHAT
Good thing that we have some time in March and the little moment to get back in to be hand.	CHITCHAT
So here I am.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for joining this and then the third thing is going to be the title and so the title should be clear.	O
The title should reference what it is that you're here to learn what's going on in this video, and that's why my text is kind of big like that.	O
So mobile game illustrations with Adobe fresco part one.	CHITCHAT
Now let's look at my videos.	CHITCHAT

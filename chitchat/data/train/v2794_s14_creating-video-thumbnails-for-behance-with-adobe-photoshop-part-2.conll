Thank you for Duane for leaving me a comment.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the rest of you who are now watching and saw some of this process.	CHITCHAT
Let me just review with you what happened here and a couple of things to keep in mind when you are creating your thumbnails right.	O
These are the rules.	O
A number one have a face in the picture.	O
Uh, that's my signature right there.	O
Boom, that's number one #2 is described.	CHITCHAT
What people are here to see, right?	CHITCHAT
#3?	CHITCHAT
If this is like part of a series or something, just put it on the put a title or something on the thumbnail, so that then it becomes like inconsistent thing across all the different videos and #4 is.	O
A clean background, something that's interesting and in my case, the software that I used in these videos, right?	O
So I made it clear that this is a fresco to illustrator thumbnail, so it has that green to orange transition and then it all works really well together.	O
And if you check out some of.	CHITCHAT
The creative cloud.	CHITCHAT
Let's go here.	CHITCHAT
Discover.	CHITCHAT
Um, live maybe I can go to the lives who's live online?	CHITCHAT
I know, I'm lying anyways.	CHITCHAT
Adobe life schedule.	CHITCHAT
Look at, look at the thumbnails that Adobe produces, right?	CHITCHAT
So it's like very similar.	CHITCHAT
So cloudy Virgin.	CHITCHAT
Her face is in there is faces the same.	CHITCHAT
There is a mass going on.	CHITCHAT
There's a background color.	CHITCHAT
There's some shapes in that background and then her name.	CHITCHAT
And then What is this about daily creative challenge?	CHITCHAT
Brushes right?	CHITCHAT
Just sit character styles.	CHITCHAT
And then we create a challenge.	CHITCHAT
So some of us who live stream we get a regular thumbnail slapped on the.	CHITCHAT
On the cover.	CHITCHAT
Because we live stream and then then the thumbnail is automatically generated.	CHITCHAT
However, now we're having the option of updating and there's one of my update it once right here, greet him, we don't thumbnails for YouTube and be hands with Adobe photo shop that was last night.	CHITCHAT
And uh, and of course like Terry White and part Ronnie look at that.	CHITCHAT
That is some amazing.	CHITCHAT
There's some photo shop illustrator cassisa illustrator guy, but that's the photo shop thing.	CHITCHAT
So that photo shop.	CHITCHAT
He's a photo shop master also and but he does it for photography.	CHITCHAT
So there it is.	CHITCHAT
It does it for everything is very good so they get the special treatment on their thumbnails which is pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
But you see the deal is that is very consistent, very repeatable.	CHITCHAT
It has a face.	CHITCHAT
It has the title.	CHITCHAT
What you're going to learn.	CHITCHAT
And it has a description of what you're going to learn in a title that is consistent across the series of videos, so that you know, OK, this follows next.	CHITCHAT
This follows next in this follows next, so check it out.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why this is on.	CHITCHAT
Let's see illustration photography interests me.	CHITCHAT
See that comes up in illustration, huh?	CHITCHAT
But they got those guys.	CHITCHAT

Hi folks.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, scary times, huh?	CHITCHAT
Those of you who are.	CHITCHAT
Worried about this virus and all that stuff?	CHITCHAT
At least we can hang out and.	CHITCHAT
Do a little drawing right, that's something.	CHITCHAT
I know, at least if I'm not out in the crowds just sitting here drawing on my iPad.	CHITCHAT
Probably safe, right?	CHITCHAT
I guess.	CHITCHAT
Uh, here I'm just warming up just doing a little sort of ahead study here.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, just.	CHITCHAT
Making it up as I go.	CHITCHAT
Probably because I'm teaching portraiture again this semester at the school of the arts here in Winston Salem, where I live Ohmygosh Andy Horner.	CHITCHAT
AH	CHITCHAT
Folks, anti Horner's in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Andy is what a brain wouldn't mind and imagination.	CHITCHAT
Creator of light children.	CHITCHAT
My favorite stories of all time.	CHITCHAT
We work together on trying to bring it to life as a graphic novel.	CHITCHAT
Years ago And still hopefully one day that will be a thing because it's just such a great story.	CHITCHAT
Not just saying that 'cause I worked on it, I mean really, it is just an original masterpiece so.	CHITCHAT
Hey Jeremy, thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Andy wow, I'm really.	CHITCHAT

Happened, don't know how.	CHITCHAT
But it will happen.	CHITCHAT
Hey Alberto, thanks yeah.	CHITCHAT
Well don't thank me for doing this.	CHITCHAT
This is what I like to do I get to draw.	CHITCHAT
It could be nothing better than that.	CHITCHAT

Nice to see you.	CHITCHAT
Andy, that's very kind here, sweetie.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Someday when I need to collaborate again and get our ducks in a row.	CHITCHAT
And then we both have busy lives, but hey.	CHITCHAT
Uhm yeah, what am I doing here?	CHITCHAT
You know this is just me trying to think about.	CHITCHAT
What I know about human heads.	CHITCHAT
Which is, you know, something I learn more about every year.	CHITCHAT
As I continued to, I mean I think all of us.	CHITCHAT
You know, we always want to get better.	CHITCHAT
We always want to get to that next level.	CHITCHAT
And for me.	CHITCHAT
Uh, you know, human anatomy is just one of those things.	CHITCHAT
I'll never get tired of.	CHITCHAT
Trying to get more proficient at.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just just making all these rhythms work, you know?	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I know that there are just some people who they just know it's so well.	CHITCHAT
And you know, I want to be one of those people, and I feel like I know it better than some.	CHITCHAT

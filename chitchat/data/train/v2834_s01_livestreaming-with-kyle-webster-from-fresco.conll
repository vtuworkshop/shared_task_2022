Certainly not as well as others.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, what else is there to say?	CHITCHAT
Keep improving, keep trying to get better.	CHITCHAT
I'm currently using the pencil in fresco.	CHITCHAT
I've actually, uhm, no, I'm not doing the 36 days of type yet Alberto, but maybe I'll mess around with that.	CHITCHAT
My buddy Paul also in Adobe Evangelist is messing around with that doing great stuff.	CHITCHAT
So go check him out.	CHITCHAT
I was going to say is this pencil I've got here this default pencil in Frisco is cranked.	O
I've got the flow cranked all the way up to 100 here.	O
So what that's basically giving me is this ability to.	O
Make some really, really dark lines.	O
If I wish with the pen pressure so it's kind of like drawing with like 8B pencil, you know high vice.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
And I love that because it's fun is if I want to draw really faint.	O
You know, marks.	O
Like if I were using like a 4H or something like that.	O
all I have to do is just drop the flow.	O
So you basically get the full range of pencils here in a single tool, which is really fun.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but so while we're here and while I'm just messing around and I'll get to the water colors in a minute, I was planning on just doing some sort of free form kind of watercolor E sketchy stuff here.	O
And then I started drawing this head and I got will distract it.	O
But while we're here I want to take the opportunity to use this chat that we have here.	CHITCHAT
For if anyone has any questions about pretty much anything having to do with.	CHITCHAT
Illustration the business of illustration.	CHITCHAT
Brushes, techniques, tools, you know.	CHITCHAT
Ask me questions so I can give you answers.	CHITCHAT
If I can, I think that would be a nice thing to do, and I do want to use the chat for that as much as we can in the same way that I do when I go on the live streams out Adobe.	CHITCHAT
It's nice to be able to field questions if anyone has them.	CHITCHAT
In real time you know, and it's also easier for me because while I do get a lot of emails and things, those are just harder to get too because of the way business works and so and he says, I remember your one line silhouette figured out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thanks Andy.	CHITCHAT
I love doing those drawings and like everything else, those disappeared simply because I got busy and just couldn't really keep up the schedule of drawing when every day even though they only took about 5 or 10 minutes.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
What artists are movements inspire me Oh my gosh, holy cow.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, well, we could be here for like 6 hours but.	CHITCHAT
I'm really into, you know, at the end of the day what I always come back to.	CHITCHAT
His people who draw so uhm, I love looking at paintings and I love looking at well all kinds of art, right?	CHITCHAT
But at the end of the day, what really draws me in is always the people who draw and didn't mean that to be a a pun there.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, that's what just gets me going.	CHITCHAT
That's what gets me excited is looking at draftsmanship and so examples of people, maybe who are dead?	CHITCHAT
Who did that would be day?	CHITCHAT
God a God is probably my favorite.	CHITCHAT
Draftsman of all time draft person.	CHITCHAT
He's really something else.	CHITCHAT
Uhm, you know, Sergeant really insane drawings?	CHITCHAT
I know he's so well known for his paintings, but I actually recently got a book of his drawings.	CHITCHAT
His portraiture that he did for his wealthy patrons.	CHITCHAT
And he says, what's the best reference in resource for 13 year olds to learn to draw anatomy?	CHITCHAT
Wow, that's a good question.	CHITCHAT
Um, so I like Michael Hampton's book.	CHITCHAT
Michael Hampton spelled that out here, HAMP 10.	CHITCHAT
His figure drawing book, which I believe is called figure drawing, design and invention.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
That's a really great book.	CHITCHAT
It gives you a little bit of Anatomy, gives you a lot of anatomy.	CHITCHAT
But just like what artists need to know, it doesn't go so deep as to go crazy with stuff that frankly.	CHITCHAT
Is just getting more until like medical science and stuff that frankly you can't see I think that for artists it's interesting to look at anatomy and.	CHITCHAT
Understand the surface and understand what's just beneath the surface, but really you don't have to go too much further than that to do some good stuff right?	CHITCHAT
So I would say check out that Michael Hampton book figure drawing design an invention.	CHITCHAT

You know there are some classics that people always bring up.	CHITCHAT
The end Andrew Loomis, you know book figure drawing for all its worth, is fun to look at.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure how instructional it really is really how it works in that way.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of a tough one.	CHITCHAT
I love looking at it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how much you learn from it.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, you learn from everything, but there are some that I think really break things down in a way that you can.	CHITCHAT
You can really understand.	CHITCHAT
Things in a new way.	CHITCHAT
You can see things in a new way and I like that about the Michael Hampton Book.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Albert's got a recommendation there.	CHITCHAT
Alphonse Muca.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so anyway yeah and back to the question of what inspires me.	CHITCHAT
I mean also.	CHITCHAT
I mean I just been reading comics my whole life so.	CHITCHAT
Love to look at comics if the drawings are good or if the drawings are different or interesting.	CHITCHAT
I haven't paid too much attention to the the you know DC universe stuff.	CHITCHAT
Too much of the Marvel stuff just because I find that like, even though a lot of the draftsmanship is just insanely good.	CHITCHAT
I think if it feels like the studios there or the design director is in the.	CHITCHAT
Whoever makes the decisions, they kind of want to stick to a certain formula for the way that work is drawn.	CHITCHAT
And it doesn't interest me as much as, say, those independently produced books.	CHITCHAT
Where at artists really gets total control over over everything like you see a lot of those coming out of out of Europe.	CHITCHAT
You know, in France and Spain, Belgium, Italy, places like that and there's just a really like the artist voice really gets to shine.	CHITCHAT
Yes, why I love Mike Mineola, Hellboy for example, or the work of Jillian Tamaki people who, when they do their comics work, there's just such a distinct look to it.	CHITCHAT
You know, that's their work.	CHITCHAT
I have yet to read all the umbrella Academy stuff Alberto.	CHITCHAT
But I heard it's very good actually got to have pancakes once with Gerard Way.	CHITCHAT
That was nice.	CHITCHAT
He came to Durham for the comic convention there and get some beat him and he was extremely sweet fellow as I'm sure many of you have heard.	CHITCHAT
If you if you heard otherwise, don't believe it.	CHITCHAT
He's he's a sweetie.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well listen I I could just keep drawing this face for a long time and mess around with it.	CHITCHAT
Um, but why don't we move on to something else?	CHITCHAT
Or, you know, tell me in the jet no dummy, you should keep doing this, but I feel like I'm just kind of going in circles.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
You know this is I'm just going to keep playing with this an probably not make it better.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably just keep going over the same areas and stuff, but that was a fun warm up.	CHITCHAT
Probably most often might go to is that just draw head right, right?	CHITCHAT
So let's skip out of this and here's a new feature we have in Frisco, which might not seem that exciting, but it's any new feature for me, I think is.	CHITCHAT
Is worth mentioning for those who don't know, tapping my layer and just clear the contents just like that, and you're done.	CHITCHAT
Question could always just make a new layer as well, so hide that, but make a new layer setting is to multiply because I have a background color in a really faint texture that I added this sort of paper texture here.	O
That was easy to do.	CHITCHAT
All I did was important image you see right here you can go to your photos.	O
I just grabbed a paper texture that I had picked up years ago.	O
I don't remember where just threw that in the back there.	O
I like using the water colors with a paper texture and for those who are curious and have asked about it before.	O
Not to worry.	CHITCHAT
We are of course working on improving and adding to the watercolor features here.	O
In Frisco and paper textures and options for that.	O
Or something that we've had so many requests for.	CHITCHAT
So I promise you, we are working on all that.	CHITCHAT
But here let me just grab one of the watercolors an put something down.	O
And this is fun for me is to just.	CHITCHAT
Make a shape.	O
Uh, an I love watching that paint moving so satisfying.	CHITCHAT
Hey, I just look at it and say OK, now what?	CHITCHAT
So I can do that so I can send you this.	CHITCHAT
And then say, OK, well now what can I do with that?	CHITCHAT

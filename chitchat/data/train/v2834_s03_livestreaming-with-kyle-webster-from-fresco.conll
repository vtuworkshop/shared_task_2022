So one thing I can do I think you know this looks like to Maine feels like a pair of like poofy, pants, legs or something.	O
So why don't we just turned it into something?	CHITCHAT
Isn't that fun to watch that paint move?	CHITCHAT
I mean, sometimes you have to paint anything specific at all.	O
You can just throw the color down and blend all day.	O
Alright, but why don't we want?	CHITCHAT
We actually turn this into something, so I think I'll use a orange.	O
Or no, you know what I feel like doing here, like he's a little green.	O
Greenish blue like this.	O
And then do.	O
A little shape right there.	O
And yeah, let that pick up a little bit of the colour that's down below.	O
Very nice aloe are the flow.	O
And then add a bit of color out here on the left and see what that gives me.	O
Is that ability to do?	CHITCHAT
That kind of edge that loste edge that softap edge out there on the left.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
OK, I think we now have something we can work with.	CHITCHAT
We added some erasers by the way.	O
Here show you those, so we've got a brush tilt eraser.	O
We have a gritty circle, a gritty square.	O
We got the hard round harder on variable.	O
Rectangular racer, a rubber eraser, soft, round and even a sponge.	O
I'll show you what the sponge looks like.	O
You can erase like this isn't that fun.	O
So yeah, check that up.	CHITCHAT
That's in the latest update.	O
All right, uhm, let's take this shape that we've done here, and let's turn it into a figure.	O
I might want to carve out a little something on the right side.	O
And I'll do that without.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's just do it with an array Sir, why not?	CHITCHAT
How about we use the gritty square like that one, so I'll just come in here and just get rid of that like that.	O
Perfecto.	CHITCHAT
And then how bad I use that same watercolor brush and just touch the edge, see that.	O
And let some of that paint just move off to the right already.	O
And now I'm going to go into my inking brushes.	O
I like to bounce back and forth between the water colors and the Photoshop brushes.	O
They're all interchangeable.	O
So fun.	CHITCHAT
What do we have here?	CHITCHAT
We gotta sumi brush.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Let's see what I can do that Sue me.	O
Make this little darker here.	O
Borrowing from that same color, and maybe I'll borrow from here and get a little darker.	O
And let's see how that Sumi is performing today.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty nice.	CHITCHAT
Like that?	CHITCHAT
Alrighty.	CHITCHAT
Let's take this and jazz.	CHITCHAT
Just do that.	O
Set alarm there.	O
And we'll just break into here.	O
And add a face and ahead there.	O
And we'll get this other arm.	O
Just come out this way.	O
Alrighty.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to take the whole thing and shrink it down a little bit so we got room to.	O
To work here.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
And while I'm doing this, let me know if you have any questions about these tools and so on.	CHITCHAT
Another thing I can do is use my lasso tool here and just come in.	O
And do a little.	O
Sculpty sculpty	O
Work right there and erase what's there.	O
That's nice.	CHITCHAT
Fingers a little nicer.	O
I mean, it depends on what you want to do.	O
You don't have to be like all precise with a drawing like this, but.	O
Sometimes I just feel like I want to.	O
Get some of those shapes to read a little more clearly.	O
Remember, I could always take my watercolor and I can take the color out of the brush like this.	O
Just tap this little transparent circle to the bottom right of the color wheel.	O

Just tap on that.	O
Now I have no color.	O
I can use a tiny bit of water, not much.	O
Low flow.	O
And I can actually come in and just.	O
Make some of this.	O
Part of the arm there.	O
Add some water to it.	O
To make that wet, you just can't do this anywhere else.	O
Folks like that fun, that is.	CHITCHAT
Make that all just.	O
Blend together that's so fun.	O
Lovely.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Amber is the color was using them ago.	O
I love using the color history.	O
I know exactly where I was.	O
Just grab that other color an pop some color in there.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I might wanna carry this down.	O
And I feel like I just want to add a really dark hit.	O
To this area right here.	O
So I'm just going to scrub some color in there like that.	O
I like how the color moves outward in an irregular.	O
Kind of pattern.	O
We spent months working on this stuff, you know.	CHITCHAT
OK, now what do I do next?	CHITCHAT
What do I do?	CHITCHAT
What do I do I do?	CHITCHAT
Let's take this and let's add a little something up top.	O
So why don't we take that same color that I've got here and just like that a little bit?	O
I like that.	CHITCHAT
That's really pretty.	CHITCHAT
Get my brush a little bigger and just come right up.	O
From here.	O
And just make this shape.	O
Home.	O
Simple as that, right?	CHITCHAT
Already Hey Manual, not using Frisco.	CHITCHAT
Andy asked, was I involved in the development of this tool?	CHITCHAT
Adobe Oh yes indeed very heavily.	CHITCHAT
I made all the default brushes here.	CHITCHAT
All these categories you got about 100 of those up.	CHITCHAT
I was a consultant on all the live brushes.	CHITCHAT
The watercolors and oils.	CHITCHAT
And I worked really closely with the design team to help with the interface and things like that.	CHITCHAT
I had a great time is about a solid two year project for me.	CHITCHAT
So lots and lots of work and I was so excited to do it so.	CHITCHAT
And happy with the result.	CHITCHAT
But never satisfied with.	CHITCHAT
Resting, we have a billion things I want to see us do to make it even better.	CHITCHAT
So that's what we're doing now.	CHITCHAT
We have a release coming out, usually about every six weeks.	CHITCHAT
Pretty aggressive release schedule for fresco so.	CHITCHAT
I'm just doing some refinement here, connecting things coming up this way.	O
Going down this way.	O
See how I just keep bouncing around between different brushes?	O
I'm using the water colors and I'm back to the photo shops and so on and so on.	O
Someone asked what are my favorite brushes.	CHITCHAT
I don't have favorite brushes, that's why I keep making so many because I just keep getting bored and I want to make you stuff just how I am.	CHITCHAT
Um, carrying on with that sumi brush from earlier, I can go back to that color I had.	O
I think I want it.	CHITCHAT
Think I want to put.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Suggestion of.	CHITCHAT
Legs down here.	O
And one out here.	O
There we go.	O
I like that.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to take this, make it a little smaller and pop it over here on the left.	O
'cause maybe will make another one after this, right?	CHITCHAT
Just do another quick one.	CHITCHAT
So what do I wanna do with that hat or whatever that is?	CHITCHAT
I would like to add a little something to that as well and pick up that same color I was using earlier.	O
And not going to use too much water.	O
Drop that down to about 40 and not too much paint either.	O
So that's going to be about 50.	O
And I just want to add a second shape like that.	O
And just blend at all in.	O
I have no idea what's going on up top.	CHITCHAT
It's some kind of weird hat, you know, whatever.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
And then I could take this foot and just pull little shadow out like that.	O

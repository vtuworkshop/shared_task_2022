Shadow can be any color.	O
Who cares, right?	CHITCHAT
He really just taking it and.	O
Making a shape on the canvas.	O
I can use this software brush for that as well just come across.	O
Soften that edge.	O
Add some of that dark color back in there.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Let's see, this looks cool.	CHITCHAT
Are you still doing Photoshop brushes?	CHITCHAT
Yes, of course.	CHITCHAT
Emanuelito Photoshop brushes every quarter.	CHITCHAT
So the spring brushes just came out.	CHITCHAT
I did a preview of those right here in a live stream little while ago and they look like this and set the ones no sorry, I've got way too many brushes.	CHITCHAT
Here they are.	CHITCHAT
So uhm, yeah, lots of really good brushes.	CHITCHAT
There's the bash brush.	CHITCHAT
The bouquet brush.	CHITCHAT
This is named after George Brock Brock brush.	CHITCHAT
Right do this on other layers so you can see them.	CHITCHAT
The Chap Tinker is really lovely inking tool.	CHITCHAT
Zoom in on that so you can see what that's doing.	O
Um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, go check these out there free if you gotta CC subscription creative cloud subscription.	O
Go to photo shop, go to get more brushes and then you can download these and just play with them.	O
I don't retire brushes.	CHITCHAT
Andy know they'll just, they'll just sit there, there open that library forever, basically.	CHITCHAT
So by the way, the mushy brush from that set mushy is a brush that I use all the time for.	CHITCHAT
Just lose figure drawing as well.	CHITCHAT
It's really fun to.	CHITCHAT
To use for that purpose, just block in a little.	CHITCHAT
Will figure.	CHITCHAT
This is a Photoshop brush that you can grab from that same set.	O
And check it out.	CHITCHAT
Since the mushy brush.	CHITCHAT
Lots and lots of fun.	CHITCHAT
And you can see I think why it's called the Brushy Brush 'cause it's pretty mushy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
There's another quick figure you could play with.	O
Have him sitting on this stool.	O
There.	O
Actually posted a figure drawing that I did with the mushy brush awhile back.	O
On my Instagram, I believe so.	CHITCHAT
Play with that and here's what I like.	CHITCHAT
I could do something like that and then I can take the watercolor brush and if I want I can just like Passover bits and pieces of this.	O
So what we did is we made sure that in Frisco you can.	O
Use the watercolor brushes to wet anything that's on the canvas like not just the watercolors that use.	O
So if I use a photo shop branch like this and I just want to pull this all together.	O
Into a nice.	O
Watercolor, then I can just do that and that's what I'm doing right now.	O
So that's a pretty wonderful feature.	O
And then when you get is the best of both worlds.	O
So I get some of that texture and that look from.	O
What was built into that Photoshop brush?	CHITCHAT
Then I also get to take advantage of the watercolors in Frisco and pull all that together.	O
So that's pretty fun.	CHITCHAT
And also then.	CHITCHAT
Do a little shadowy.	O
Shape under here you know.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
Carry that up.	O
There's a nice little silhouette.	O
And you could also do some subtractive stuff right?	CHITCHAT
Thanks Andy.	CHITCHAT
I say yeah, you could also do some subtractive stuff so I could take.	O
One of my Photoshop brushes like the free flow free flow, Russia skews me.	O
That's what that's in the spring update.	O
And what I've shown people before.	CHITCHAT
Really fun.	CHITCHAT
Any brush can be an eraser instantly.	O
We have this touch modifier.	O
This little circle I can drag it around here.	O
I could take that and I can simply tap on it with my thumb and now I'm using this brush to erase.	O

OK.	CHITCHAT
So what that means is I could do things like just.	O
Tap and.	O
Give this fellow like I sort of shape for the hair.	O
That Right tap.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Outline some kind of AI.	O
Garment.	O
Right?	CHITCHAT
I'm erasing right now.	O
I'm not painting, I'm just taking pigment away from what was already there.	O
That's all I'm doing.	O
Getting some white tennis shoes.	O
Siri that is.	CHITCHAT
Gosh, that's not a great outfits like he's wearing AT shirt and tennis shoes and nothing else.	O
But hey, if that's what he wants to rock, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to judge the guy.	CHITCHAT
But maybe to make everybody more comfortable in the.	CHITCHAT
Stream here, I'll just go ahead and.	CHITCHAT
Make that until I got more of a tennis outfit, OK?	CHITCHAT
There we go OK.	CHITCHAT
Wow, so much better.	CHITCHAT
See you later Alberto, thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so look, anything could be an eraser.	O
Just go ahead and use that touch modifier if you want to stay in your race mode for a long time and don't feel like holding your thumb there.	O
Just double tap on it.	O
And now I'm just erasing data.	O
There take the stress off your thumb, right?	O
I know my perspective is so wonky here, like that's tools in a completely different perspective from the rest of this fellow, but.	O
What are you gonna do is just a quick sketch, right?	CHITCHAT
OK, there's a couple of figures.	O
Easy enough, right?	CHITCHAT
Can group those together.	O
Group, you just want to tap and drag a layer on top another layer in your grouping.	O
Hide those making new one.	O
Set my blend mode to multiply.	O
Very nice.	CHITCHAT
And let's just do one more.	O
So watercolor wash soft I've got to wash flat brush.	O
Uh, let's do the wash flat and let's pick a different color here.	O
Lots to choose from.	O
And by the way, you can make these brushes so big, like 500 pixels and look, there's just no lag.	O
And so is it be, I love that.	CHITCHAT
Alright, I use a bit more water here.	O
We use 7070% water here or something around something around there.	O
That's fine.	O
Pretty decent amount of paint on my brush.	O
And let's just do a shape and react to that shape so.	O
Here we go boom boom boom.	CHITCHAT
And there and just a little color.	O
Variation.	O
And see where we go.	CHITCHAT
All right, there is my shape.	O
So now what?	CHITCHAT
And the ideas?	CHITCHAT
Anybody see anything that I'm going to try to create figures from these shapes?	O
That's the goal.	O
Break it, always do that.	O
See if that changes what I see.	O
Oh, I got something.	CHITCHAT
Alright there we go.	CHITCHAT
There we go I got it.	CHITCHAT
That there.	CHITCHAT
Joey, what's a modern figure drawing class look like?	CHITCHAT
Is it still newsprint and charcoal?	CHITCHAT
You know, it depends on who's teaching it with the way I teach.	CHITCHAT
Figure drawing is newsprint and charcoal, so that's what I do.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
Everybody has different ways of doing these things.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure there are people out there who are using iPads now.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, don't know I.	CHITCHAT
I tend to think though, that the way to do it is is just to be using the.	CHITCHAT
Um?	CHITCHAT
The best thing to do is to still just use.	CHITCHAT
The news print the charcoal because you don't get distracted by any of the bells and whistles that come with digital, right?	CHITCHAT
You're just having to really understand with one simple tool.	CHITCHAT
How to render form?	CHITCHAT
How to control your line?	CHITCHAT

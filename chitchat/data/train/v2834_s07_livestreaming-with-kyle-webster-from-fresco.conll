How to do all those good things right?	CHITCHAT
So that's what I that's what I think.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure people out there might disagree, but that's cool.	CHITCHAT
If you do, let me know, I want to hear your.	CHITCHAT
I want to hear a defense for.	CHITCHAT
Using digital in figure drawing environment if you're teaching.	CHITCHAT
Curious to know what you think about that.	CHITCHAT
I see I used to Photoshop brush.	O
Right to get some of that stuff in there.	O
And now I'm just.	O
Changing some of the edges.	O
With the watercolor brush, it's just so fun.	O
Right, so here's what I was seeing.	CHITCHAT
Watch this, grab my Photoshop brush again and I think I'll switch it up to maybe I could use one of the spring brushes as well.	O
So let's go to that spring set.	O
Spring 2020.	O
And Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Well, I like that free flow rush.	O
I was just using.	O
What else do we have here?	CHITCHAT
Lots of fun stuff.	CHITCHAT
I like this Willow.	O
Kind of charcoal brush.	O
This is a nice one.	CHITCHAT
Here's what I'll do.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a selection right here.	O
Anne, just going to paint inside that?	O
There we go.	O
And then I'm going to.	O
Make another selection.	O
Right here.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do this.	O
You'll see what's going on here in a moment.	CHITCHAT
Same deal paint inside there.	O
Don't worry that guys thumb is short for a reason, I promise.	O
It's because he's going to be holding.	O
His phone.	O
And I want to be listening to some music so.	CHITCHAT
Are we seeing like a big poofy sweatshirt?	CHITCHAT
Kind of a thing here.	CHITCHAT
That's what I was seeing.	CHITCHAT
So sorry to disappoint anybody who saw something else, but that's just what I saw.	CHITCHAT
And I want to add his phone and we use a pop of color for that.	O
I really like using these pinks right now just into that.	O
So let's go ahead and do that.	O
Just.	CHITCHAT
Little shape right there.	O
And let's.	CHITCHAT
Hold on a second, I'll zoom in more so I can see what I'm doing.	O
Add a little bit of color here and here.	O
OK.	O
And you know what?	CHITCHAT
I'd love to do.	CHITCHAT
Give him some pink sunglasses because.	O
That's just a fun way to take that color that we have down there and carry it up into another part of the illustration, right?	O
You all know the rules.	CHITCHAT
Basic design.	CHITCHAT
Principle of.	CHITCHAT
Taking your colors and bouncing around.	CHITCHAT
Inside your illustration, so that there is a some harmony in there, right?	CHITCHAT
Now here.	O
I'm actually just going to darken.	O
That area because what I want to do is get that head to pop forward a little bit just like that.	O
Perfect OK.	O
I like that I like that feeling good.	CHITCHAT
Um, back to let's do the Inky shredder brush.	O
This is a fun one for line work.	O
So I can just.	CHITCHAT
Do that.	CHITCHAT
Just to add a little bit of separation.	O
Between some of these areas like that maybe even do like a little kind of.	O
Idea that there's some.	O
Textural stuff, some wrinkles and folds really.	O
I'm just adding some visual interest there, you know.	O
Separation of the hood.	O
For example.	CHITCHAT
See what that does?	CHITCHAT
That's a fun way to work.	CHITCHAT
Get some flat color down and then do some drawing on top of that flat color, OK?	O
And now I want to do those headphones.	O

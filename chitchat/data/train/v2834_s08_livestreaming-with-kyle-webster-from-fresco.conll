And I'm just going to use this really nice.	O
Cleaning King brush.	O
We have as a default for sketching in Frisco.	O
This pen is just really, really simple, easy to use.	O
And I use some white.	O
And just draw it out.	O
Andy, thanks.	CHITCHAT
And here we go boom boom boom let's do a little Loopy Loop.	CHITCHAT
Like that?	CHITCHAT
And up inside.	O
And then I'll split it here.	O
And let it come up the other side.	O
And now we know he's listening to some music.	CHITCHAT
And that's pretty much it.	CHITCHAT
What else is there to do I mean, I could use that same Willow brush from before and do something.	O
I could use the affects brushes.	O
Maybe add a little spatter?	O
Because it's better.	CHITCHAT
It's just one of those things right where.	O
It just makes everything better.	O
Look at that.	CHITCHAT
Is that same blue?	O
There.	O
OK, we're done.	O
That's it, uhm?	CHITCHAT
All right, before I run.	CHITCHAT
Is anybody have any questions about anything having to do with the app having to do with brushes having to do with art in general drawing?	CHITCHAT
Whatever you want.	CHITCHAT
Boy, that's a long thumb.	O
Why don't we just erase a little bit of that holy cow?	O
Nobody told me anything about that from there.	CHITCHAT
You know, I mean, I know this guy is not like anatomically perfect or anything, but certain things you should probably edit.	O
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
Thanks Joey.	CHITCHAT
Well, hey, thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for watching this and I'll do more of these in the future.	CHITCHAT
Of course, hope you learn something, or if nothing else, hope you had just a good time watching.	CHITCHAT
OK so thanks Diego, really appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, sometimes it takes a little moment to get warmed up, but then ideas started to happen.	CHITCHAT
So this is what we got going here for this guy.	CHITCHAT
And we also earlier if you missed it.	CHITCHAT
We're done these two figures.	CHITCHAT
And before that flips my Apple pencil's tip is coming up there.	CHITCHAT
We go and then after or before that we had done this little head drawing just as warm up.	CHITCHAT
If you want to see more of that kind of stuff in the future, please do let me know.	CHITCHAT
OK, make sure you hit me up on Twitter.	CHITCHAT
Twitter is where I spend most of my time.	CHITCHAT
Listening to what people have to say, answering questions, etc.	CHITCHAT
OK, not so good on Instagram, but I'll get better at it.	CHITCHAT
But I don't really read the message.	CHITCHAT
Is there anyway we had the head?	CHITCHAT
We got these couple of figures here.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
We also finished off with this fellow, so I'll pop them up on Twitter.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for watching again and take it easy everybody.	CHITCHAT

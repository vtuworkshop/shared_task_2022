Just like this and again.	O
I decided to bring size resize it back to our original size.	O
And Wala this is a regional images resized Oh look at this same quality also guys.	O
A smart object very helpful example.	O
If you will convert your layer to smart object in you will decide to apply a Camera filter.	O
You will launcher Camera filter and you will switch to profile example.	O
You will convert your black and white OK and now you need to send it to your our client and your client will open photo shop and without.	O
Having multiple layers your client can simply hide Camera filter just like this.	O
Just hide it and bring it back.	O

It's not too small to make a small print anyway.	O
But yeah, it's a good size.	O
I think so.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm glad you came over Reaper.	CHITCHAT
Are you staying close to the ref or stylizing a bit more well.	CHITCHAT
I think I always stylize some amount whether I want to or not just because I'm not painting.	CHITCHAT
I'm never painting in like a hyper realistic manner.	CHITCHAT
So there's always going to be a little bit of stylization to it.	CHITCHAT
I generally lean a bit more towards like semi realism like kind of idealizing some of the features and the smoothing things out of it, I guess.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Lately, I've been really favoring a more traditional painting style to the artworks through the paintings.	CHITCHAT
If that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
So I like to use textured brushes.	CHITCHAT
I like to use things that resemble oil painting or gouache painting or watercolor.	CHITCHAT
I like I like going for a traditional kind of look in my digital painting, but I'm very much doing like style explorations lately so.	CHITCHAT
We'll see how it goes you might see some I might I'm going to be using my painterly brush set so if you guys want to download that it is, you can find it.	O
Again, on the screen in the stream description or in the info panel.	CHITCHAT
This is a free brush set and I've made some of the brushes and some were collected overtime.	O
You can download it.	O
Like I said it's free to download and there's a lot of.	O
Textures like this, let me show real quick.	O
Some of the brushes that I like have this kind of texture to them.	O
So it's a little bit to imitate traditional type of painting look and also for anybody who has the Adobe If you have the subscription to photo shop.	O
If you have Adobe.	O
CC then you can download the Kyle Webster brushes as well.	O
And those have a lot of good traditional textures, and a lot of awesome awesome effects.	O
Traditional type affect so those are good to look at 2.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's my plan that's my plan today will see what we end up with.	CHITCHAT
But Yes, it will most certainly certainly be a little bit stylized so I'm going to start out with a Gray background just because I think it's a little bit more relaxing to look at and easier to start with so we'll start with a Gray background and I'm going to use my pencil brush and Oh actually yes and I also have the reference image over here, we bring it on screen.	O
From my other monitor do why is it stuck.	CHITCHAT
There we go just so you can see what I'm looking at you can download image if you'd like to see a closer.	CHITCHAT
Pilot tiesha welcome how's your day going?	CHITCHAT
I hope you guys are doing good.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to paint the whole image for this one like it's I'm considering this a portrait.	O
But it's also you know, kind of upper body.	O
We're going to get the whole.	CHITCHAT
We're going to get the whole thing in because I need to practice painting fabric folds, and wrinkles and things.	O
I really like this sweater.	CHITCHAT
It's so cozy looking and soft.	CHITCHAT
So we'll try to like really make it look like that.	CHITCHAT
So when I'm painting someone even with like a big fluffy sweater like this, I like to consider there.	O
Their skeletal structure underneath the clothes so I'll kind of do like a little stick person.	O
Because that helps me figure out where to place things if you kind of start painting the outside without thinking about what's going on underneath of it, you're going to end up with a big blob.	O
It's nice to at least think a little bit about where things are going underneath of the underneath of the clothes.	CHITCHAT
Um red it's just allergies.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for being concerned, but I've been getting this question a lot.	CHITCHAT
Lately, an sadly.	CHITCHAT
This is just kind of what I'm going to sound like for the next maybe 2 months.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully not that long, but I have seasonal allergies.	CHITCHAT
I always get really bad allergies in the spring, usually even if I'm taking Medison I end up being stuffy and.	CHITCHAT
Itchy eyes and weird voice and all kinds of stuff.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, don't worry.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sick.	CHITCHAT
I'm just yeah.	CHITCHAT
This is how I am at this time of year spring seems to be starting early here in the Netherlands.	CHITCHAT
We didn't get a proper winter and yeah, there's all kinds of Flowers blooming and it looks nice.	CHITCHAT
But then it makes me like this so.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry I have some tea, I will be drinking, so that helps a little bit.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah got a little bit of a sketch like a stick person sketch and then I'll lower the Opacity on that and make a new layer and just start painting on Top or sorry sketching on Top next layer of.	O
Next layer of.	O

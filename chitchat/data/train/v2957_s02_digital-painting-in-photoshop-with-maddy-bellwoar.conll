Detail.	O
Oh, that's OK read no, I know I don't mind that's OK.	CHITCHAT
I just feel bad 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I've been getting that question a lot feel like I'm concerning you guys over over nothing but this is just like how I am right now.	CHITCHAT
Reaper says my problem with that is every time I try it.	O
They always end up looking through the but I think it's a practice thing I just need to get better at so I like using the stick person to just imagine that it's like this skeleton underneath and then I lower the Opacity and make a new layer and start properly sketching in in a more you know, keeping an eye moron like a 3D kind of.	O
Viewpoint of it.	O
So right now, I'm sketching in the wrinkles.	O
And going around here.	O
And so you can still see where the stick person is inside the sketch, but at least that gives me like an idea of where to put everything and then I don't end up really, really far off you can still be a little bit off.	O
But it helps it helps give some kind of a starting point, I feel like.	O
It can be overwhelming when you're starting to work on something.	O
Do you still have the same food allergies actually it's been a little bit different since moving to the Netherlands Interesting?	CHITCHAT
I guess the produce is a little bit different here.	CHITCHAT
I have, I do have some still have some food allergies, but?	CHITCHAT
It depends it's a little bit less like I can eat some things I couldn't eat before.	CHITCHAT
At least certain brands of things I don't know if that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
But like I'm allergic to some apples, but not all apples.	CHITCHAT
Not all brands of apples.	CHITCHAT
It might have something to do with chemicals being used rather than the actual Apple itself.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I do?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
But back to the painting.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's bring this arm down here.	O
I will give a little wrinkle over on the side.	O
And we can flip the canvas to get a look at it from over here.	O
I want to get the feeling of her like kind of leaning over a little bit so I think it's working OK, so far.	O
Let me change my.	O
Eraser.	O
I like the post of her hand.	O
I think it's pretty.	CHITCHAT
I like wearing sweaters that have a little bit longer sleeves because it's extra cozy and warm and.	O
Yeah, I can keep your hands warm.	CHITCHAT
I often have cold hands.	CHITCHAT
So I like sweaters like this, I like cats coming up a little higher on her hand.	CHITCHAT
OK Letisha well, thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy the lurk.	CHITCHAT
So let's get the head sheep.	CHITCHAT
Hi Mister, Photoshop are how are you?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add a little bit more tilt to her head.	O
I think I under estimated it.	O
So yeah, will tilt it a little bit more.	O
And that way we can have her hair kind of gravity is sort of affecting.	O
Her hair and it's coming down around an over the shoulder like this.	O
OK so I want to sketch in her facial features.	O
And probably I probably will do this on another layer so I feel OK with how this looks so far, so I'm going to make a new layer that way.	O
I have more flexibility to move things around.	O

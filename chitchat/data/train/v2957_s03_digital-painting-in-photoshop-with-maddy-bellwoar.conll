I think I made her face a little bit, too big but let's see how it goes.	O
Reaper.	CHITCHAT
Your being torn in different directions.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's make some lines here to try to help guide us on where facial features will go so this will be roughly like the eyes and eyebrows and then the nose and mouth is close to her, her hand is very next to her mouth so that will be down there and then her chin gets covered up by the hand.	O
And her finger should be a little bit more up here in the cheek.	O
So we'll move that and then her other finger.	O
Down there.	O
Sketch in the eyebrows.	O
I like to make these guidelines and then lower the Opacity.	O
And draw on Top of it, so that I can use them to help me figure out where to put things but they don't block my vision, so much.	O
I'm a real.	CHITCHAT
Who are you little question?	CHITCHAT
Are you working with the graphic tablet if yes?	CHITCHAT
Which one I'm doing good thanks and I am using a tablet.	CHITCHAT
I have a welcome centriq 22 and that is a.	CHITCHAT
Screen tablet, but I'm using a stylus to draw on the screen.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of options out there, though this you don't have to dive in and get something like a centigrade off the back 'cause they're.	CHITCHAT
The generally a little bit more on the high end tablet wise, but I do really love my tablet, but there's a lot of options, you can look into.	CHITCHAT
There's tablets that.	CHITCHAT
You know there's screen tablets and then there's tablets that have it's kind of like your drawing on the mouse pad looking up at your monitor those are generally.	CHITCHAT
Less expensive models, but can still be really good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Oh, I forgot to mention that Mills.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's really, really great news.	CHITCHAT
Behance just made some some.	CHITCHAT
Upgrades basically behind the scenes.	CHITCHAT
So there will be less delay in the conversation between the chat and and you know what I mean, there's a little less stream delay, so it's going to be easier for us to chat.	CHITCHAT
It's yeah, it's a big improvement high share a little question are you working with the graphics tablet.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, yeah, so I'm using a Wakeham Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
I can post the name in the chat.	CHITCHAT
In case it's easier to read that then my pronunciation, but yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm drawing on the screen.	CHITCHAT
I think it's really helpful for painting it's not required to have a tablet for all types of.	CHITCHAT
Digital art of course, but if you are painting or drawing and you want to have pressure sensitivity like for example, if you want.	CHITCHAT
If you want your brush to get bigger and darker as you press down that's something that you can't really do with the mouse.	CHITCHAT
You need a tablet some kind.	CHITCHAT
Red cells would you say chatting me or chat and I OK this is one of those things to get off topic from art and go into a grammar.	CHITCHAT
Discussion that's one of those things when I was in school.	CHITCHAT
Apparently saying like chat and I or you know, my friend Susie and I would be technically correct grammar from what I was taught but nobody speaks like that at least not.	CHITCHAT
Where I'm from in America?	CHITCHAT
Most people will say and me, just colloquially more normal to say so.	CHITCHAT
You can certainly say, and I if you want, but Nobody really speaks like that commonly so it's kind of strange but.	CHITCHAT
Hey Drado welcome thanks for joining us.	CHITCHAT
OK so let's sketch in her mouth.	CHITCHAT
Depends on where in the sentence, it is.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's also true that's also true.	CHITCHAT
I have definitely don't know the rules enough to start teaching grammar two guys.	CHITCHAT
I just know that normally it's one of those things that it's not a big problem.	CHITCHAT
If you say, and me 'cause you'll just sound like most other people?	CHITCHAT

Hey al, How are you?	CHITCHAT
So I feel like it would be a benefit me to just take a little bit of extra time to sketch in the face and things and we can always fix it a little bit more in the painting phase.	O
It's going OK, Reaper I'm I'm taking classes and that's going well, learning a language is a long journey just like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, learning an instrument or learning painting, it's something that you have to work on over a longer period of time I don't necessarily feel or see like a drastic improvement from one day to the next but I know I'm doing the right thing.	CHITCHAT
Just studying and keeping going with it.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, it's going OK.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Sammy how are you?	CHITCHAT
Thanks for the next comment.	CHITCHAT
Hi Hun, Ji how are you?	CHITCHAT
So the models like looking at us.	O
So I can put her.	O
Iris and the Right corner of her eye.	O
She is a really pretty.	CHITCHAT
I shape I think in her eyebrows like it.	O
I think I've given her much bigger forehead, then she actually has Bo.	O
Luckily, that's easy to fix one thing I love about digital art is you can just in this case.	O
I'm using the lasso tool.	O
You just make a selection of an area, I can transform it down.	O
I can work it, I can there's just so many ways.	CHITCHAT
You can take your pick.	CHITCHAT
But there's a lot of different ways to easily modify that so I use the transform tool is quite a bit in my sketch phase to fix little things here and there.	O
Hi Phil's how are you?	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's merge these 2 layers together had them separate for awhile.	O
But I think we're good to merge and see what we can do from here.	O
So she has a little bit of a swirl going on in that her hair and the hair part.	O
And then got cheekbone and her finger kind of.	O
Pushing into her cheek a little bit so we get a little bit of an indentation there.	O
And then this finger.	O
And then this one.	CHITCHAT
And then finally little one.	O
We do see her knuckles coming out.	O
And then the sweater.	O
Alright so let me just take a look at the fabric folds because I do want them to be accurate.	O
Since this is one of the main reasons that I'm studying this image is because I want to get some practice painting folds fabric folds.	O
It's something that I generally kind of avoid be honest.	CHITCHAT
And my way of avoiding it is just I'll generally really tone down any folds that exist in fabric when I'm painting someone I find that they can make an image look really messy and they make it hard for you to see the anatomy of the person.	O
I tend to like to paint more fitted clothing.	O
But even when there are wrinkles and things I generally kind of tone him down.	O
A little bit so there's still wrinkles.	O
But maybe not quite as much as you see here so.	CHITCHAT
That said, We're trying to get a little bit of practice on this subject.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to try to properly illustrate them, take my time to do a better job.	CHITCHAT
Right now, I'm just putting some lines in to show myself where the wrinkles are going to be and then when we start painting.	O

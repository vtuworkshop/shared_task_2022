I'll be able to do the shading and.	O
Paint with this sketch to help me.	O
I heard in a video once that the less folds, the better it reads.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think I think it's true like I think that you can give the idea of the folds without necessarily having an absolute ton of them.	O
If you I feel like if you especially if you focus the folds in like you know for example, the underarm area, or this you know your elbow anywhere, where you're moving and creating this crease, putting a couple fold.	O
There is great, but I really do think it makes for a cleaner image to not over do it.	O
With the clothing folds.	O
So I'm hoping that these studies will make me get you know.	CHITCHAT
Give me a little bit more practice in painting them properly when I do include them.	CHITCHAT
But I don't think that I will in the future be.	CHITCHAT
Still, trying.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I will have a big change with how I how many folds.	CHITCHAT
I generally paint in a scene that makes sense like hopefully, I'll be able to do a better job with them because of this practice, but I still think I kind of prefer not to over do it.	CHITCHAT
Because exactly what Red said it becomes hard to see the form of the person underneath all the wrinkles.	CHITCHAT
There's also a little bit of extra challenge in that bees.	CHITCHAT
The folds and her whole sweater has stripes alittle bit.	O
There's some kind of striping pattern in the texture of the shirt.	O
It's not printed strikes.	O
But like a textured stripe so we'll see if that's going to make it into the painting.	CHITCHAT
I think I'd like to indicate that kind of texture.	O
It looks nice and soft.	O
But also seems like a lot of extra work.	O
So we'll see if we can give a hint of that type of fabric texture without painting every single line.	O
Hopefully we can, we can do that.	CHITCHAT
Just cleaning up my sketch of her finger a little bit.	O
I made it worse.	O
Alright we'll leave that for now.	O
And clean out more in the painting phase.	O
I'm just cleaning up erasing out some of my lines.	O
They aren't Needed.	O
Read says putting less folds to illustrate how the club is wrapping or moving.	CHITCHAT
I think you can start with adding a bunch and try to erase some to the point.	O
Its most readable for you.	CHITCHAT
That's a good way of doing it.	O
See, which ones you can get away without having.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'm sorry read I don't know the exact.	CHITCHAT
The number restriction character limit on the chat.	CHITCHAT
Actually, not sure what it is.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to move her hands up a tiny bit more.	O
It's a little bit higher than I had it.	O
I think a little bit closer to her face.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
200.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Hello fire how are you?	CHITCHAT
I'm using work to just modify my sketch of her face.	O

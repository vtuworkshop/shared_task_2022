The tiny bit like think I think we're ready to start painting.	O
And I don't think that everything is perfect, with this sketch.	O
But I don't consider my sketches to be like a finished line art or something it really is more of a sketch.	O
What I'll do is put it on multiply so it's easier to see through lower the opacity to like 1820% something you know something around there and then lock.	O
The layer press this button right here and that way.	O
If you try to paint on it, it won't allow you so I do this because I'm going to be painting under this layer and just using it as a guide of like where to paint an I don't want to accidentally pay on the sketch layer.	O
Well, I can pass that on that feedback on red so thanks for letting me know.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So we'll save here and we're going on, too.	O
And you A new chapter of this painting so.	O
New layer and I have to decide what order I want to paint things in when I'm painting landscapes.	O
I really like to go back to front.	O
It's just a logical way to do it to paint the Sky first or whatever is furthest away.	O
In this scene, we could do something similar and paint the background first or at least get a base.	O
Kind of color back in there, the only problem I run into when I have a really dark background, which this is a pretty dark.	O
One is once you start painting in a color back there.	O
I'll just do it quick example.	CHITCHAT
Once I start painting in this background.	O
Color then suddenly, we can't see the sketch anymore.	O
And it gets really hard to work.	O
So I think what I'll do is paint in her at least as like a very base base color like will just use a block block.	O
Something in for her.	CHITCHAT
That way we can paint.	O
The background and we can still see our sketch and it will be a little easier, that way so.	O
OK, so I think I will use a soft brush.	O
There's multiple ways to do this.	O
Sometimes if I want to go quickly and fill in a big selection.	O
I'll just take the lasso tool like this select it and just pop pop a paint bucket in like that.	O
That's a really quick way the only downside to this is.	O
You end up with some really sometimes really hard edges to your selection.	O
You can use the feathering on the lasso to help prevent that.	O
But I'm just going to use a soft paint brush to fill in to paint in inside my sketch and the reason for this is I'm hoping to get a nice.	O
Painterly sortof affect to the this artwork.	O
I'd like it to look more hand painted so, so actually painting it in with the brush instead of making a selection it gives a little bit less of A.	O
Technical look to it, it makes it look more handgun so.	O
OK, so now we have a base color an now because of that we can paint behind it, and do things with the background and.	O
It's not a problem we don't sketch doesn't completely disappear, so that's why I'm going in this order.	O
Although I'd really rather do the background first, but now we can do it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
In the background, we have, like a really dark.	O
Really dark areas.	O
In between these leaves and then the leaves kind of like coming out into the light a little bit.	O
So you get a lot of these deep shadows.	O
So I think a good way to paint this, or what might be a little bit of an easier way is to go sort of dark to light so pick a pretty dark color put that in as the base and then on Top of it start painting leaves coming out of the shadows rather than adding the shadows too.	O
To a lighter painting, I think it will be easier to go dark to light.	O
So that's something to think about.	CHITCHAT
Hail avenged thanks for coming over.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
Hi Alexander, I'm doing well thanks.	CHITCHAT
I am excited about this painting actually it's I don't know it has kind of like even though she's wearing modern clothing.	CHITCHAT
She's wearing like this fluffy sweater.	CHITCHAT
I kind of getting like forest.	CHITCHAT
Elf vibes from this reference a little bit with the leaves all over her like it's just very kind of autumn.	CHITCHAT
It's a good feeling so I like this reference.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to start with this dark background, something very dark Brown green something in the middle there.	O
And yeah, you can just use a paint bucket or fill it in however you want.	O

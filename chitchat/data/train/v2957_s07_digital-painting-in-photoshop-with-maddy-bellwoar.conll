But there's our background.	O
I'm going to make a new layer on Top of that.	O
And we can start painting some colors coming out from the background, so for example, you can really take any brush.	O
It depends on what style you want to go for and just start painting.	O
Little little shapes like this, it will start looking like little leaf shapes coming out of the shadows so for me.	O
I think it would be nice to choose brushes that are a little bit.	O
Um textured or have a little bit of a look like it's a real paint brush or something like that.	O
I also recently created a whole pack of brushes that has like foliage shapes and all kinds of stuff like that.	O
Some of those might be handy for a quick for a really quick impression of leaves back there.	O
That would be nice and fast, another thing.	CHITCHAT
Is we can choose to put a blur effect on this background so that's something we can do if you look at the image over here on the right is a little bit of a Leica distance.	O
Blair can you see that, like the Camera lens blur and then over here closer to her.	O
It's nice and in focus, so we can also do that in our painting.	O
Sometimes it's nice to to paint in real quick and then you know you can.	O
Just go to filter blur and use like a gausian blur or lens blur or something like that.	O
There's actually a lot of box blur.	O
There's a lot of options that will work.	O
And you can put this blur filter on so look how quick and easy that is.	O
I honestly I think that fastest and easiest way for me to paint this would be to.	O
Yeah, do 1 layer really quick just scribbling in basically and then go ahead and blur it and then paint on Top.	O
So that's going to be my plan.	CHITCHAT
How do you change pen tryst pencil so quick Hey Quinn so I just if you click up here?	CHITCHAT
To your when you have your brush tool selected you can click up here and it brings the drop down menu for your brushes and you can scroll through them and select them you can even set up keyboard shortcuts to automatically switch you to the next brush or to a previous brush or something like that.	O
But I honestly.	CHITCHAT
I usually just scroll through them and pick them out this way.	O
Thanks, Mohammed.	CHITCHAT
Thank you that would be awesome avenged.	CHITCHAT
I'd love if you would join us on this one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so let me will just go through and pop in some more leaves like this and then will apply a blur and then will paint another layer on Top so I think that will be.	O
Pretty fast way to do this.	O
And if you want you can use a couple different I'm using uh.	O
Like a plant brush.	O
Sometimes it's nice to use a couple different types of shapes to make it look more natural but realistically with the amount of blur.	O
I'm going to put on this, it probably doesn't matter if we really use a lot of different shapes or not.	O
You could probably just also go in with like any shape brush and it would be fine.	O
Another thing you can do is go to edit transform perspective.	O
And maybe keep in mind that it looks like the.	O
The Flowers or plants to the right are getting smaller and the ones getting closer to us on the left.	O
There are bigger just because of the angle how she is against the wall that's something to think about but.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
I will just pay attention to that when I get into the next painting fees.	O
OK let's see what this looks like.	CHITCHAT
Filter blur Gaussian blur Gaussian blur ends up being my favorite most of the time it's just like.	O
A real basic blur.	O
Alright I think that's good.	CHITCHAT
So now I've got blurred background and this is just a base for us to paint on Top of this is just making our job a little bit easier.	O
'cause Can you imagine look at this?	CHITCHAT
How much detail there is coming into this scene having to paint all that it seems a bit overwhelming so having this as a starting point is for me a little bit.	O
More welcoming that we could make a new layer and start painting a little bit nice nicer on Top of it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
For example, let's find.	CHITCHAT

A brush we want to use I like.	O
This one poops let me show you hear this one, it looks like a paintbrush.	O
If you like this brush or any of the brushes.	O
I'm using there are links below in the stream description.	CHITCHAT
And you can go a little bit both ways.	O
You can choose the dark color from The Shadow and start painting.	O
Some of that in there's going to be a little bit of a disconnect at first just a warning when you're painting on Top of this blurred background and you start using a hard edge brush or something like that.	O
It's going to be a bit jarring at first to see those hard edges.	O
It's going to look like it doesn't belong you have to do some more painting to kind of blend the.	O
The out of focus with the more focused if you want a slightly more subtle transition between the two you could use a brush like this one, which has is a little bit softer, it does have hard edge, but it's a little bit softer, so that might.	O
That might feel better, so we can start painting with this one.	O
So I just want to get the background a little bit more far along it's not I don't want to sit here and paint the whole background before starting the character but or the?	O
The woman in the portrait, but I do want to get a little bit more done just because I personally find that.	O
Having the backgrounds at least blocked in well enough, it helps give the idea of the mood and the environment that the person is in because a lot of times lighting and things in the background will affect your character in this scene.	O
Maybe it's not in a really dramatic way, but often you'll see that.	O
Light will bounce off of something let's say if you character standing next to a blue ball or something light will hit that wall and then hit the person and you'll see like a little bit of blue on their skin.	O
For example, or it'll just tint them a little bit.	O
So the environment around whoever your painting if you're doing a portrait for example, is pretty important to consider early on.	O
Even though you it might be way more excited about painting the person and the environment if you do consider it.	O
It will it will pay off will pay off?	CHITCHAT
So just a few more leaves.	O
Then we'll start painting Our Lady and then we'll take a break from the background for a bit and come back to this later.	O
I try to work around the scene kind of.	CHITCHAT
Alright evenly so I don't want to take any one area and make it completely finished.	O
Before the other areas got a chance to have anything done to them.	O
I like to move around to work around the image and slowly.	O
Get everything towards a finished place so that's why we should probably stop here on the background before I get too carried away.	O
Thank you for choosing to work on this ref the sweater seems intimidating Oh you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like this one.	CHITCHAT
I hope it's gonna go well.	CHITCHAT
I think I think it will.	CHITCHAT
This is also a learning experience for me, I'm happy to teach what I do know and share my process, but	CHITCHAT
As we do these paintings of different different subjects.	CHITCHAT
I'm also learning a lot as we go so there might be a little trial and error along the way here.	CHITCHAT
But OK let's get back to Our Lady now.	CHITCHAT
So just looking at her looking at my reference seeing if there's anything since I've been looking at the background for awhile not looking at her sometimes looking back, you will start just notice something different that you didn't notice before so I think I'm just going to add a little bit more width to the sweater on her on the left side.	O
OK and then.	CHITCHAT
Let's start painting.	CHITCHAT
Your color panel looks so cool well.	O
Thank you Bella.	CHITCHAT
It is an extension.	O
It's Coulouris.	O
I'm going to type in the chat for you.	CHITCHAT
If you want to look it up because it's a little bit of A.	CHITCHAT
Weird spelling so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's That's it if you wanted to look it up.	CHITCHAT
I do really like it, although if you have the recent if you have 2019 or 2020 photo shop.	O
You can go to window color and you can get a color wheel with the triangle now in the past.	O
It was the Hue cube like this, which is still available but you can also go here and switch to color wheel.	O
So this is very similar to Coulouris Coolers, a couple extra functions that I don't use often but I have it.	O
So it will use it.	CHITCHAT
But if you really only care about the triangle you can get it through photo shop.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT

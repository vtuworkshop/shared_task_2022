I'm going to let's get into painting her so I'm going to lock the layer.	O
This is a super convenient thing because we have this on its own layer.	O
You can press this little checkerboard icon appear and then when I paint on that layer anything that I do anything that I paint is only going to be allowed to affect that shape that I already created so I don't even have to worry.	O
I can just paint.	O
However, I want then it's going to be in the lines so that's really nice.	O
Because then we can do things like for example, pick a shadow color and kind of just come along the edge and swipe in like this and.	O
It's just only only within that shape.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
See what I was talking about earlier with the colors surrounding the character may be affecting them.	O
I'm noticing now that there's a little bit of a green hint to the color of the shadow on her sweater over here and I think that's a little bit of a reflection of the wall, the plant will next door so.	O
I tend to work.	O
Midtones 1st and then shadows and highlights.	O
So what that means is usually in the early in the early phases of my painting things don't have extremely high contrast usually.	O
It's going to be a little bit dark and then it gets brighter towards when it's getting more finished.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Hi Mads, how are you?	CHITCHAT
And we can choose a warmer color for to start differentiating the skin.	O
From the rest of her and the same for her hair.	O
Choose a Brown.	O
So now we're having a little bit of trouble seeing her head separate from the background.	O
So that's something we can look at later and maybe put some lighter leaves behind her head.	O
So it makes it easier to see or highlights in her hair.	O
We can decide how to do it.	CHITCHAT
But basically one we should probably decide about one thing being slightly later than the other.	O
So we'll be able to see her.	O
Her head more easily.	O
So her hair gets a little bit later towards the edges.	O
A little bit more like Golden warm Brown color.	O
Now there's a lot of different workflows in different ways to go about this.	O
Right now, I'm basically trying to get somewhat of the local color painted in on each area like her hair.	O
Is now a dark Brown her sweater?	CHITCHAT
Is a beige trying to get the right color here?	O
I want to go a little later?	CHITCHAT
And I don't want to get sucked into any little little details on the sweater.	O
Yet like any little wrinkles.	O
I want to look at the big picture so big picture wise her arm is getting late.	O
Splash here and here coming down the middle of course, the light is hitting certain ring.	O
You know certain wrinkles and folds and you're seeing some in shadow, but we're not going to go super into that yet.	O
We just want to establish where the big areas of light are so here.	O
Play is hitting and here.	O
And this arm is a pretty big.	O
Area of way over here.	O
So even my lights are not the brightest they're going to go right now.	O
I want to save that for like.	O
Finishing touches kind of thing at the end, we're going to put in the brightest highlights or maybe not.	O
The very end, but it's something we're working our way up to.	CHITCHAT
There's a hand, I know there's a hand.	O
An extra little challenge.	O
OK, so I'm going to make a new layer.	O
We were painting.	O
All of that basically right on the layer and I'm going to make a new layer now and we're going to make a clipping mask so this is the layer.	O

I'm going to right click, and go to create clipping mask or you can use a shortcut for that.	O
You can hold alt and hover your stylus.	O
In between the new layer and the one you want to clip on to an just press down when you see the arrow icon.	O
Then you have a clipped layer so this is the same thing almost as the lock transparency in the sense that I'm painting, I can only paint in the lines, but I'm painting on a separate layer from my painting, I can move this around they can get rid of it.	O
So it's a little bit of less of a destructive painting method and the nice thing about this is I can paint on this layer and see if I like it if I can see if I like the results before like committing to what I've done so I'm going to switch to the Airbrush.	O
And do a little bit of shading with the airbrush I'm going to put my layer blending mode on multiply because this is really handy for doing shadows multiply blending mode is nice because it it will darken areas.	O
But it also it seems like you've got it tested out and get a feel for it, but	O
It's nice because it preserves more of your detail it darkens everything in it doesn't just like with with a normal mode.	O
If I use this color.	O
It kind of wipes out all detail underneath whereas multiply will darken it.	O
But you'll still be able to see what was already painted so it's a nice way to.	O
Add shadows and modify your painting without having to redo everything.	O
Underneath.	O
Hawaii Gore how are you?	CHITCHAT
I want to pick like a warm dark Brown and I'm going to use that to paint in some shadows and I'm going to take the lasso tool and use it as sort of a stencil so I'm going to use my lasso tool to block off areas that I want to either paint within or I want to avoid painting on so it kind of depends so for example, like this wrinkle over here.	O
I'm going to make a selection of the area that I want to have a shadow and then.	O
Paint in that area.	O
And deselect and now you see that there's a shadow if you want to smudge.	O
You can use the smudge brush if you want to soften that edge a little bit.	O
Height one how are you?	CHITCHAT
In this little there's a little.	CHITCHAT
The wrinkle over here, so I'm going to do the same thing basically and create a little.	O
Block off a little area where I want the darkest shadow to be.	O
And then I just painted in that space.	O
And the nice thing about this is you can create gradients.	O
And like soft shading.	O
And block off areas that you don't want to paint it and so I think it's very nifty.	O
I use it a lot.	CHITCHAT
I use this technique a lot.	CHITCHAT
I think it went a little too, too, dark without wrinkles.	O
So we can just use the airbrush to race out.	O
Also, since we're talking we're doing studies on wrinkles and painting fabric in clothes and things I can say that.	O
A lot of people underestimate how much you can do with just a little bit of Airbrush.	O
Now I really like having textured look to my painting, but I still find that it sometimes it's easy to easier to use the airbrush to create a form.	O
It's almost almost as an effect of like a 3D model sculpt if you do a nice job with the airbrush shading and then you can paint whatever kinds of textures, you'd like on Top.	O
So I'm using the The Airbrush to get me started with putting the.	O
Wrinkles where I want.	O
Yeah, the delay is improved now, so it should be less than before.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it specifically for.	CHITCHAT
For me for streamers in Europe, it's a big improvement.	CHITCHAT
His surplus how are you?	CHITCHAT
Under her arm, we're going to add.	O
A shadow.	O
And that might be an area where we want to leave kind of hard edge or just a blurry a tiny tiny bit.	O
It's reduced there still is a little bit of a delayed rado, but it's more within like.	CHITCHAT

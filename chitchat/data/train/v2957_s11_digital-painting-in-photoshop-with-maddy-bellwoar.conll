I think it's pretty normal amount at this point.	CHITCHAT
There's almost always going to be at least a little bit of a delay with streaming.	CHITCHAT
But it's a more minimal it seems.	CHITCHAT
So tired today have a lot of things to do how are you today I'm doing good?	CHITCHAT
I'm doing better than yesterday yesterday?	CHITCHAT
I was feeling how you were feeling now, I was super tired.	CHITCHAT
I didn't get a very good night of sleep, but last night was much better, so I feel alive feel alive today.	CHITCHAT
So thank you doing, good, I hope I hope your day goes well, Despite that surplus.	CHITCHAT
OK so we've got some wrinkles.	O
And there are a bit dark, but we're going to go back in and do.	O
More detail I can tone it down a little bit.	O
Let's work on the face a little bit and we can use the same kind of techniques here.	O
For example, behind the nose on this side of the face.	O
We want we can put a shadow you can actually do the same thing and make a selection to block off the side of the nose.	O
Like that.	CHITCHAT
I like to use this much brush a lot, too kind of tone down my.	O
My selections so they don't really want a hard edge to be seen there.	O
I want a little bit more of a subtle.	O
Little bit more so look.	CHITCHAT
You can hear the birds in the background.	CHITCHAT
I know it's like such a classic spring day feeling going on right here.	CHITCHAT
It's nice weather outside and.	CHITCHAT
Birds chirping.	CHITCHAT
OK, So what I was talking about earlier.	CHITCHAT
I usually work dark to light this painting is looking pretty muddy and pretty dark right now, but hang with me OK.	O
We're going to get some life into it.	CHITCHAT
I'll show you how I'm going to do that.	CHITCHAT
Last thing I want to do shadow wise before we move on is just a painting her eyebrows.	O
And then will start breaking things up here.	O
Oh also beeping.	CHITCHAT
OK so knew layer and I'll either do this next phase on normal layer mode or sometimes something like overlay.	O
Overlay is really nice layer blending mode for sort of brightening things and giving a little extra saturation to them.	O
I really like it for adding like subsurface, scattering to this skin that little effect of like for example, if you have a light shining from behind someone an going through their ear or something like that, and it gets like a pink color that's the subsurface scattering so.	O
This can be really nice for that kind of effect.	O
Right right we're in We're we're a bit in the ugly phase right now.	O
It's like when the painting just doesn't look like what you intended to look like.	O
But you gotta go through the phases, yeah, so we're going to brighten up her face a little bit.	O
And this will also saturate a little bit give a little bit more color to her skin.	O
I do use the layer blending modes of my painting.	O
Some people prefer to paint all on normal mode.	O
I've been doing that, more and more lately just because I think I've as I get more practice.	CHITCHAT
I've been more likely to just pick colors.	CHITCHAT
I like from the beginning with my painting it's not always the case.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
That being said, I do use layer blending modes a lot to like modify things that I've done and improve them so.	O
Just give a little bit more.	O
More life to this.	O
And then now I'll make a new layer an paints with I'll go back to painting with normal.	O
On a normal layer so I'm picking my own my own colors and everything like that.	O
Versus like letting overlay.	O

Give me surprise what's going to happen.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to choose pink for the lips?	O
Actually, one thing that you can do is color pic from the colour.	O
That's already there, and then modify that Hue shifted to something closer to what you want.	O
Sometimes that'll help get a result, that's not so jarring.	CHITCHAT
Then going to the color wheel picking a random color.	O
All thank you pixel you're so sweet.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I really like her makeup too.	CHITCHAT
I don't usually I usually like painting portraits where if I'm painting a female portrait.	CHITCHAT
For example, like this one.	CHITCHAT
I usually like going really natural and not putting a lot of makeup on it.	O
On the face, but I think her makeup looks really nice and is kind of this natural earthy tones.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
People go with it.	CHITCHAT
So a lot of times at this Phase I will try to get rid of my sketch.	CHITCHAT
This is with, and without the sketch so you can see that I still kind of need it for some information.	CHITCHAT
So here's my compromise.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to duplicate the sketch.	O
So I can save a layer just in case I need to reference.	O
It later but what I'll do is.	O
On the duplicate I'm going to erase out.	O
Anything that I don't think I need any more.	O
I think most of her outfit.	O
The wrinkles are there enough that I don't really need the sketch anymore?	O
The area that I really need it, I think is still her face.	O
Maybe the eyes for example, 'cause I didn't really paint them in at all yet.	O
So I'm just erasing everything that's not needed and then.	O
Whatever is left we can just merge that down.	O
So now that's part of this layer with her now.	O
Everything's on one layer and this is kind of how I go from painting or from drawing to painting phase.	O
Now I'm no longer going to have that sketch on I will have it in case I need it, but most likely.	O
I'm going to leave it off for the rest of the painting and we're just going to go from here so.	O
Now I can go and paint on Top of the original sketch of the eyes and change them and hopefully improve them and not have to go back and forth between layers to do that I can.	O
Just go from here, so right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm working on a new layer above and on normal mode and I'm just going to paint.	O
I should probably stay zoomed out it's so tempting to zoom in because I'm painting her face and I want to be able to see the details but at the same time.	O
This is uh.	CHITCHAT
This image isn't it just about the portrait.	CHITCHAT
There's also a background that her whole sweater and everything so.	O
I'm gonna stay zoomed out.	O
Until we at least get it further along and then I can look at zoom in.	O
And fix little details and things but I don't think we're like, at that step.	O
Yet we didn't we didn't earn our zoom in you guys, we have to paint more before we can zoom in.	O
That's one of the more helpful things that I started doing with my painting is just staying zoomed out until it's.	O
Until you really need to get it in Polish, it up.	O
And that keeps it just likely that you'll have better proportions.	O
Going on with your painting.	O
Right we do see a little light on her chin down here.	O
And let's start painting in the eyes.	O
I might switch brushes, though I'm painting with A brush that's really difficult to do details because it's so soft.	O
So I'm going to choose a harder edge brush.	O
And here we go.	CHITCHAT
Reading a time study on the salon are taking your time.	CHITCHAT
I'm more taking my time on this one hunji.	CHITCHAT
I'm not planning on working on like multiple paintings.	CHITCHAT
During this stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to spend more time on this one and take it to a more finished place.	CHITCHAT

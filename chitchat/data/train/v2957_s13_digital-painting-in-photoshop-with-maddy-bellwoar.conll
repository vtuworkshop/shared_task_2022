I noticed that yesterday yesterday.	CHITCHAT
I was doing some studies these fabric studies and I found them really challenging.	CHITCHAT
And I felt like I needed more time so I'm going to take it a little slower today.	CHITCHAT
Plus, I'd like to actually get a little portrait practice in with this, too, so it's like a double.	CHITCHAT
Study of portrait and.	CHITCHAT
The outfit.	CHITCHAT
Give a little bit more, she's wearing like orange.	O
A bird orange kind of eye shadow, it, fits the autumn vibes around here.	O
I did choose this picture yes.	CHITCHAT
If anybody is you know likes the reference image.	CHITCHAT
You can find it below the stream in the description panel or above the chat and info tab.	CHITCHAT
If you'd like to do a painting with with us you can join in.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I chose this one.	CHITCHAT
Hi pro designer.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good thanks how are you?	CHITCHAT
Alright I'm pretty dumb.	CHITCHAT
Sort of anxious to get in there and paint the face.	CHITCHAT
But I'm going to wait on that and spend a little bit more time looking at the picture as a whole and then will zoom in so first thing I want to do is look at the overall shape of her head because looking at it now.	O
I think I added like a whole bunch of poofy hair to the side for some reason I don't know I like painting fluffy hair big, big flowing hair.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
We're going to stay closer to the reference doesn't have quite as much hair over there.	O
So something more like that.	CHITCHAT
And we can go a little bit warmer get some of the lighter colors on the ends of the hair.	O
And we can also just brighten up overall we can go to image adjust.	O
Curves levels these are always to mess with your brightness and contrast levels and just the overall lights lights and darks in the image and you can improve things with that, so we can just brighten things up.	O
You can also go to color balance.	O
We can look at the shadows that we want things to be more you know tended towards any specific color.	O
Maybe we can give a different feel to it or something more accurate.	O
I think it's helpful to do this along the way as you go.	O
I don't know if I like what I did there, but I was kinda just showing the sliders.	O
I think basically the highlights need to be a little bit more cool.	O
That's one thing that I'm feeling in this.	CHITCHAT
Another thing you can do is you can adjust that through the curves also so we could go to red and maybe like tone down the Red Curves, a little bit.	O
Then the blue.	O
Little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, we've got a lot more painting to do so.	CHITCHAT
Any specific reason about Wednesday streaming.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I just like to stream on a regular schedule.	CHITCHAT
I like to pick a day and.	CHITCHAT
Be able to stick to it, rather than kind of streaming randomly.	CHITCHAT
I know, people have all different kinds of.	CHITCHAT
Schedules and thoughts on that there's a lot of people that stream just like when they have the time.	CHITCHAT
But it helps me to have a schedule so.	CHITCHAT
I like to be able to be here and people if they want can plan to be here if they enjoy the stream.	CHITCHAT
Could you show me what would happen if you do auto color OK?	O
Let's try image adjust?	O
Oh, auto, yeah, auto color there, it is wow.	O
Look how cool that is.	CHITCHAT
It's very, very cool like blue cool.	CHITCHAT

Alright so I want to give a little bit of a highlight to the outside of her head.	O
Just a little bit of a shine, maybe on the hair.	O
I just feel like I'm losing her with the plants behind there, I guess the other option is we could lighten the plants.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
It's just hard to see.	O
See her because she has a dark hair and there's kind of a dark background, so that's a little bit better.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
That right there was a crazy result, sometimes it looks really good when you use the auto tone or auto color, but other times, not as much?	O
OK, so now we're at the the phase in the painting where it doesn't look so hot, however.	O
Everything is in place.	O
So we can go ahead and just render and have fun with painting it and making it look better.	O
The background is there.	O
The characters there.	O
She's got a lot of work to be done.	O
But she's mainly blocked in the proportions are there and?	O
I find this a good place to be in with the painting as far as like.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I've worked through some of the more difficult parts of the set up and now we can tweak some little things and just carry on.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking at the reference and I think I missed out on a little bit of like a tilt to her hand.	O
If you guys see that.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to.	O
Do that little group will tilt.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Make a couple adjustments to where things are wall.	O
Everything is still very malleable because we haven't painted a lot of details anywhere.	O
So I don't feel too.	O
That's too precious to adjust and move things around so.	O
For it.	CHITCHAT
Want to move something over.	O
I'm going to do that.	O
And then we can, we can carry on.	O
I wonder why it was so great this is really intense.	CHITCHAT
One thing that I I mistake I used to make was I would get into details, too soon, mostly just because I you know like anyone I didn't like the ugly stage in the painting.	CHITCHAT
You want things to look good, so I had a hard time working around the painting 'cause I would paint.	CHITCHAT
One area until it was more finished just because I wanted to see it be nice.	CHITCHAT
You know, and what I would end up with is if I wanted to make changes it would be kind of difficult 'cause I had already rendered that area.	CHITCHAT
Lots so making a change like that would have been maybe more troublesome.	CHITCHAT
But we're in the place right now where nothing is too detailed so we can move things around.	CHITCHAT
And then when we were like OK, we're good to go then will start.	CHITCHAT
Start painting some nice shading.	O
So I've been using very soft brushes up to now.	O
I think I'm going to soon switch to some brushes that have a little bit more texture to them and like I was talking about the beginning of the stream.	O
I really like the look of sort of traditional painting.	CHITCHAT
In digital work as well so you know imitation of.	CHITCHAT
Oil painting textures, or watercolor gouache?	CHITCHAT
Why not so I'm probably going to go for more of a oil kind of look here.	CHITCHAT
Merge that down.	O
So let's begin I'm going to take a brush called the soft paint round brush and that's because it's something similar to what you would use the hard round Brush War.	O
But it's just got a little bit more of an interesting shape and a little bit more texture than the hard round brush, but it basically serves the same result.	O
Serves the same purpose.	O
And let's start painting on her face.	O
I will zoom in a little bit.	O
I'm going to zoom in on the reference.	O
I have the reference on my other monitor.	CHITCHAT
Let's see maybe I can flip this too.	O
I don't usually.	CHITCHAT
Bother but Let's see this images.	CHITCHAT
Arrange.	O
I don't remember how to do it quickly but it's one extra step.	O
So I hope you guys don't mind if I don't flip that it's just easier for me, I flip my reference on the other monitor my full size reference.	O

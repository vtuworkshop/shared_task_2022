I do flip that whenever you see me painting with the canvas flipped I'm not just like.	CHITCHAT
That I'm not just like so brilliant that I can flip it in my head.	CHITCHAT
I am looking at the flipped version.	CHITCHAT
On my other monitor so.	CHITCHAT
Well, after getting after zooming in this is a bit more rough than I thought I think I actually will work with the airbrush a tiny bit more guys before going to the texture brush.	O
This is just going to be easier.	O
And then will start going in with texture so.	O
The airbrushes nice I can add color like this.	O
She has a little bit more warm through her skin than what I have here so we'll start with that.	O
On the eyes and the nose.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Mill says in pure ref flip by holding shift alt and dragging the left mouse button in the direction you want to flip.	CHITCHAT
I wonder how many times it will take me to remember that shift alt OK cool.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Mills.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
It's one of those things I gotta commit to my memory because.	CHITCHAT
Probably remember it forget that by the next time Is It.	CHITCHAT
Need to write myself a sticky note.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that was orange, so anyway, yeah, using the The Airbrush to sculpt in give her little shadow under her eyelids.	O
To establish the shape.	O
Up above and below the eyelids.	O
I find the Airbrush and soft brushes really so much more friendly to use for this people have different preferences, you know.	O
I'm I'm kind of at that point where I'm struggling a little bit with deciding making workflow changes because.	CHITCHAT
I do as I was saying, I do like to have a little bit more of that.	CHITCHAT
Painterly, look, but I find that my workflow.	CHITCHAT
I really enjoy working with the airbrush.	O
I like it.	CHITCHAT
It makes me feel almost like I'm creating a 3D model.	O
I just find it really satisfying to get these soft.	O
Shadows and things.	O
So I think my compromise to that is going to be to start.	O
Painting, the using the airbrush method in the early stages, the kind of sculpt in a base for myself and then start using some textured brushes at some point during the?	O
Sort of polishing fees and hopefully get texture that way.	O
We'll see we'll see.	CHITCHAT
I'm still I like to experiment with different workflows and use.	CHITCHAT
These studies in order to do it, so I can try new things.	CHITCHAT
I think he Mills.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's nice.	CHITCHAT
Welcome everybody if anybody is watching or listening and you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to ask me.	CHITCHAT
I like to explain as I go.	CHITCHAT
But if there's anything.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing and you're wondering about it, you can just let me know.	CHITCHAT
And also, if you'd like to see or use the reference image.	CHITCHAT
You can find a link to it below the stream or in the info tab.	CHITCHAT
Anyone is welcome to paint along I like to do group studies during my streams.	CHITCHAT
So I am studying this image, doing a little painting of it and if you'd like to also do a study of her.	CHITCHAT
You can take the reference and you're welcome to share whatever you do you can post it in the chat?	CHITCHAT
If you like.	CHITCHAT
OK so this is a before and after of a few minutes of painting with the airbrush so it's still.	CHITCHAT
In the early stages, but you can see that something's happening here we're getting we're getting somewhere.	CHITCHAT
We're cleaning things up.	O
I also like to use the lasso an airbrush combination or things like nostrils and.	O
The space in between the mouth, so let me show you an example.	O
So I'm going to make a selection of the nostril shape.	O
Because generally when you're painting noses an nostrils.	O
You'll get the effect where there's a dark shadow.	O
You're seeing like up inside the nose and so you'll get a dark shadow that kind of fades out so if you make a selection, but select more than you need on the bottom half, so you just get a hard edge on Top you can do something like this.	O
Just using the airbrush to shade in.	O
And then let the bottom the Microsoft sort of dissolve and then deselect and you have something like this.	O
And we need to do more.	O
More work on the nose, but not realize I think it's pretty fast way to do that.	O

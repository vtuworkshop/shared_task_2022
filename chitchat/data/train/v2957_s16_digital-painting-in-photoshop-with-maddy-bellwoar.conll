Grampa airbrush racer OK and then for the.	O
For the lips for the mouth.	O
You can do something similar and just make a selection tracing along what you want to be the.	O
The bottom of the Top lip for example.	O
And then when you have this election need.	O
And you can hold the shift to add to your selection and all to subtract from it.	O
Once you have your selection.	O
You can then take the Airbrush and just kind of run it along there.	O
And then deselect and you have.	O
Align.	O
Sometimes they'll take me a couple goes you know to decide what shape I want you can use warp and move it around sometimes you get it, the first time.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes not.	CHITCHAT
Um charity has more character thank you.	CHITCHAT
What is your favorite tool in Photoshop except the brush tool?	CHITCHAT
Well, this might be?	CHITCHAT
This might be an obvious answer at the moment but probably the lasso tool probably the last air tool.	CHITCHAT
I guess also having layers of course, I also do traditional art so I.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, in traditional art, I missed having layers for sure.	CHITCHAT
So I mean, you can layer things.	CHITCHAT
But you can't then go and take a layer from your background of your traditional painting and move it around so it would probably be either having layers or the lasso tool.	CHITCHAT
I use those both like obviously constantly.	CHITCHAT
Unbelievable, I was killed myself to make it knows Oh well.	CHITCHAT
I hope that I hope you can use this.	CHITCHAT
I hope you can use this.	CHITCHAT
It's yeah, it was really handy for me.	CHITCHAT
Also, the eyelids.	O
You can do something similar so let me make a selection above the eyelid for example, got a hard edge, there now we can take the.	O
The Airbrush and just go along the edge of the eyelid and deselect so you can see the before and after you can also see that there's a big?	O
Different sometimes in the lasso tool versus the brush that it's not so smooth, sometimes you get little like aliased edges, you can just use the?	O
It's much brush to soften it.	O
Control Z for you read.	O
I know control Z is definitely something I miss in traditional, although to be honest.	CHITCHAT
I don't miss it as much as some other things because I I painted in Gouache, so mostly I can paint over if I make a mistake.	CHITCHAT
So it's not so much the end of the world I missed some of the other convenience tools, even more than controls the older that's of course, a big one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so yeah, I'm glad that helps yeah, so you can you can use that kind of method to add it's like a bit of a spray paints kind of approach and you can do it below the lips.	CHITCHAT
I would really suggest, though I mean, depending on what style you want I would suggest using the.	O
Airbrush airbrush lasso tool combination with the smudge tool because you're just going to end up with some really, really hard edges and you might want to have a smudge brush to go back in and soften it.	O
I like the combination of I like having a smudge brush where you can soften in some places an leave a hard edge in other places, if you want to.	O
You don't have to completely soften it everywhere.	O
You can leave leave a hard edge that kind of fades.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm too often like I want to try this, but if I ruin everything.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, sometimes if I'm painting and environment and you have your whole background and then you're going to add like one tree in front like Bob Ross style.	CHITCHAT
That's always.	CHITCHAT
Nerve wracking moments and there's Photoshop.	CHITCHAT
It's like no problem.	CHITCHAT
We can just move it.	CHITCHAT
Erase delay take away the layer and release it.	CHITCHAT
Definitely.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we've got.	O
A face we'd still need to do more here, but It's going I'm just noticing now also her.	O
Her eyelids, I'd like to move them up a little bit more.	O
This is another fun thing to do in photo shop, so I copied her eyelid onto a new layer.	O
There's many ways to do this you can just use liquify tool or something but I just found that I like to do it this way.	O
So I copied her bottom eyelid on to a new layer and just kind of warped it and pulled it up over Top of her eye.	O
A little bit.	O
She just has this little bit of a squint you know it's kind of like the typical model squint going on.	CHITCHAT

And so I didn't really get that in my initial painting.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I pulled her.	CHITCHAT
I let her eyelid bottom eyelid up over a little bit and I think it gives her a better.	O
You know squint.	CHITCHAT
So that's fine will use that?	CHITCHAT
So let's zoom out, we've been zoomed in for awhile as much as I'm actually really enjoying working on the face.	O
I want to work on this whole image and what I was saying earlier is it's important to work around the image and not get too zoned in on one area and leave other areas neglected in your painting so.	O
I'm going to keep going.	O
But we're going to stay zoomed out and I will paint with the whole scene in mind, not just her, her face.	O
So I will do a little bit more painting on her.	O
Her head, but we're staying zoomed out or staying zoomed out for a bit.	O
And we're going to work on the outfit too.	O
She has this little leaf tucked by her ear, I didn't even paint that in yet.	O
That's going to be something to do soon I think.	CHITCHAT
We see up in between her, her, her apart.	O
So let's give a little peek like that.	O
And maybe a little bit more at the Top of her head.	O
Keep going back and forth 'cause earlier, I had painted in too much.	O
Earlier, I had too much hair.	CHITCHAT
Now, not enough.	CHITCHAT
High rock is how are you?	CHITCHAT
We can add a little bit of machine to the hair, too.	CHITCHAT
There's like a grey grey blue highlight nice shines or her hair and around her part.	O
You can give the look that her hair like sort of curls around.	O
There's a lot of different ways, you can do this since I was kind of showing this whole lasso tool technique.	O
I can show a way that you can use that for this purpose.	O
You can take your lasso tool and make like a shape you can kind of make a squiggly shape.	O
If you want to have a lot of little hair strands, catching the light so you can just kind of.	O
Do this.	O
And maybe some of these curling ones, and then let's pick, a Gray we've got our airbrush and.	O
Just paint in lately.	O
And usually want the darkest part being around the middle of that and then you have.	O
A little.	O
Shine in the hair now in the past.	O
I've done some stylized almost like anime style artwork.	O
San in this case, I would leave the shine very.	O
Sharp.	O
But for something like this, I think it's nice to blur it out a little bit.	O
'cause I'm trying to paint.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm not trying to paint in the anime style or something at the moment.	O
This reference is not hard it's a really hard.	CHITCHAT
I'm so sorry uh.	CHITCHAT
I'm definitely I'm definitely feeling that this is a difficult one like I keep looking at her and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm just going to keep going.	CHITCHAT
Hum what did you think of the 2 Wallpapers.	CHITCHAT
I shared in discord?	CHITCHAT
I don't think I saw them Reaper?	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry?	CHITCHAT
You can post one in the chat if you want me to take a look at it.	CHITCHAT
I don't always see everything in there, you can always tag me if you like really want to make sure that I don't miss something though.	CHITCHAT
You guys give me one quick moment I need to grab a tissue.	CHITCHAT
I'm still here.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'll be.	CHITCHAT
I'll be right back.	CHITCHAT
I'll just be a quick moment.	CHITCHAT
OK thanks for waiting.	CHITCHAT
Let me check the link of rebirth shared.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is cool.	CHITCHAT
So what is the symbol from?	CHITCHAT
It says in the URL Empire emblem, so I'm not sure what that is if it's a game or something but this is really cool.	CHITCHAT

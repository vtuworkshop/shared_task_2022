I like the texture on this.	CHITCHAT
It makes it look very old like it's from like an old temple or something.	CHITCHAT
Really really pretty warm and cool colors.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like that, a lot, that's a very nice looking wallpaper.	CHITCHAT
OK let's let's keep going on the painting.	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look again at our curves.	O
I feel like I want to.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I was going to keep painting I do want to darken things but I'm not sure.	O
It was from Star Wars Nice.	CHITCHAT
Some kind of not really super in the loop with Star Wars I've seen like the classic movies.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
It's been awhile.	CHITCHAT
I haven't really kept up with the new ones.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's Let's go.	CHITCHAT
So new layer I think it is finally time I know I said that earlier, but I think it's finally time I can start using some more interesting brushes.	O
Let's see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully it's not going to flatten things out.	O
I find it easier to get a 3D look to my work when I use the airbrush, but I really want to enjoy some more textures in my work so.	O
This was my whole plan.	O
Let's see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
The idea was start with the Airbrush.	O
So you can use it as a tool that I find pretty effective for shading.	O
And then at some point.	O
Like now for example, we're going to switch to continuing our rendering with some textured brushes and there's variety of different brushes.	O
That I have that are supposed to emulate traditional kinds of textures, so I'm just going to.	O
I'm just going to take a couple moments to try things out and find one that I think is going to work well for this type of texture of her sweater.	O
I'm trying your textured brush from your free brushes.	O
Um there's a texture paint and let's see.	CHITCHAT
Rectangle texture.	O
I'm not sure which one exactly you're using I have.	CHITCHAT
I changed the names of the brushes at one point from one of the old versions of the brush pack to one of the newer ones.	O
I changed the name 'cause.	O
I was trying to make them a little bit more.	O
Descriptive some of the original names were not very helpful.	O
Do you only painting or other work in designing only painting illustrate illustration?	CHITCHAT
I don't do design work?	CHITCHAT
I don't really have any specific knowledge in that area, so while I have done a couple.	CHITCHAT
I have done some logos and things in the past they were more illustrated logos.	CHITCHAT
Not very designed logo so for example, I did the type of logo where there was an illustration of the person in the logo like if you know the brands like the Quaker Oats guy or Aunt Jemima or something like that.	CHITCHAT
Those brands that have like a portrait in their logo.	CHITCHAT
I've done a couple like.	CHITCHAT
A few of those type of designs for people that wanted that.	CHITCHAT
But other than that I don't do like a nice clean style logos or that type of design.	CHITCHAT
It takes a whole different area of expertise, which I would.	CHITCHAT
I would it would be really awesome to be able to do.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's not something that I do.	CHITCHAT
My passion is more in painting, though I do appreciate good design.	CHITCHAT
And I'd super handy to be able to do as well because a lot of artists are also you're kind of your own.	CHITCHAT
You need to be your own brand and marketing and everything so.	CHITCHAT
Being able to create some of those things for Yourself is really nice.	CHITCHAT
That's something that I found a little difficult over the years.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I don't know that I'm really loving this texture, yet, but part of the issue.	CHITCHAT
Is sometimes when you first introduce a new texture?	CHITCHAT
It looks really wrong when there's only one area that's utilizing that texture.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you gotta commit a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
And before you can really tell what it's going to look like I have the feeling that if I keep going.	CHITCHAT
We're going to get better results.	CHITCHAT
Then just looking at one little corner.	CHITCHAT
Another thing that I have.	CHITCHAT

Learned and I'm trying to put into effect is the idea that you don't have to paint detail everywhere.	CHITCHAT
You can leave some areas pretty smooth and you can focus your areas of detail and texture in places in the painting where well basically there's 2 main places.	O
You can focus your detail and texture.	O
One is anywhere near your focal point, so for example, the focal point will be her face and around her face.	O
The more complicated area of the painting is her hand or face maybe these Flowers.	O
Leaves to the side of her so anything up here.	O
We want to focus more detail and more time and more texture.	O
And so like her sweater near her hand that will be probably the most detailed part of the sweater that we paint.	O
Also anywhere where there's high contrast.	O
Where there's a transition between Shadow and highlight that's also a good opportunity to show texture because the texture becomes more obvious in that area, so those are 2 places where I'm going to try to focus my painting of the texture of the sweater.	O
And we'll see we'll see how that goes.	CHITCHAT
If you end up painting equal texture everywhere, you end up with.	O
Well, either you could end up with maybe like a very, very realistic.	O
Looking painting if you're going for hyper realism or you really want.	O
That level of detail but sometimes it can also detract from your focal point because you really want.	O
One area of painting.	CHITCHAT
One area of your painting to catch the eye of your viewer and be like the area that they engaged with first.	O
And so having that one area be more detailed and more.	O
More textured more contrast more interesting and that's going to benefit you.	O
So there's a lot of good reasons, not to over do it with the detail not to mention we could save some time maybe.	O
I'm flipping my canvas a lot.	CHITCHAT
I do this mostly when I'm painting portraits.	CHITCHAT
I'll still do it.	CHITCHAT
When I'm painting environments.	CHITCHAT
But when I do portraits.	CHITCHAT
That's when you really see me, flipping the canvas.	CHITCHAT
All the time so I hope it's not annoying to watch it.	CHITCHAT
So it helps me see mistakes more easily.	CHITCHAT
When you're looking at something for awhile sometimes you.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if your brain like stop seeing things anymore.	CHITCHAT
When you flip the canvas it kind of tricks your brain into reprocessing the image and you can see, things a little differently.	O
Sometimes that's when you'll notice that something is a little bit wonky.	O
So I've done all this detailing on a separate layer.	O
'cause I wasn't sure how is going to like it?	CHITCHAT
I didn't know if I wanted to commit to this.	O
Method.	O
One thing you can do is lower, the Opacity and that takes away some of the intensity.	O
I really like, how it looks here.	CHITCHAT
But I'm not a big fan of this area.	CHITCHAT
I think maybe I just started to get more of the hang of it as I went on, but	O
One thing I could do is maybe erase out or soften the shoulder or just take it away.	O
Maybe I should just.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I get rid of that didn't really like, how it looked.	O
Hey geovanna, um more vector illustration person, but sometimes it miss, this character.	CHITCHAT
That's painted textures, brain do you have any specific tips to help with that?	CHITCHAT
Well, uhm.	CHITCHAT
I'm not very experienced with vector illustration so.	CHITCHAT
I don't know, um about.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I'd love to help but I don't know if I have any good tips for bringing textures into vector illustration just because I don't do much of that.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
If you're if you're just talking about in painting in general.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I could suggest maybe playing with some different.	CHITCHAT
Playing with some different brushes or playing with some different like you can clip some textures or patterns on to your like if you do more stylized work or if you do more like in vector work.	CHITCHAT
Maybe you can still clip some kind of.	CHITCHAT
Textures are patterns on Top of some of your characters, either like clothing or hair or something where it might fit.	CHITCHAT
So the for flipping the canvas.	O
You have to set up the shortcut.	O
It's not automatically a shortcut by default Sebastian, but if you go to edit.	O
Keyboard shortcuts.	O
You can set it up for yourself, it's under.	O

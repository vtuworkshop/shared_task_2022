Let's see I think it's under tools hold on.	O
Let me see if I can find a real quick.	CHITCHAT
220.	O
No, it's under.	O
Application menus that's right so you can go to image.	O
Flip horizontal so yeah.	O
Application menus.	O
And then Scroll down to image flip horizontal and I set it to control F because I feel like that's pretty easy to remember for flip.	O
But you could pick something else.	O
Now this flips your whole canvas.	O
There's another shortcut.	O
You can also use if you like.	O
You can go to view instead of flipping the whole canvas you can go to view.	O
And there should be a I may have just scrolled past it, but there's a way to flip your view horizontally.	O
And this yeah, here we go flip horizontal you can use this, if you want instead and it will be a little bit easier on your computer to do it.	O
This way or its uses less processing power because it's kind of flipping the view.	O
It's not really like actually flipping your canvas so if you ever are working with like tons of layers and you find that flipping your canvas is causing a big lag you can choose this instead and then?	O
It will be a little bit better.	O
Hey George welcome.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to keep going.	O
With this little texture up here.	O
But I'm not quite sold that this is the right.	O
But this is the right texture for me to use this feels extremely labor intensive which maybe it just might be.	O
Maybe it might be to paint this way.	CHITCHAT
But I think it's more an issue of I haven't figured out the right balance of.	O
How much texture to have or not have in this in this painting yet?	O
I also have a brush called rectangle texture.	O
That's has some texture to it, but it's more of A.	O
Brush that I used to block things in this could be a nice one because it has a harder edge.	O
So it's not.	O
Going to leave so many of these ragged paintbrush stipends.	O
Thanks anyway, my experiment painting, some textures are vectors using your brushes see how that goes you have that could be fun.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't able to give a good.	CHITCHAT
Good advice for vector painting, but that could be that could be something that might work worth trying anyway, sometimes when you try something new like that, it gives you another idea you know anytime you experiment like that.	CHITCHAT
Even if it doesn't work, maybe trigger some other kind of idea for you.	CHITCHAT
OK, I kind of like this sort of stylised.	O
Pattern.	O
With the square brush.	O
Doesn't necessarily look super realistic but?	O
It has something cool.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Jackson says they have the flip canvas shortcut on F4I use it pretty much every 5 minutes or even less.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm using it really often.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm using it really often.	CHITCHAT
Oh.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad I'm not the only one.	CHITCHAT
It's only when I'm streaming is I get a little bit self conscious about it.	CHITCHAT
'cause I feel like you guys are like watching a little dance over here, she's moving.	CHITCHAT
All you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
Hi Ahmed love your painting Oh.	CHITCHAT
Thank you like you're touching designs is a very kind of you thank you.	CHITCHAT
Today we're doing something a little bit different.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm trying to study the.	O
The folds and textures on her sweater, I don't usually paint.	O
I don't usually paint so detailed when it comes to clothing.	O
We were talking about earlier.	CHITCHAT
I usually like to kind of tone down the folds and things, including 'cause.	O
I find it to be sometimes really distracting from the character, but I'm trying to get better with these textures.	O
So we're practicing this anybody who wants to you're welcome to grab the reference image and do a little study with us.	CHITCHAT
If you feel inspired if you like the reference you can join in.	CHITCHAT
And you're welcome to share any.	CHITCHAT
Paintings or sketches, you do.	CHITCHAT
In the chat.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be working on this for probably a few hours say.	CHITCHAT
Let's see how long has it been.	CHITCHAT
We've been.	CHITCHAT
Working on this for a little under 2 hours.	CHITCHAT
Now we started from a blank page.	O
At the beginning of this stream so if anybody missed the beginning and you're curious how we got here, you can always check it out later after the stream is done.	CHITCHAT

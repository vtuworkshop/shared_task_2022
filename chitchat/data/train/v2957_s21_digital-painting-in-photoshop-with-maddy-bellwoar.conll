If you go to my page here on Behance.	CHITCHAT
There's a videos tab and you can see all the past livestreams and it's really nice.	CHITCHAT
There's a tool timeline that I have running here.	CHITCHAT
So later when you're watching if you watch the replay.	CHITCHAT
You'll see whatever tools.	CHITCHAT
I'm using the tool timeline is going to show that so there's one really nice thing about watching the replays actually but yeah, you can see this from the beginning, but I'm going to be working on it for a bit longer.	CHITCHAT
I hope to take this through a nice.	CHITCHAT
And Nice.	CHITCHAT
Somewhat level of Polish by the end of stream.	CHITCHAT
Within reason you know, there's only so much you can do with the.	CHITCHAT
4 or 5 hours but.	CHITCHAT
I think we can I think we've gotten through some of the more difficult parts of this and we can have fun with polishing it up and making it look nice.	CHITCHAT
Now we're just doing texturing.	O
Um Hey bam, how are you?	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good day mill says I prefer regular flipping.	CHITCHAT
I think it helps learn more about composition and balance.	CHITCHAT
OK, cool.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm glad you think I'm glad you feel that way, and it's not annoying.	CHITCHAT
It definitely helps me so.	CHITCHAT
I like this.	CHITCHAT
I like what the texture is doing here, although I have to admit, I don't know if it's coming across to you guys, but the texture.	O
I'm giving to her shirt is making it look almost like she has sequins on her shirt or that it's made from a more reflective kind of material.	O
I don't really mind that so much.	CHITCHAT
My concern is more with making the folds look good, then that the texture of material looks exactly like the reference.	O
It's kind of glamorous.	O
I like it was looking a little shiny.	O
We're given her whole new outfit.	O
We'll see how it goes by the time we end up putting another layer of.	O
Of detailing in my we may end up giving some texture that makes it look more soft again.	O
It's definitely having a better reflective quality right now.	O
So there's a theme here.	O
I don't know if I should bother with it or not.	CHITCHAT
I know I really like painting, shiny textures.	CHITCHAT
They're just fun just fun to paint.	CHITCHAT
So she got a little seem here on the sweater.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
See no problem, including it.	CHITCHAT
All breaking art I'm sorry, you're feeling sick.	CHITCHAT
Well, I guess on the bright side we get to hang out with you today.	CHITCHAT
But I hope you feel better.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's nice it's nice.	CHITCHAT
I enjoy streaming here and on switch there's a few things that I really like about streaming on be hands.	CHITCHAT
I was just talking about one a few minutes ago so I'm sorry if you already heard me talking about this.	CHITCHAT
But there's a really cool feature here called the tool timeline behind so some ways of like integrating the stream with photo shop so this plugin is like capturing my tools that I'm using like the colours that I'm picking.	CHITCHAT
Different things like that and.	CHITCHAT
If you watch the replay of the stream later you'll be able to see a replay of along with the video of all the tools that I'm using as I'm using them so if anybody's ever like having trouble following along or you want to learn a little bit more about that.	CHITCHAT
That's a really, really handy tool.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's been really nice.	CHITCHAT
Usually, when I'm streaming here on Wednesdays, I take a little bit more of a less of a speed painting approach and I try to.	CHITCHAT
To spend a little bit more time on an individual painting, I do a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Quick studies overall, but I like to take some time and.	CHITCHAT
Go through more of a full process and it's nice to be able to show some more of the finishing.	CHITCHAT
Affects and things and you guys always welcome to ask if I do something and you wanted to know what I did I tried to explain things as I go, but sometimes I miss stuff so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if you turn this later on, and off.	CHITCHAT

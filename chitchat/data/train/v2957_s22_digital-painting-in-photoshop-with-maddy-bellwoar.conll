We're just seeing the progress I think it's really fun to work on the separate layer like that and be able to.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's like the little layer visibility on and off and see the progress.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit encouraging 'cause otherwise, it kind of feels like you're just detailing forever, but Hey Sarah, how are you?	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about you the other day.	CHITCHAT
I was drinking some of that rose tea.	CHITCHAT
It's really good it smells really good.	CHITCHAT
Or afternoon, yeah, we are in the afternoon now at least where I am I know a lot of us are in very different places different time zones.	CHITCHAT
I'm in the Netherlands so I'm in.	CHITCHAT
C ET time for anyone wondering.	CHITCHAT
I'm originally from the US so.	CHITCHAT
I spent most of my life in EST time I grew up in Florida and spent most of my life there so.	CHITCHAT
Alright, you also like rose tea, yeah, thanks to thanks to bail.	CHITCHAT
I was introduced to it.	CHITCHAT
How are you keeping the reference image on the left the reference images?	O
I'm using something called pure ref.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
You can Google, it there's the name it's separate from photo shop and it is.	O
You can download it's technically free or you can make a donation when you download it so.	O
It's really, really handy for making reference boards mood boards, putting holding a reference above your other software and things like that.	O
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry bill I had a kind of rough night of sleep couple nights ago.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry to hear that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no problem.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm starting to feel like we've been working on the sweater for a little while now.	CHITCHAT
As I was saying earlier.	CHITCHAT
I like to work around the painting and not spend too long on any one area and then let the other areas kind of fall behind.	O
I want them to all be kind of working up towards a finished place with a relatively equal level of Polish as they go.	O
I still feel like the sweater needs a lot of work.	O
But I probably will just spend a little bit longer on it, and then go back and work on the face a little bit more.	O
It's also just a personal preference thing I feel that I keep from getting bored on longer projects by moving around like that.	CHITCHAT
I think if I if I stick rendering.	CHITCHAT
One area for too long, especially when it's sort of a just a texture like what I'm doing here.	CHITCHAT
I kind of can get a little burned out on that so.	CHITCHAT
We're going to.	CHITCHAT
Move around seeing here soon.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh that's so cool red, I didn't realize that about you.	CHITCHAT
That's very interesting.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's kind of new to me, but I like it.	CHITCHAT
I've always liked the scent but.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So the one area that's bothering me is these shadows here.	O
I think if we can improve.	O
This then I'll be happy to move on.	CHITCHAT
These shadows are just I guess a little bit, too, dark or something.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's OK for them to have dark shadows, but not quite that much.	O
I don't know it's just really attracting my attention.	CHITCHAT
Take these little shadows.	O
Jackson hi how are you?	CHITCHAT

Welcome.	CHITCHAT
You guys are welcome to correct me if I miss pronounce any of your names.	CHITCHAT
Please do.	CHITCHAT
Quick question how do you flip image high Andres you can set it up as a keyboard shortcut it's not a default one but if you go to image.	O
Oh, sorry wrong?	CHITCHAT
Don't go to image go to edit keyboard shortcuts and then you can go to panel menus.	O
And then I use.	CHITCHAT
A merit, yeah, yeah, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Am I telling you to go to the wrong place.	CHITCHAT
I literally just did this Oh application menus.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Go to application menus.	CHITCHAT
Go to application menus and then you can go through image.	O
Image rotation.	O
I can.	CHITCHAT
Go to flip canvas horizontal and press.	O
CTRL F if you want the same shortcut that I have.	O
I just like CTRL F because it's very easy to remember for flip?	O
It's just one of those things that I set up and then I don't usually have to go back to it.	O
Once you set it up, you're good to go you know.	O
Anyway let's go back to the painting.	CHITCHAT
I just want to try to fix this one area and then we'll.	O
Work on the face of it more.	O
Oh, you're welcome, I hope it helps I use that all the time it's like one of my most used.	CHITCHAT
Shortcuts.	CHITCHAT
You can certainly go to image image rotation flip horizontal you can do it.	O
This way too.	O
But if you use it as much as I do you're probably going to want to set shortcut for it.	CHITCHAT
Well, if anybody is working on this one, I hope it's going OK.	CHITCHAT
I hope it's going well.	CHITCHAT
Even I find that's references.	CHITCHAT
Is a pretty tricky one with a lot of details so?	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to just enjoy enjoy the process.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy the learning process.	CHITCHAT
OK, well, I think I finally I'm going to merge this down you guys that's a big move.	O
Big move so this has been on its own layer, but I think I'm committed enough to this texture.	O
I'm just going to merge it down so my layers, so far consist of the background.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Person and the sketch, which is now really not used anymore.	O
I have the layer visibility turned off for it, but I'm just saving it because.	O
I don't know sometimes I like to refer back to the sketch at some point.	O
Hi Emily welcome.	CHITCHAT
Flipping is the best thing to check your drawing.	O
Yeah, it's super helpful another thing.	CHITCHAT
I like to do is turn.	O
My artwork into black and white and that will help see what's going on with your values like the darks and lights in your painting before even turning it into black and white.	O
I am already aware that her face needs brighter highlights.	O
I basically have worked on the.	O
The sweater, but not her face for awhile now but it becomes even more obvious if you if you turn your reference into black and white and the.	O
Yeah, if I look at the reference.	O
Versus my painting, you can really see the difference it needs more contrast and more brightness, but it will get there.	O
So Hi Richard Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Oh, Noes avenged I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Oliver I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
It's going somewhere took some liberties on this one.	CHITCHAT
I do not blame you and that's not a bad thing.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to have a little sympathy here and think about my next moves.	CHITCHAT
OK, we're going to work on her face.	O
We're going to zoom in.	O
I'm going to zoom in I try not to zoom in too much.	CHITCHAT

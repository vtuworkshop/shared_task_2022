But when it comes to painting the face.	CHITCHAT
We're going to finally do it.	CHITCHAT
So we will make a new layer and paint on that layer to make adjustments and things because I think it's just feels a little safer feel a little safer in case we don't like what we do, we can.	O
You know change it, so we don't have to commit yet so her finger as you can see in the reference or fingers, pushing in under her cheekbone kind of where your Kind of where you're like, maybe a dimple would be anyway, so.	O
I'm just going to.	O
Give her a little bit more dramatic.	O
Like impression of the finger.	O
The sweater texture is amazing.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Yay I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it looks a bit more reflective than the photo, but I kind of like I think it's kind of cool, it looks.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I think has a glamorous kind of look.	CHITCHAT
It's a little.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit different, maybe but I like it so I'm going to go with it.	CHITCHAT
Um wanted to paint the girl with the Yellow Shirt but then you said.	CHITCHAT
You chose this ref and I was like OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna do this Oh.	CHITCHAT
I'm I picked the hard one.	CHITCHAT
It is a pretty one, though, isn't it?	CHITCHAT
Uhm I have some ideas, I have some ideas bail.	CHITCHAT
I don't usually.	CHITCHAT
Riville them anyway and when we get closer I will I will.	CHITCHAT
Maybe talk about some things.	CHITCHAT
But I usually like to have mostly surprise anyway.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, that's crazy that that is.	CHITCHAT
Coming up so soon.	CHITCHAT
Looks like crushed velvet, but also it's needed.	CHITCHAT
Well, thank you.	CHITCHAT
So I'm using the airbrush to start with when I feel a little bit happier with the overall.	O
Color shading highlights on her face then I will probably switch to a harder brush for more texture.	O
But right now, we're still I'm like still trying to be satisfied with her face structure and overall where the colors and things are so once that's sorted out, then will probably move away from the.	O
The Airbrush just like we did with her jacket sweater.	O
So she has a bit of a shadow under her, her eye and it's not like she has.	O
I mean to me, it just looks like the shape of her.	O
As the shape of her eyelid.	O
It's not so much that she has circles or bags under her eyes.	O
It's a combination of her eye shape and that she's squinting a little bit.	O
So if we do want to get that Squint feeling then we have to go ahead and like include this shadow under here.	O
So we don't over do it.	O
'cause then I think it will make her look like she's tired or something.	O
But a little bit of it is just going to give us a proper amount of squint I hope.	O
I thought it was a waffle texture, but it's not it might just be hungry.	CHITCHAT
I could go for a waffle right now, I don't blame you.	CHITCHAT
I do not blame you.	CHITCHAT
And Hey Clever, Give a little highlight to her nose kind of pop that out, a little bit.	CHITCHAT
So I want to get this little wing of her nose over here on this side, so that her nose looks more symmetrical.	O
Yeah, before and after.	O
Maybe I invented things a little too much over here.	O
So I'm using airbrush I'm just color picking I'm holding alts to bring up the color.	O

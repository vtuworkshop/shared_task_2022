Picker and dragging colors, a little bit back and forth across each other, too, like blend the colors together and.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Quite refined for 2 hours of work very nice glad I got to see the sweater details all thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you're right, it's not too bad for 2 hours earlier.	CHITCHAT
I was feeling a bit.	CHITCHAT
Oh man she had.	CHITCHAT
We had a bit of a ugly stage at the early part of this painting with the you know, blocking in her face and everything you know how it is.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
We're getting through we're getting through there, I'm feeling better about it now thank you.	CHITCHAT
Little shadow to the eyebrows.	O
It's also nice to use I was talking about this earlier, but you can use layer blending modes like multiply and that way.	O
When you add a little bit more shadow for example, around the.	O
The eye or the eyelid if you want to add some more depth to that it will add the darkness, but not completely cover?	O
What you've already painted as if you were painting on a normal layer that might just kind of cover it up, but using multiply or something it still leaves that detail there and just kind of adds to it.	O
So I like to use it.	CHITCHAT
When I've already painted a bit and I just want to modify things slightly.	O
And her mouth definitely needs.	O
I need to get in there and paint you can actually see.	O
Sort of into her, her mouth a little bit her lips are parted so we're going to want to get zoom in there and paint that.	O
I'll pick a little bit more of a saturated color for around the lips.	O
So are you guys at all familiar with.	CHITCHAT
Color zones when it comes to painting portraits or faces or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
This is something that was relatively new to me over the past couple years I started learning about this.	CHITCHAT
Via just online tutorials and things and I can show a quick example of what I'm talking about 'cause I think it might be easier than.	CHITCHAT
Trying to Explain it with words.	CHITCHAT
So this would be a quick example.	CHITCHAT
Of the color zones if you see if you take a look at paintings, especially like classical oil paintings.	O
You'll see that.	O
Even though this is a very dramatic.	O
Example, a lot of times these areas, the face will have a slight tint to them.	O
I can put the link to this in the chat in case anybody wants to look more closely.	CHITCHAT
But the idea is to give a little bit more life to the skin.	O
You can pay attention to those zones when you're shading.	O
And sometimes it's just it can be overdone.	O
So you don't want to go too far with it, but I've noticed that can really help.	O
Struggle on the lower part of the face like shading the sides of the mouth.	O
Chin lower cheek.	O
Part yeah that's really hard in this one revenge because of her hand.	O
Blocking I should actually start painting her hand next because surprise surprise.	CHITCHAT
That's the part.	CHITCHAT
I'm procrastinating on and I can't really figure out any of the other areas of behind there.	CHITCHAT
Until I figure out how much the hand is going to be blocking for example, but	CHITCHAT
Well let's get to that, but well before we do that.	CHITCHAT
I'll do one will put a layer on either overlay or soft light and we can do a little bit of shading with the color zones in mind, so for example, we can give a little bit more yellow Hue through the upper part of her head.	O
The knows we can go a little bit of pink.	O
Really useful the head color map, yeah, Pedro is really interesting and I've seen examples.	CHITCHAT
If you guys are curious to look into that more you can also find online you can find color Maps for things like the hands as well, and legs and all areas of the body have these different tendencies towards a slightly different hues.	O

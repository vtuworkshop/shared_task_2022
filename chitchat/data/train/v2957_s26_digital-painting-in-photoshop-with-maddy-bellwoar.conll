And the blue one is a little bit odd but.	O
Yeah, so here's a before and after before and after.	O
You can lower the opacity a little bit, but it just gives a little bit more life to the skin.	O
Your right hand cover so I used this.	O
It's to make my hand glide Morse movie on my tablet.	O
I'm using a Wakame Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
And it has a glass screen an I find that sometimes my hand will like kind of just get stuck a little bit on the glass.	CHITCHAT
If you wear a glove or something then you can draw very smoothly and it's more comfortable.	CHITCHAT
It also helps prevent smudges and things on the tablet, but really for me, it's more of a just ease of ease of painting.	CHITCHAT
The reason that I wear it.	CHITCHAT
Alright so let's start painting her hand.	O
Finally we will do this on a new layer.	O
Of course in case case.	CHITCHAT
You don't like how it looks.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to use this soft brush from earlier and.	O
Just start trying to block in the individual fingers a little bit more and I'll paint around the outside.	O
Of them, yeah, we just want to establish establish the shape of the fingers a little bit better.	O
So this one is a little tricky.	O
I'm going to keep them pretty light.	O
Until the next step.	O
So one thing that I found it really helpful with drawing fingers and hands of a specifically fingers is to think of them more as I used to think of fingers more rounded, but now I think of them more in as like.	O
Cubes are rectangles like for example.	O
Speaker brush that's less transparent this side of the finger.	O
Is separate from or has a sharp edge from this side?	O
It makes the fingers more easy to read if you can really separate the Top and the side of them so there's there's different ways to go about this.	O
But just even thinking of it.	CHITCHAT
That way when you're working can help I think.	CHITCHAT
The very tip, is going to be a little bit more rounded but.	O
The rest of the way down the fingers.	O
Is more of a solid shape?	O
So I'm going to go back to the lasso tool airbrush for this.	O
Let's make a new layer.	O
And grab the Airbrush got my lasso tool.	O
So I'm going to make a selection tracing around the shape of the finger going to start with the furthest one.	O
And get the whole finger.	O
An on a new layer.	O
The left side is a bit.	O
Darker and then towards the her finger her hand is as it's facing towards us.	O
The light as is hitting her cheek is also affecting your hand the same way so that bright light will also hit her finger.	O
So we get this kind of highlight so we get this side of the finger and Shadow and the side facing us in the light.	O
And if we deselect you have something like this now, it's going to look a little bit, silly at first until we go in and paint details.	O
It's going to look like plastic.	CHITCHAT
Hot dog fingers or something but it's OK.	CHITCHAT
We will we will make it better.	CHITCHAT
It's just a step one and I think it's a little easier to do it.	CHITCHAT
This way, so let's go to the next finger.	O
An I will just do the same thing again take the lasso tool and select all the way will select the knuckle at the end and select all the way around the finger.	O
And then Take a you can either do this on a separate layer from the first finger.	O
If you want or on the same layer kind of just depends on how confident you feel about this.	O

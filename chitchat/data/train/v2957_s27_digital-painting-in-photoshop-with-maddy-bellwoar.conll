And then choose what color you want for the shadow.	O
And just start painting that in and then as the.	O
As you go around to the side you can shift to the highlight.	O
So we can see where it's kind of hitting this knuckle here.	O
Bring it down like this.	O
Tee time enjoy your tea.	CHITCHAT
Here's I'll have a sip as well.	CHITCHAT
OK, so if I deselect then we have another finger and I will also.	O
Select this space in between the fingers here.	O
Put a shadow.	O
We can add a bit of red to it 'cause there's kind of a glow from the skin.	O
So of course again modify things if you can give me made the Anatomy, a little off, you can just change that, especially if they're on separate layers is pretty easy to modify.	O
OK let's go to the next one next finger.	O
Make a selection this one we don't really see the knuckle 'cause.	O
It's kind of tucking under the sweater.	O
I think my sweater needs to go up a little bit higher actually 'cause it's not going to cover that.	O
Alright we'll get to that next.	CHITCHAT
So we see the angle of the finger here.	O
And this one is all pretty light so.	O
We'll go from light to later this finger is getting really bright if you look at the photo.	O
The hand and the sweater are like the same bright NIS the finger.	O
Colour and her skin is reflecting.	O
Really really bright there so.	O
You can go really bright.	O
So I'm going to go to my lower layer with the sweater on it an make a selection.	O
Of a big piece big chunk of sweater and bring that layer on Top.	O
We're going to go to edit transform warp and just kind of pull it up like this.	O
Just drag it up like that, so now this is on Top of the layers with the.	O
On Top of the.	O
The fingers.	O
Let's try one more time it it transform warp.	O
Anne will decide how much I think I went a little overboard.	CHITCHAT
That's enough OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's go back to the fingers finger painting next one.	O
So we see a little bit of shadow in between them here.	O
So something like this and then the last little pinky finger.	O
Comes out and down.	O
We can be really casual with painting this now, especially because we have that piece of the sweater.	O
So I don't have to worry about that.	CHITCHAT
You have to worry about the edge, I can just kind of paint right through its covered so.	O
Pinky's a little odd.	O
But this is basically just a block in the basic.	O
Shading of the fingers.	O
Let's merge these.	O
So these are all the fingers on one layer.	O
We can make a layer underneath of that and do a little bit more shading under under the fingers.	O
For example, before we merge it down to the face.	O
It's more easy to paint underneath there right now, so.	O
Anywhere, where her fingers are close to her skin.	O
You might want to put in a little bit of extra.	O
Like sort of drop shadow or?	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
Nice Cup, Oh thank you my Penguin.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Well, I think I'm ready to merge down the hand.	O
If you think it's too bright or doesn't look natural.	O
You can lower the opacity a little bit, it kind of blends with what was already painted there emerged that down.	O
And then I'll also merge the sweater, so we're back to our two layers.	O
We're back to her and the background and our little sketch, which were not really using anymore.	O

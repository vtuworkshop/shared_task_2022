OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's go back to painting her face and her hand.	O
We can just kind of go back in and now like refine what we've done a little bit and add like for example, there should be some little wrinkles at the creases of these.	O
In these with these fingers.	O
Here.	O
You just Polish, it up.	O
Polish it up, we can add a little bit more shadow between these.	O
Knuckles and might even use the lasso tool here to block it off.	O
He's a smudge brush to clear that a little bit.	O
Got a little bit weird with that one finger now.	O
OK, I think I see the problem.	O
Let's choose a brush with some more a little bit more of a hard edge.	O
And we need to define this.	O
Sebastian says you prefer always to merge it has some advantage because I would have like a million layers.	CHITCHAT
But it makes my file very heavy.	CHITCHAT
I used to have that same thing Sebastian I used to save ice the kind of horrid layers a bit.	CHITCHAT
There are advantages and disadvantages to both merging layers.	O
Merging layers more often can help with what you're talking about your file will be less heavy.	O
It won't take up as much hard drive space and it's just easier to work with you don't have to deal with as much lag.	O
Potentially.	O
If you are experiencing that depending on what kind of processing power you have with your computer.	O
Uhm but for me if I'm talking about it nothing to do with technology and just to do with painting.	CHITCHAT
I like to merge more often because I find that it helps me commit and move on.	O
I used to have a very, very picky kind of slower way of painting and part of it was because of having all those layers.	CHITCHAT
I would really kind of overthink decisions before making them I would want to save layers to constantly be able to make changes to things and there are advantages to that, but within reason.	CHITCHAT
So for this painting, I think it's beneficial to me to have the character on a separate layer from the background.	O
It makes it easier to make changes to them.	O
Separately, an it's an advantage.	CHITCHAT
I think to keep them separate but beyond that.	CHITCHAT
I don't think it helps me to have like her hair on a different layer her hand on a different layer.	O
I only keep them on different layers when it's I think useful to me to have them that way, and then at that point I will.	O
I will just merge them when I feel like I like what I've done at that point.	O
I'll merge them and move on and sometimes it is.	O
Most of the time I think it's a good choice for me for my workflow every once in awhile I regret.	CHITCHAT
The merge and I'll be like, Oh I wish I had that separate that would have been more useful, but most of the time I don't mind if I need to separate something I'll just use the lasso tool select it and just like copy it.	O
You know layer new layer via copy or control J.	O
You can separate something on to another layer so usually that'll be good enough for me.	O
Mill says will you be illustrating the free part of the sweater or leaving that out?	CHITCHAT
Do you mean like the little strands and things?	CHITCHAT
Like if you look really close up.	CHITCHAT
There's Tiny Little.	CHITCHAT
Little strands like this, it depends I don't know to me.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of like a finishing effect.	CHITCHAT
So it just depends on how.	CHITCHAT
I don't consider that like a super high priority compared to other things that I want to work on in the painting that would be like if I had enough time.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I would add that in but that is not super super important to me because I'm not really going for like hyper realism.	CHITCHAT
With my art, I am happy if you get the effect.	CHITCHAT
From a distance like so from here, you really can see some of the fuzzy effects, but for the most part.	CHITCHAT
You know you're not really going to see it so much until you zoom in so for me.	CHITCHAT
If my painting reads well from like a full screen size that I'm happy.	CHITCHAT

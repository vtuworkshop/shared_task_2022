I'm probably not going to get into so, so many of the really minute.	CHITCHAT
Details just 'cause I doubt there will be time for it, but We'll see what happens.	CHITCHAT
Pedro said what really helped me about messy layers was to make whole pieces in one layer only just it was on an actual canvas also wait were you doing, traditional painting.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I've heard of a lot of artists doing like single layer painting challenges and things and I have done some of that in the past 2 with like quick studies nothing that I spent 2 too long on but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I have done some things like that, and I think it's a good way to learn.	CHITCHAT
A different workflow and maybe you like it, maybe you don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't think there's like a right or wrong way, necessarily for certain art styles.	CHITCHAT
It makes a lot of sense to keep things separate if you're doing something very clean and you have like a line art layer and then other clean layers.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be really silly to merge them.	CHITCHAT
Um let's see.	CHITCHAT
Breaking arts those along time ago, adopted minimal minimum layer mindset after watching one of your streams.	CHITCHAT
Now I work.	CHITCHAT
A lot faster and work with confidence.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I'm really glad to hear that it definitely helped me paint with more confidence.	CHITCHAT
See it's not some leaves into your fabric folds.	CHITCHAT
That's like the that's helping me get through it's helping me get through you know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Jackson says my take for now, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
That is amazing.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, Jackson.	CHITCHAT
I gotta say, though this is awesome, like OK.	CHITCHAT
This is a clever idea it looks good.	CHITCHAT
It looks really good, I especially like this texture in the background.	CHITCHAT
It kind of zig Zags in towards her and it kind of somehow echoes this.	CHITCHAT
Zigzag in the fan compositionally this is really pretty love that gold reflective texture, the sweater looks really nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is well done and being that this was not really a portrait study.	CHITCHAT
It was a study of.	CHITCHAT
Painting fabric folds.	CHITCHAT
I think you are in the clear to block the face-off if you choose.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's certainly a lot nicer looking than just leaving her face completely blank so that was a good compromise.	CHITCHAT
Very clever pro tips how to avoid painting their face.	CHITCHAT
Get really good at painting fans.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Nicely done.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, if any of you guys are watching and you'd like to join in with the painting like which accent said.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to join you also look like they just relax and hang out.	CHITCHAT
But it's always fun to see different artstyles attempting the.	CHITCHAT
The study reference.	CHITCHAT
A lot of different takes on.	CHITCHAT
On the theme.	CHITCHAT
OK, so yeah, let's keep going.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to just paint around the face and neck.	O
I haven't really done much with that, but we actually do see the sweater back here.	O
Some little details like that.	O
It doesn't need to be super super clean.	O
I'm OK with a little bit of a painterly effect.	O
Pokey says out of Big Fluff of her in front.	CHITCHAT
That's true Pokey Yeah, we can do suddenly it's very windy and there's like a rare swallowing like this Oh no.	CHITCHAT
There's there's a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I've just hairs a cover I would just be honest.	CHITCHAT
I've used her to couple cover up things I don't want to paint before for sure.	CHITCHAT
Usually, it has to do with the neck.	CHITCHAT
Anatomy and stuff like that, like just put a little hair there.	CHITCHAT
Right yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think every artist is guilty of that at some point.	CHITCHAT
The classic hands in the pockets and stuff.	CHITCHAT
You should see the other work in progress bar, Clovis started.	CHITCHAT
There's not going to be a lot of faces.	CHITCHAT
I don't blame you well.	CHITCHAT
The thing is, it's very distracting from the.	CHITCHAT

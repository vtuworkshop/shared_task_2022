From the fabric like.	CHITCHAT
It takes a lot of time to paint the face well and if you're trying to study something different.	CHITCHAT
Then you kind of way away that and see if it's really worth it.	CHITCHAT
She has a ponytail what about now.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Like you're putting that in your Commission rules, no ponytails.	CHITCHAT
No characters with ponytails no characters with hands.	CHITCHAT
OK, maybe we should paint this leaf up by her face because I'm just noticing.	O
I don't know what to do around this area, she's got a little leaf.	CHITCHAT
It's a decorative leaf.	CHITCHAT
It looks like it has glitter on it or something it's really pretty.	O
I'm curious if they made that it looks similar to the leaves that are.	CHITCHAT
From the plants behind her.	CHITCHAT
So I wonder if that was.	CHITCHAT
DIY project or something this is really cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright well, I'm just going to hand paint this little special, special tricks.	CHITCHAT
If you want you could.	O
Sketch it in first on a separate layer draw sketch and then paint it in.	O
Sometimes I'll do that.	CHITCHAT
Also, another tip, is sometimes for something like this, you can paint it if you're if you're just looking at the silhouette shape.	O
You can paint it in any color and then modify that color you can use.	O
You can use a?	CHITCHAT
Block transparency or clipping mask to paint within this so if you want you can just choose a color.	O
That's actually easy to see because the color of the leaf is like somewhat close door skin color so this is a little easier to see what you're doing, and then you can quickly change the color.	O
There's no reason, it needs to be painted in the color that's going to be.	O
So use my eraser to cut back in make some more interesting shape.	O
And it looks crazy, but I think when we shade, it in it will look like a leaf.	O
That's what we're hoping for.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So now we can lock the transparency press the little checkerboard icon up here and we can grab the airbrush or any brush and you can just fill in and only color so we're going to go for gold look.	O
For this leaf so.	O
When painting gold, it's important to note can look at the reference real quick goal when something looks gold.	O
There's usually a lot of different hues involved in that thing so see, there's like yellow gold.	O
There's like a bronzy orange.	O
Sometimes there's like green tones.	O
Gold objects usually have a lot of different little colors, reflecting its metallic it reflects the colors around.	O
It also and if you want it to look shiny, then we want to put some areas of high contrast, so really brighten really dark areas.	O
So, just picking ever just picking a color that looks gold is never going to quite do it.	O
We've got to think a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
So I think a little bit differently for that.	CHITCHAT
So I will start just shading in based on the reference where I see some different colours, so there's more Brown and.	O
This orangey red.	O
I'm going up through more yellow gold.	O
And at the end going a little bit more towards Green.	O
But it's generally going to be like in olive green.	O
The saturated kind of olive green that you see in gold jewelry and stuff, it's not usually like a bright green.	O
OK so that's layer one.	O
Let's Make a new layer and paint.	O
I'm going to get a different texture brush.	O
And colour pick from what we already have and let's go a little bit darker.	O
And I want to start drawing the center line of belief this little ornament, she's wearing it has.	O
You know the classic veins of the leaf kind of shape coming out like this.	O
Something like that, you can also do this on a multiply layer if you want a more intense effect that could be nice.	O

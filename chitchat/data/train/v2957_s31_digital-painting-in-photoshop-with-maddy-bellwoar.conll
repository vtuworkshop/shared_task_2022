I will create a clipping mask so that I don't have to worry about painting in the lines.	O
So that layer is attached onto the original.	O
Sheep.	CHITCHAT
Love how you splashed a few colors that it turned into a leave it really it really helps.	O
It looked so crazy before it had any shading on it.	CHITCHAT
Because I guess the colors in the shading help give the little bit more of the look of.	O
Foreshortening.	O
Alright I'm going to lower the opacity of that a little bit more 'cause I don't really like love love it.	O
But it's a start.	O
Make a new layer and do the same thing again.	O
Sometimes these things just take a few.	CHITCHAT
Whew.	CHITCHAT
Steps.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to start adding in some of the highlights, though we want to start bringing in some of those bright.	O
Bright reflections.	O
So it's a little bit glittery.	O
We've got some little glitters Here in there, so I'm just going to.	O
Popping these little sequin effects.	O
And over here.	O
So again for something to look shiny.	O
We need to go high contrast, so that means not just these bright lights, but also.	O
Some.	CHITCHAT
Some darker.	CHITCHAT
Darker little flex also.	O
So I am again, I'm using layers here.	O
This is on a separate layer.	O
It looks very because I've detailed this a lot more than anything around it.	O
It's really stealing our attention away from her face because it's so detailed and crisp with all these hard edges and like noisy, so as soon as we're done with this.	O
Leaf we're going to go back and work on her face more and detail that gives some little shines.	O
Actually, we could probably just go ahead and do that now and come back to the leaf for more leader.	O
Yeah, OK, so we've got that I've got the leaf.	O
For now.	O
And the good thing about this is now we can have her hair tucked nicely behind there and I think it's going to look a lot better now, it gives me some idea what I'm doing with the hair, so for example, let's go back to the brush.	O
I was using now we can have.	O
You know this kind of.	O
Affect that it's a little bit of like a pin.	O
A hairpin or something.	O
Wet brush it used for the shiny things I used the rectangle texture brush at a very small size, so I was just basically making little square.	O
Those square dots with it.	O
You guys can find my brushes below the stream in the description panel or above the chat in the info tab.	O
There should be links to my brushes in both places.	CHITCHAT
The brush I was just using their is just part of my basic.	O
Brush pack that's free to download if you want to check it out.	O
Alright I will leave the leaf on its own layer.	O
Still, because I might want to do some shading under it, or move it around so I'm not ready to we're not ready to commit to the leaf yet but.	O
Let's keep going and keep painting her face so it's time to put some.	CHITCHAT
For some sharp details here so we're going to, I'm using the wet paint brush.	O
It looks like this.	CHITCHAT
It's a cool brush, but it took me awhile to get used to working with it because you kind of if you paint like this, or like this do you see how the darker side of the brush will be at the Top or bottom so it's really nice for doing a little bit of shading like for example, if I want.	O
The underneath of the main part of the brush to have like a little bit of a shadow.	O
It kind of automatically does that, but you have to make the brush stroke in a certain direction.	O

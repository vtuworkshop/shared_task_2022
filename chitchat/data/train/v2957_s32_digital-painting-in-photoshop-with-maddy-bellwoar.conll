Otherwise, it's going to be opposite.	O
So, sometimes I have a little.	O
The controls the a couple times, so I figure out what I'm doing but I like this brush a lot.	O
For that effect, I think it's really nice.	O
And it looks very to me, it looks.	O
Like.	O
Real paint paint strokes.	O
The leaf looks magical thanks I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
I I like to generally stay pretty soft with eyebrows and things but we'll see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Give a little bit more.	O
Crisp detail to the eyelid.	O
And the lower one and sometimes I will also.	O
Paint in like a little bit of pink in the eyelid like a color pic from her lips.	O
'cause there's going to be subtle amount and let's go darker.	O
See the corner of the eye where you have, like tear duct.	O
Sometimes you'll see a little bit of pink there so sometimes I paint that in it kind of depends.	O
Have you painted your pic Oh like a self portrait?	CHITCHAT
Um not anytime recently I mean, I've done some self portraits like in my life.	CHITCHAT
But it's been a long time.	CHITCHAT
So I don't have any.	CHITCHAT
Any recent ones to show you.	CHITCHAT
So this is such a dark line that I'm painting on Top.	O
It's like really changing her face.	O
You can lower the opacity a little bit if it's too much and you don't want to cover up so much what you've done before.	O
So I'm using color that's not quite pure black, but it's pretty desaturated.	O
But for the lips, I might want to choose something a little bit more like a dark warm red because even in the shadows.	O
We still often have a little bit of saturation to the color.	O
I do have fun painting portraits.	CHITCHAT
Once I get into it.	CHITCHAT
I find the early stages kind of rough, you know.	CHITCHAT
I want to get into it.	CHITCHAT
It's fun fun to get in here and paint little details and things.	CHITCHAT
So her eyes are Brown my version of her eyes are very Gray, so far.	O
I'd like to give them a bit more warmth in.	O
Saturation like depth, so it's coming here with some deeper Brown.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Darker up.	O
And the Top under the eyelid.	O
Again, I'm painting a little bit more in like a semi realistic kind of.	CHITCHAT
Style I'm not trying to go for a very, very realistic painting style.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit of- from that proportions wise, but I just kind of enjoy enjoy painting this style.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of like a little bit of an idealized realism innocence.	CHITCHAT
That a lot of times semi realistic style will have.	CHITCHAT
Some details left out just kind of smooth things over a bit.	CHITCHAT
So we don't get super super into each skin pore or like tiny little hairs and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I will include some, but it kind of just depends on.	CHITCHAT
What I think is adding to the picture and what I think looks nice.	CHITCHAT
And if I think it's distracting or it takes away something that I won't do it.	CHITCHAT
Let me give a little bit more.	O
Turn to the corner of her mouth.	O
Can I share my tree painting process?	CHITCHAT
Of course I would love to see it?	CHITCHAT
So you can post it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
So I want to actually paint her teeth.	O

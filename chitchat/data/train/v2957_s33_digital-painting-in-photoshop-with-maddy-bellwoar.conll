Always, a scary idea every time came from pizza can end up looking very creepy.	CHITCHAT
But we're not going to get Super Crisp or super detailed with it.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to paint.	CHITCHAT
I colored pick from her eyes to get a little bit of that kind of off white color.	O
It's actually pretty dark.	O
Look how dark the color is this is what I'm painting her teeth right now, but it's just all relative colors.	O
All relative so compared to the colors around it.	O
It kind of looks white or like a possible color of teeth.	O
Let's see your scared why let me see.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, what are you scared of?	CHITCHAT
What are you scared of this is under his painting?	CHITCHAT
That she's working on and there is nothing to be scared of look at these beautiful details and the colours.	CHITCHAT
You chose for the more cool like blue greens in the shadows and then the warmer yellow greens and the sun.	CHITCHAT
It looks really good, he putting a lot of time in detail into this.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, nothing to be scared about.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, look at that look at that I really like the depth that you kept these silhouettes.	CHITCHAT
Like edit distance so you can really feel like these plants are kind of closer to the viewer.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's looking really good don't you worry thing.	CHITCHAT
It's looking really good.	CHITCHAT
I'm very happy with it anyway.	CHITCHAT
Can add a little bit more saturation to the lips?	O
And I might change her.	O
What's the word expression alittle bit.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I like to draw people that are smiling have a little happy smile or smirk.	CHITCHAT
I mean, you can always draw the kind of.	CHITCHAT
You know serious model pose and expression and everything.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I just think it's a little bit more uplifting to look at.	CHITCHAT
Like to draw a little smile.	CHITCHAT
I should really practice.	CHITCHAT
Some other types of expressions.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that something will study together someday guys.	CHITCHAT
Different facial expressions like more extreme ones.	CHITCHAT
I think that would be something good to do.	CHITCHAT
I'm just noticing now that I should actually if I want her to look at us and not that she's looking far to the side.	O
I need to move her.	O
I a little bit from where I placed it.	O
You actually can see if you look at the reference.	O
It's possible to see a little bit of the white of her eyes.	O
On the Corner in the corner.	O
Face expressions I run.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
I know it's it's not really it's not really my.	CHITCHAT
My comfort either I have, like a few types of expressions that I generally like to paint and that's mostly because the type of paintings.	CHITCHAT
I like to do are generally.	CHITCHAT
Just being just being honest, I like to paint fantasy scenes.	CHITCHAT
I like to paint if I do paint characters.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like to paint.	CHITCHAT
Like a peaceful scenes like elves or fairies or something magical and just relaxing kind of scenes and I don't usually paint a lot of dramatic expressions or Super.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I I go with fairly peaceful happy kinds of environment in my paintings, so most of the time I don't really need to.	CHITCHAT
Paint crazy expressions, however, I feel like it's also just a good thing to have make your skills a little bit more well rounded.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, OK, I had to move her.	O
I ended up repainting a lot of it, but it's OK, I could have.	CHITCHAT
Notice that earlier, but now she's looking at us.	CHITCHAT
Poker face is my favorite.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, well OK, I will just be honest.	CHITCHAT
I think it's really important when you're 1st starting painting portraits to stick with basic facial expressions.	O
Maybe some people would disagree with me, but I feel like it's good to work first at just trying to get the proportions right and put the right.	O

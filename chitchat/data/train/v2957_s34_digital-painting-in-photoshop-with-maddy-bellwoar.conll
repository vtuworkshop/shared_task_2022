The anatomy in the right place and not try to do any crazy expressions right off the bat so for me.	CHITCHAT
I was still for awhile.	CHITCHAT
I was just kind of like working on my basic basic anatomy.	CHITCHAT
I think maybe it can be.	CHITCHAT
Now that could be something to do soon some different expressions.	CHITCHAT
But I don't think that's something that you need to run into if you're 1st starting to paint people.	CHITCHAT
I think maybe it's good to hold off on the crazy expressions of 1st.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to, I painted the eye on a separate layer and I'm going to erase out a little bit of what I did on the eyelids around the eye and leave just what I modified in the center with the move of the people in iris because I kind of liked my original eyelid painting, but I want I still want to move by over so.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's continue.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
We repainted the whole I OK, so let's let's start with some finishing things on the ice machine touches.	O
So just go to the iris over here get that.	O
In the right spots and.	O
We can add some.	O
The leaf is going to.	O
The leaf is taking the painting through another level, yeah, we have to match the leaf now.	O
I'm just kidding.	CHITCHAT
We don't have to make everything quite that detailed.	O
Once once we decide on.	O
Finishing details for the face.	O
Go and paint the face and the leaf, a little bit more to match each other better.	O
But I was planning on doing more details of the face.	CHITCHAT
Anyway.	CHITCHAT
But it's surprising how much a little bit of shining texture can make a big difference, so for example, when we add that the lights to the eyes.	O
That's going to make a big, big change before we get to that.	O
I want to add a little bit more saturation.	O
There's some shadows that I have around her eye on this side for example, and it just looks really almost like I don't know almost dirty.	O
I don't like it when.	CHITCHAT
Shadows look like that I feel like that.	CHITCHAT
Probably I've done something wrong value.	O
Wise, like the shading darks to lights and I can try to add a little bit of saturation, but that's only going to fix so much.	O
Let's make a new layer and figure out what I've done.	O
That makes this look dirty over here.	O
Zoom out zoom out.	O
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Gotta zoom out, I'm.	O
Going to make some bad choices if we don't look at this from more of a distance.	O
Better.	CHITCHAT
We can have a little bit more shadow coming from the.	O
Hi Bro, Down here 'cause we got a little bit of an angle view.	O
And she has some little shine on the eyelid here.	O
Make up.	O
I think it's better.	CHITCHAT
OK finally let's add.	O
Some highlights so I'm going to start with the Airbrush and just choose.	O
Hey white closer to white color and maybe a little bit cooler.	O
For the the I were going to get a little bit more roundness to the eyeball by putting.	O
Brighter area.	O
Closer to the The iris.	O

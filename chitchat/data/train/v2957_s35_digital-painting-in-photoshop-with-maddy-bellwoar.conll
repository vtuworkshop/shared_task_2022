Is it possible to see the values after you finish working on yes?	O
Also, they will change a little bit more as I'm about to put like some final highlights and shiny things.	O
But if we turn the painting into black-and-white this is what it looks like.	O
And I can also see the.	CHITCHAT
With the reference looks like here.	CHITCHAT
So there's quite a big difference.	O
But I think value wise the difference isn't too bad.	O
I can definitely be brighter in the face and we're lacking some like noise detail.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
To study and do you feel like?	CHITCHAT
I'm learning something.	CHITCHAT
Not really.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's nice to hear Andre I think that's a good sign.	CHITCHAT
I think that's a good sign.	CHITCHAT
I don't need to make a new layer every time I'm being making too many layers OK.	O
Let's paint.	O
The shines in the eyes.	O
Finally we waited so long for this moment.	CHITCHAT
Alright Here we go?	CHITCHAT
I'm using the brush in my brush pack called wet paint.	O
I like this one for making these little shines.	O
There's I'm just going from the reference.	O
There's the shines in the eyes are broken up into a bunch of little dots, sometimes you get like one big dot.	O
There's also little shining down here.	O
This makes the eyes look really glacis.	O
So it's up to you like how many you want to put in.	O
How intense you want to go with that?	O
I'm also going to add some eyelashes now.	O
I try to stay away from adding a ton of individual eyelashes.	O
A good tip, I learned is try to paint the eyelashes as if they're wet like if you ever seen someone get out of a pool or shower or your own eyelashes for example.	O
How they'll stick together and kind of clump up like this?	O
That's a good way to paint eyelashes.	O
Sometimes it looks a little bit more.	O
A natural when you kind of like space them evenly and or or have a whole lot of them it feels.	O
Feels.	CHITCHAT
A little bit better to kind of clump them together, most of the time from a distance.	O
Also, you're only going to really see it kind of like that, you're not going to see so many individual eyelashes.	O
From a distance so.	O
Something think about trying to give him a nice curve.	O
And the bottom eyelashes can show a lot about the angle.	O
The angle that they're coming out of the eye.	O
This will not die.	CHITCHAT
But you know the eyelid, yeah, so it'll give a lot of information about the direction so it can really help make the eyelid look more rounded if you turn the eyelashes.	O
As you go around see what I mean, like turning the direction of them.	O
I usually like to only put the eyelashes kind of around the edge.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Think about this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to keep going with some more details, finishing up the face so for example, the corners of the mouth.	O
Anywhere that we just want a little bit more detail and sharpness.	O
We can just kind of go over with a hard edge brush and.	O
Paint that in.	O
I don't think I will paint like a space between the teeth or anything like that.	O
I think it works well enough to just show the color of the teeth back there, if you start painting, too many individual teeth that kind of can look creepy but.	O
Haley art welcome good morning.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
I think I will add a little bit of detail to the eyebrows.	O

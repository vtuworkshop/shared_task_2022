Just a little bit one thing that's fun is you can color pic from the skin.	O
An kind of pull that color in towards the eyebrow versus just you know the opposite and bringing eyebrows outside of the eyebrow shape.	O
You can also sort of cut in like that to put a little bit of space.	O
It's all very in fashion now to have a little bit of bigger eyebrows and more natural eyebrows.	CHITCHAT
It seems so we can give her.	O
Some.	CHITCHAT
Some more detail there.	O
Hey Karen, how are you welcome?	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you could make it.	CHITCHAT
We're doing some sort of polishing effects on.	CHITCHAT
Portrait here.	CHITCHAT
Ah Tanager birds.	CHITCHAT
I'm honored.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for coming over here to catch the stream.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're doing well today.	CHITCHAT
Let me zoom out.	CHITCHAT
Let me zoom out.	O
Here's our painting, so far.	O
You can see the reference here it doesn't look exactly like her, but	O
My goal was just to do a good job with the portrait just to make a nice portrait.	O
Semi realistic.	O
Sort of style and.	CHITCHAT
And to practice on the.	O
Folds fabric folds, and things now the sweater that I've painted it doesn't necessarily look like the exact same type of fabric as what she's wearing in the reference but.	O
Up.	CHITCHAT
As long as the folds are good then I'll be happy.	O
We're going to do a little bit more on this and I'm just looking at her face.	CHITCHAT
I think I need to.	CHITCHAT
Do something with this guy over here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to copy it onto a new layer and maybe I need to move it over or make it bigger or both.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Seems like her eyes like I painted her eyes like farther apart in my painting than they are in real life.	O
And that's bothering.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a little bit better.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I'm just modifying some of the facial features.	O
I painted too, hopefully being a better proportion.	CHITCHAT
The bit maybe a bit late for that, but let's just keep going well will zoom out for awhile and paint.	O
From here, so I'd like to get more of a consistent feeling of on the whole painting.	CHITCHAT
I feel I don't know if you guys know what I'm talking about, but when I zoom in for awhile.	CHITCHAT
And then I zoom out sometimes I feel like I just don't have a consistent painting throughout the whole scene.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's like I just want to want to work around and get the same detail level everywhere and the the area.	CHITCHAT
I was just working on when I was zoomed in looks good.	CHITCHAT
But we need to work on some other areas and get things just working happily together again.	CHITCHAT
Ah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Karen it's going good.	CHITCHAT
It's going good.	CHITCHAT
It's been good painting day so far.	CHITCHAT
No complaints.	CHITCHAT
What program do you use to keep the reference photo always visible it is called pure ref?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to type it in the chat just in case that helps because you might want to look I might want to Google, it.	CHITCHAT
But it's pure raff it's Super Handy.	CHITCHAT
You can.	CHITCHAT
Use it for reference boards and mood boards and things but mostly what I use it.	CHITCHAT
For is just what you see here holding the reference up there, especially when I'm when I'm streaming.	CHITCHAT

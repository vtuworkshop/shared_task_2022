I'm going to make a new layer and put it on multiply mode.	O
I'm going to clip that on to my layer of the person and that way I can do some shading an?	O
I don't like that color.	O
But I think it does need to be darker.	O
We paint more after this, I'm going to work on this painting for a little while longer.	CHITCHAT
But I'm probably not going to start a new painting today.	CHITCHAT
I just want to be able to Polish this one a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
That's true from general to particular otherwise you lose the focus.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I feel like that's what happened a little bit here so.	CHITCHAT
Let's zoom out an let's paint from this distance also I'm going to try to flip this OK, there, we go.	O
Going to do some painting from this distance.	CHITCHAT
So I just want to put a little bit of shadow underneath her hair and underneath her arm and just.	O
Just in a couple of places.	O
That I think could use a little bit more depth.	O
I don't want to go too far with this so I have it on a separate layer.	O
An I can turn the layer on and off or lower the Opacity.	O
So I think that's what I'll do is just lower it to about 36% or something.	O
OK, so now we can go back into painting so I'm going to grab a harder edged brush and just continue on with what we were doing way back when we were painting the?	O
The sweater so I'm just going to go back to that hand painting, some of the textures and even though it feels.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
A little bit difficult to be so zoomed out and an painting something detail like this.	O
I think it's important to stay zoomed out while I paint the sweater details, especially near the edges of the canvas.	O
We don't want to get too.	O
Crisp here so I'm just going to paint it from this.	O
Distance.	O
How much longer is the stream I'm not surely art to be honest?	CHITCHAT
I am having a hard time estimating?	CHITCHAT
How long this is going to take.	CHITCHAT
I don't do a lot of.	CHITCHAT
This paper.	CHITCHAT
Portraits exactly so I'm not 100% sure, but I would suspect.	CHITCHAT
Another.	CHITCHAT
Half an hour to hour maybe.	CHITCHAT
Probably half an hour is a bit of a short estimate based on what I have to do next, but it will depend how smoothly things go it.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to keep painting and take my time and I don't have an exact plan, but it seems like it's almost done.	CHITCHAT
But I also know myself and we might run up to we might come up with some other.	CHITCHAT
Things we want to do and take a lot longer.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I don't I don't know some days when we do landscapes for example, I have alot.	CHITCHAT
Better of an idea.	CHITCHAT
Ahead of time.	CHITCHAT
Hey, how are you keep going OK we're going to keep going for a bit longer anyway.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we have some horizontal stripes on the right side or horizontal stripes on the left vertical stripes on the right the pattern on her sweater.	O
So I'm just following that.	O
The sweater looks shiny, I know it really does it reminds me of like?	CHITCHAT
I don't know something, you to wear on like.	CHITCHAT
And New Years or something I mean, if you were going to, if you were going to wear sweater like this, you don't want to get a nice shiny one like this.	CHITCHAT
Because of these little marks they look kind of like sequins, but	CHITCHAT
It was sort of a happy accident.	CHITCHAT
It just kind of started turning out this way, and I liked it so I figured why not?	CHITCHAT
There's no rules it has to be.	CHITCHAT

Brush Paxson.	CHITCHAT
All kinds of things.	CHITCHAT
And I like to add to that list.	CHITCHAT
Still, now because I'm always.	CHITCHAT
I still like I like to watch tons of tutorials and process videos and streams and things also.	CHITCHAT
Really, Oh that's cool that's cool.	CHITCHAT
I didn't hear about that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, their books are really nice.	CHITCHAT
Alright I'm going to add a little bit more.	O
Highlights here.	O
I can't leave this one area just kind of untouched because the Airbrush is super smooth and it it's very.	O
Obvious think.	O
Leave an area totally smooth.	O
OK, so one thing that I want to do now is.	CHITCHAT
I've worked on her for a while we worked on the background before and now I kind of want to look at getting her in the background.	O
More cohesive.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
For example, What I mean by that is a little combination of things it has to do with color has to do with value like I still feel like she just looks like she's standing in front of this background and there's a reason.	O
Part of it has to do with the lack of detail the background is still looking much more blurry we can add more detail there.	O
And another thing has to do with color so will address the colors 1st.	O
Hi a sling more welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
We're working on a portrait.	CHITCHAT
So what I would like to do now is to make a new layer an adjustment layer so I have my layers palette here.	O
I'm going to go down to this half circle icon and select.	O
Let's let's use color balance and.	O
I will create a clipping mask of the color balance balance layer onto the character so that it's only affecting her so any changes.	O
They make are not going to have anything to do with the background.	O
And then I'm going to go through The Shadows Midtones and highlights and just kind of.	O
Shift the Shift these a little bit.	O
Until I feel like she.	O
Belongs in the scene, a little bit more so my prediction was that I was going to want to shift her a little bit Hue shift her a little bit more towards a green because I feel like the background has a lot of Green.	O
There's a lot of green maybe a lot of green bounce light so that actually feels better already.	O
Let's see the before and after.	O
Before after.	CHITCHAT
OK, it's like barely noticeable.	O
Maybe it's in my head let's look at the mid tones.	O
And highlights.	O
Going to go a little bit more like cyan.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit different may have been not much of a change.	O
We can also look at the levels.	O
So I think we need to add more contrast darken.	O
The shadows little bit again.	O
I want this to be clipped on here, so that it's not changing the background.	O
See that it's a big difference.	O
She was looking kind of washed out compared to the background.	O
And if anything, we want the obvious that the opposite would want the background to be like later in less contrast, and her so that she stands out so.	O
Yeah, she is a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Little bit more contrast now.	O
So for and after.	O
Looking a little dark.	O
2.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I like this.	CHITCHAT
I think I like this change.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to go with it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Now, technically didn't have to use adjustment layers for those since I was just going to merge them all but I wanted to be able to turn the visibility on and off and check everything together before committing to it so.	O

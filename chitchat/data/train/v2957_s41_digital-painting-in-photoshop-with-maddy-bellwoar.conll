OK.	CHITCHAT
Also I'm going to look at the little hair ornament and I think I will desaturate it a little bit.	O
It's just really, really drawing my attention with how yellow it was so we're going to turn that down a little bit.	O
And I'm going to merge it down onto her face.	O
Actually, the immediate regret before I merge it hold on.	CHITCHAT
Let's zoom in this event, There's one thing I should do OK.	O
Before we merge it down this will be very quick.	O
I just going to take the Airbrush and give a little bit of shading underneath 'cause like that's going to make it really look like it's sitting against her skin.	O
Without that, it looks like it's kind of floating there, so there, we go now we can merge it down.	O
So one extra step.	O
OK, so let's save.	O
Write another like checkpoint, OK, so right now.	O
If I was going to merge her with the background.	CHITCHAT
This would be the time when I would consider doing it, but I don't know that I want to do that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know that it's needed, for her to be merged to the background.	CHITCHAT
But I'm going to make a new layer an start painting the.	O
Some more of the leaves.	O
Let me show you guys, the reference up close.	O
So there are you can see this blur effect on the right 'cause.	O
This wall is further away from us, but on the left.	O
These leaves are like pretty in focus.	O
They're closer to her face on the Camera you know focused in there so.	O
One thing that we could do is.	CHITCHAT
Drossart paint some of those leaves a little bit more precisely also I think I can crop in like her compared to the background.	O
I have like way more background going on in my image.	O
I think than the original and I certainly don't feel the need to paint that much more background so let's.	O
Let's zoom in a little bit.	O
And these catch up the little shadow, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it makes it's nice because it does make a difference.	CHITCHAT
And if I try to do it later it would be a bit.	CHITCHAT
Well, it would be a lot more work as I'd have to go all carefully around the leaf so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm glad I realized it before I had to go back in.	CHITCHAT
Paint it later.	CHITCHAT
OK, yeah, that crop is way better.	O
I didn't realize how much that extra background was distracting me OK.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
So now we can take I mean, I I'm not sure how much if it really matters.	CHITCHAT
What brush we're using here, but a brush with hard edge and.	O
We can start painting some individual leave shapes.	O
Hi corban, beautiful work I'd like to know what is the shortcut to flip the image.	O
Thank you first of all and let me show you where that is I messed up explaining this earlier so let me.	CHITCHAT
And they were properly now you go to edit.	CHITCHAT
Keyboard shortcuts.	O
And then application menus.	O
And then you can go to image.	O
Philip canvas horizontal and you need to type in here, something that you would like to be your shortcut because it will not.	O
It's not a default shortcut.	O
So you have to go through those steps to set it up, but it's not it's not too difficult to just go to edit keyboard shortcuts and then shortcuts for application menus.	O
And then scroll all the way down to image and then go flip canvas horizontal control F.	O
And then we should be good to go.	CHITCHAT
I put control F because it's easy to remember like F for flip but you can put anything of course.	O
I am drawing and painting on a have a welcome centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
So I'm using the stylus painting on the screen, and then my left hand.	CHITCHAT
I'm using all the keyboard shortcuts, so I find it easier to pick.	CHITCHAT
Shortcuts that are I can hit with the left hand on the left side of the keyboard.	CHITCHAT
Otherwise, you know it's just very inconvenient.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you're welcome, no worries.	CHITCHAT
I use that one all the time of course, you can just go to also go to edit or image, adjust flip horizontal wait am I telling the wrong thing image image rotation flip horizontal, yeah, so this one.	O

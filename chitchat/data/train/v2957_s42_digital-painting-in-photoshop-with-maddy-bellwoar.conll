You can do you can always just go to the menus like this and if you only flip every once in awhile then?	O
That's fine, but If you want to do it, I'll do a lot of flipping then.	O
You can set it as a shortcut.	O
So I'm just going to these very, very kind of messy and vague believe shapes that I have an starting to hopefully make them look more like individual leaves so I'm just putting some hard edges in and maybe we can even draw in some little.	O
Veins in the leaves something like this.	O
So they're kind of like coming out of abstraction a little bit.	O
And you can paint via like regular painting like just paint.	O
The leaf or you can sort of do some negative space painting where you choose.	O
The background color and use that to paint.	O
In around green shapes and define the Leafs more see that also can work with different ways of doing this.	O
Pending on what works for you.	O
Or a little bit of both.	O
I think a little bit of both is a natural more of a natural look.	O
I think it's a little bit tricky to find that perfect.	O
Like fade from.	O
From in focus to the blur effect that we use for the background.	O
So I think sometimes you have to go ahead and pay over that a bit.	O
So you get a little bit more subtle transition.	O
We use like a Gaussian blur at the beginning.	O
To make the background a little bit more.	O
Blurred out.	O
So I'm painting on a layer above her right now, so I'm actually able to paint over the edge of I can paint over her and stuff.	O
I don't know if I want to do that.	CHITCHAT
It's possible.	CHITCHAT
Well, I hope you guys are having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for hanging out with me.	CHITCHAT
We're not quite done, but we're getting closer.	CHITCHAT
If you guys have any questions or anything, let me know.	CHITCHAT
Definitely want to get a chance to put some more finishing touches on this at the end and so I would consider finishing touches to be like any little areas that have little shine or little rim light or something.	O
There's not too much of that, like rim late.	O
There's not too much of that kind of lighting, but I might like to do some little flyaway hairs just last little things like that.	O
Also, a nice thing to keep note of is.	CHITCHAT
Around the edges of the canvas, especially you know the corners lower areas anything away from the focal point.	O
It's sometimes it's nice to get rid of any like super distracting things there so if there's any really break if we painted anything really bright.	O
Or.	O
Very eye catching.	O
It might be nice to tone that down a little bit.	O
If anybody is just getting here now or recently if you'd like to see this painting from the beginning.	CHITCHAT
We started it from blank canvas at the beginning of stream so you're welcome to check out the replay of this, if you ever want to.	CHITCHAT
It's if you go to my page here on be hands.	CHITCHAT
There's a tab that says videos and any of the past streams are there so you could watch any of them if you're interested in this one will be there after a little bit of processing.	CHITCHAT
Time post stream and then you'll be able to find it later.	CHITCHAT
All right, so if I turn this layer on a Nov.	O
I'm definitely liking.	CHITCHAT
This a lot better with the extra background.	O
Details it stoning the background down a bit.	O
It's darkening it a bit an I feel like it has more dimension.	O
I like these leaves closer to her face being more detail than I want to add more of those.	O
Hi Eric all thank you.	CHITCHAT

We had a very cool, one earlier from Jackson.	CHITCHAT
We do another painting, I don't know how long you've been live already today.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately, I won't be doing another painting, I've been streaming for about 3, 1/2 hours and I will be working on this one.	CHITCHAT
A little bit more.	CHITCHAT
But I probably won't be starting a new painting.	CHITCHAT
Today.	CHITCHAT
But sometimes we do, sometimes we do more than one painting in a stream in that case.	CHITCHAT
I generally will kind of budget out a little bit less time for each one.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to paint around her head a little bit of lighter colors for the leaves when we started this there was a lot of the black shadow around their head.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is an art club study.	CHITCHAT
Every 2 weeks my discord community is doing a sort of group study were studying different subjects.	CHITCHAT
This time around, we were working on.	CHITCHAT
Up.	CHITCHAT
Fabric folds and wrinkles and things like that, although let's be honest.	CHITCHAT
I spent a lot of time working on other things in the painting, too, but.	CHITCHAT
The main reason we chose this image was for the fabric texture.	CHITCHAT
Things.	CHITCHAT
But anybody is welcome to join in with that, if you're interested I can put a link to my discord.	CHITCHAT

My information area.	CHITCHAT
Buy a pro designer thanks for hanging out with us.	CHITCHAT
Have a good day.	CHITCHAT
Alright I want to zoom in and do a little bit more of these.	O
These leaves closer to her and maybe we can even detail one of the Brown ones more.	O
I mean, just because they're kind of dry doesn't mean they don't have any detail.	O
We can give a little detail.	O
Seems like the adding a little bit of the veins in the leave goes along way.	O
A little bit of like glimmer.	O
You can even sketch some of that in up here.	O
In these.	O
I think that's an OK transition.	O
OK, yeah, I think I like that, so were to make a new layer on Top of this and I'm just going to work on edges between her and the background.	O

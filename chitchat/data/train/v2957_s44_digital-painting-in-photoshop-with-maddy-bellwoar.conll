So.	CHITCHAT
An final little finishing things so this is something Mills asked about earlier.	CHITCHAT
Um was about these little kind of flyaway fuzzy things in the sweater.	CHITCHAT
There's like these little tiny fuzzy's and the.	CHITCHAT
The sweater texture that I ended up going with is a bit different.	CHITCHAT
So I don't know if the fuzzies really make sense for me to add but I've certainly seen fuzzy sweaters with sequins on at the same time, so I think it is possible so I can try it, I can try adding the fuzzy texture to the edges and see if it if it works, or if it feels weird then.	CHITCHAT
We'll take it of.- But it's basically just these little tiny, squiggly hairs that are catching some light and it's really apparent more in the high contrast areas like where the sweaters overlapping the background.	CHITCHAT
Then you'll see you'll probably see it.	CHITCHAT
What do you guys think about it just like a first impression?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to keep going a little bit more 'cause sometimes.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to make a judgment on a small area.	CHITCHAT
I think I like it, but I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
You guys can let me know if you have a strong opinion on this sweater fuzzies.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing it on a separate layer so we can always bail.	CHITCHAT
Can you illustrate an image that does not belong to you and is not hosted on a free site like unsplash?	CHITCHAT
Well, it's a bit of a complicated issue and I feel like I don't feel really authorized to answer without being a lawyer because it's a bit complicated.	CHITCHAT
Technically, you just have to be really careful doing that people have different art styles and sometimes someone references an image but there painting becomes so different from the original that you sometimes can't even tell what they were originally basing it off of and in that case.	CHITCHAT
Then it's less of a problem, but if you're going to recreate something and paint.	CHITCHAT
It very realistically very, very much like the original than that can be.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that could be potentially a problem.	CHITCHAT
If you're going to try to sell something with your sort of copy.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean, if you're just doing it for like practice and stuff like that, then that's generally not an issue.	CHITCHAT
It's nice to give credit to the original person that you were the photographer what not but.	CHITCHAT
It's more of an issue when you're selling things.	CHITCHAT
It does fit OK, so you're OK with the fuzzies I kinda like them.	CHITCHAT
I kinda like them.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to keep doing it.	CHITCHAT
But I like to use Pexels Unsplash Pixabay.	CHITCHAT
There are just so many good royalty, free image sites out there.	CHITCHAT
Nowadays, I mean, it's it's.	CHITCHAT
You don't really need to.	CHITCHAT
Go into a risky area you know.	CHITCHAT
Because there's so much out there.	CHITCHAT
There's really, really a lot of content you can use that's safe so.	CHITCHAT
I would I would try to stick with that, if you can just have a?	CHITCHAT
Less headache.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Karen thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, yeah, tanager.	CHITCHAT
Exactly exactly it just gets a little more complicated.	CHITCHAT
Love the texture yay OK.	CHITCHAT
Thank you I'm glad.	CHITCHAT
Also wondering if it was a little too much.	CHITCHAT
Glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
So I'm not going to put the texture everywhere.	CHITCHAT

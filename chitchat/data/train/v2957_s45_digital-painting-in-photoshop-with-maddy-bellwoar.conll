But just more in the focal areas and let's work, a little bit more on the hair.	O
I will probably leave the hair fairly smooth just because I think.	O
I think it looks nice.	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty happy with how the hair looks anyway.	CHITCHAT
But we can add a little bit more highlights or just a little bit more.	O
You know, some little more individual strands.	O
Sometimes it's nice to like purposely add Little Flyaways and things that kind of go away from the overall.	O
Motion of the hair might seem counter intuitive but it can make the hair look.	O
A lot more natural if you have some random little flyaways and things rather than all the hairs perfectly going in the same direction because as much as we would like that to be the case.	O
It's usually not happening that way usually there's random hairs flying around.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I like this area of the hair how kind of curls under.	O
It's got a little bit less one color.	O
Kind of curls and tucks under itself a little bit there.	O
You can also use a darker strands.	O
The background here is a little bit lighter, so we can take some of the darker strands and bring that front of the background.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Perfect down here, the background little darker, so we can bring some of this lighter strands in front.	O
The darker background.	O
And that's how you can get some more like look of like loose hairs and things.	O
We take a pain like that, it can only do architectural drawings well.	CHITCHAT
First of all thank you for the compliment, Getty on, but I don't think I would say you only do architectural drawings that's a?	CHITCHAT
There's something quite complicated to do.	CHITCHAT
I think that's pretty impressive.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I bet with the skills that you have doing architectural drawings.	CHITCHAT
That's probably a really, really good starting point for drawing and painting any subject if you have.	CHITCHAT
That kind of patience, especially I think you can do it if you want to get into painting a little bit more for fun.	CHITCHAT
You should you should try.	CHITCHAT
So for me, I started with traditional art, drawing and then I got into painting about 6 years ago, I got into digital art before that.	CHITCHAT
I did traditional but I did specifically drawing so I didn't do any painting with color or used.	CHITCHAT
All lines instead of instead of shapes so it was a really big adjustment for me at first getting into painting because that was a big difference.	CHITCHAT
You know what I mean, it was definitely a big difference seeing things in shapes rather than outlines and it took me quite a while getting used to that.	CHITCHAT
But my point is you can definitely shift that mindset or like sort of.	CHITCHAT
Add to your Add something to your repertoire, you can totally do it.	CHITCHAT
It's not like you're stuck you're stuck with that.	CHITCHAT
One thing you can definitely expand it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, her hair over here is looking very, very smooth.	O
I guess that's OK part of me wants to like bring some other textures and her hair, but I think if I zoom out and look at the overall image.	CHITCHAT
It's probably for the best to keep her hair smooth.	O
We've got a different texture going for the fabric for the background for the hair and skin so.	O
Probably all right, the way it is.	CHITCHAT
Oh, we never I never went back and did.	O

A lot more work on the hands.	O
Well, I guess they don't maybe need a lot more work, but I do want to add.	CHITCHAT
I do want to add a fingernail at least to her one finger that we see against the face so let's do that.	O
Did you do?	CHITCHAT
Very important.	CHITCHAT
Oops wrong layer.	O
OK, so now we've got an outline of the fingernail.	O
We don't have to get very detailed with this.	O
It's for the best that we don't get very detailed with it because it's not really something we want to draw a lot of attention.	O
But it's just the this looks a little odd if there's no fingernail.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So we can maybe give a little bit of a pink shade to the to the nail.	O
I kind of would like to keep it.	O
In a natural kind of color.	O
I don't necessarily need it took like there's nail Polish or anything, but just you have a natural little bit of a huge shift there.	O
And we can add a little bit of a shine or something like that.	O
OK, I think that's enough.	CHITCHAT
It's not something that I want to attract a ton of attention.	O
Oh, thank you so much Karen.	CHITCHAT
I'm really happy that it still full.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome to hear if you if you ever have any questions or or anything, you're welcome to ask also.	CHITCHAT
But well while I was zoomed in I think I think I will clean up some last little things on the.	O
The hand here just maybe give little detail in between the fingers a tiny bit and.	O
Just a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Can always lower the opacity?	O
Do make it a little bit softer?	O
But we've got some hard edges because I originally painted this with the lasso tool.	O
Up.	CHITCHAT
Airbrush kind of combo.	O
Just taking a moment to think about what else I might like to do.	CHITCHAT
Make a new layer and grab the Airbrush.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Can add a little bit?	CHITCHAT
More highlights to her skin and a little bit more of a pink Hue.	O
Just get a little bit more depth to her to her skin.	O
Funny I'm saying depth when I'm adding highlights but I think you know what I mean, a little bit more richness.	O
You know a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Variety to the colors.	O
So after I've been working on a painting for awhile.	CHITCHAT
I've had this with a couple of streams.	CHITCHAT
I'll tend to.	CHITCHAT
Kind of put the painting aside and just return to it like the next day or in a few hours and just take one last look 'cause sometimes.	CHITCHAT
I'll finish stream and I'll think I'm pretty happy with it, but later after taking a break and looking at it again.	CHITCHAT
I'll find something that's standing out to me that I didn't really notice before so I think it's always nice if you don't have a deadline like uh if you don't have an immediate deadline, where you have to send something off to a client or or post it by a certain day.	CHITCHAT

Hi there, MD on sale a high everyone.	CHITCHAT
Welcome I'm just kind of finishing up a portrait painting here.	CHITCHAT
Let me zoom out so you can see this is my reference here on the Top left, you can find a link to that, if you're interested below the stream in the description.	CHITCHAT
So you guys, I'm going to try adding some last little highlights here compared to the reference my image is.	O
A little bit less bright in the face so I'm going to come back in and add like one last.	O
Pass of highlights like on the tip of the nose areas that are really getting hit by a bright light and there's a little bit of Sheen to her skin and there's a couple of places like this like above kind of above the eyebrow what I'm doing is I'm painting it in pretty boldly with a brush and then I'm going to use a smudge brush.	O
To kind of?	CHITCHAT
Blurry into her skin a little bit so it's going to appear really intense.	O
At first, but then we're going to like tone, it down so don't worry.	O
Don't worry.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be OK.	CHITCHAT
So painted in.	CHITCHAT
Smudge it out if you go too much with these kind of highlights it ends up looking like.	O
The person is a you know they just just got out of the shower or something there.	O
It'll make them look wet or greasy or something.	O
So we just want a little bit of like natural Sheen to the skin in a way that will feel.	O
Nice usually I'll paint it.	O
On one layer and then decide if we want to lower the opacity or something like that will decide if it's too much.	O
Kind of feeling between they just draw that uh Oh.	CHITCHAT
I see what I can prove.	CHITCHAT
But overall, I'm happy that's a very good place to be and I think.	CHITCHAT
That's a good spot to be in.	CHITCHAT
It's always good to look for things to improve and be be aware of that.	CHITCHAT
But at the same time, he definitely it's I think it's a It's always nice if you can at least find something in your painting that you like.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
That helps keep.	CHITCHAT
Keep things encouraging I think like for me.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't like all the paintings that I do of course, and I think everyone can relate.	CHITCHAT
You like some you'll be happy with something and maybe not so much something else.	CHITCHAT
Not every painting is going to go well.	CHITCHAT
But if you can at least find something in there that you're like OK.	CHITCHAT
I like how painted this one area that was cool.	CHITCHAT
I learned something.	CHITCHAT
And then move on to the next thing.	CHITCHAT
I'll try to think next time, but I will promise it won't change to a building or something.	CHITCHAT
That sounds that sounds like a deal.	CHITCHAT
If you have been warned.	CHITCHAT
Ah, thank you live in.	CHITCHAT

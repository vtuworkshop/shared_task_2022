A little bit of Sheen to the skin on the fingers or we're almost done.	O
Like for this one, I could sit here and nitpick a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
My painting, but I think it's OK to just say.	CHITCHAT
I learned something I'm happy with something so not everything is OK and then put we learned into the next painting.	CHITCHAT
What I'd like to improve from for the next one from this one is maybe maybe this skin?	CHITCHAT
Maybe the skin could improve a little bit more.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Anyway I think we're about done.	O
I hope you guys like it.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I will probably like I said earlier.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably take another look at this after taking a little break from working on it, and maybe I'll clean up some little things here, there if I see anything.	CHITCHAT
I want to change, but I think this one is finished.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to share in the chat a link to my Instagram so I post.	CHITCHAT
My work here on behalf.	CHITCHAT
Of course, but I generally like to post my favorite things or my more you know more of my like portfolio pieces here so.	CHITCHAT
I'm a us some of the things that I paint on stream.	CHITCHAT
I'll post here and some of them.	CHITCHAT
I will probably just share on my Instagram or something like that, so if you really want to see the paintings.	CHITCHAT
The finished ones posted somewhere you can check both places.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, so this one will appear in one of those places when I decide how much I.	CHITCHAT
How much I like it later but?	CHITCHAT
I really enjoyed the stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm so happy that a couple of you guys painted along.	CHITCHAT
I love seeing what you did.	CHITCHAT
You guys are welcome anyone who's listening in your welcome to join in next time if you like I am here every Wednesday and we do this and I share my references if you want to join in you can no pressure but?	CHITCHAT
Thank you Jackson if anybody else was painting along and you want to share please.	CHITCHAT
Go ahead and just let me know that way.	CHITCHAT
I will make sure to wait for you, if you're busy right now with with uploading the image.	CHITCHAT
I'll give you a little bit of time to do that.	CHITCHAT
But we are reaching we're reaching the end, some last little finishing details and things I can show you in the mean time I don't think it's needed, so much on this one because I kind of addressed this earlier on.	CHITCHAT
But one thing I do.	O
Sometimes is make a new layer on Top of my painting and put it on multiply mode and I'll choose a color.	O
Let's choose like a Brown and make a little bit of like a vignette around the outside.	O
I try to be a little bit sparing with this because it can be very obvious and it can be a bit over.	O
It can be too much.	O
But just a little bit like I put it now at 20% just a little bit.	O
You don't really notice and it.	O
Let's you it kind of draws your eye in over from the edges in towards the center.	O
Thank you a sling more.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much and thank you.	CHITCHAT
Karen I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
Yes, there will be a recording Kevin after the stream ends.	CHITCHAT

There's a videos tab and this will be there and all my past streams are there too.	CHITCHAT

Hello everyone hello everyone at this late hour.	CHITCHAT
Could I have your I'm just doing some livestreaming on testing out a couple things I'm going to be doing some surreal portraits in photo shop and it's good to have you here.	O
So I'm going to go ahead and?	CHITCHAT
Go live right now.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Welcome everyone good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
Palm training diving into some Photoshop magic.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully you appreciate this looks like.	CHITCHAT
Everything is live and again just got a new set up and I'm super excited about it.	CHITCHAT
So if you are out there.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to say hello that be fantastic because otherwise I feel quite alone and.	CHITCHAT
Nobody likes to be alone right This is actually a sneak preview of some stuff.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be doing tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
You can see right here, creating some surreal portraits.	O
I posted this to Instagram.	O
2 days ago and realized it has some issues.	O
Some of the issues are really this jaw line right here.	O
How drastic that is.	O
It's pretty intense.	O
So this is one thing I need to fix and I could use your critical eye as well so.	O
Fantastic.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, thank you for my viewers on Periscope or Twitter or whatever.	CHITCHAT
You wanna call it as well as be hands.	CHITCHAT
Also on YouTube.	CHITCHAT
So this is the issue.	CHITCHAT
I need to fix like this gap.	O
This is looks funny.	O
You know what I didn't notice it and this might happen to you.	CHITCHAT
You won't notice something weird until like a day later when you wake up and you look at it and you're like Oh.	CHITCHAT
I need to fix that right.	O
It's that jaw piece right here.	O
So actually what I'm going to do is going to command J.	O
I'm going to jump that or duplicate that layer right here.	O
I'm going to try to create something I'll maybe delete that layer mask.	O
I actually need a flip it command T flip horizontal and I'm just going to try to get like it just needs a little something right there, so that's all I'm doing for this little portrait or whatever.	O
You want to call it as I start to kind of Patch that in and again.	O
We're just going to kind of play with.	CHITCHAT
What I think that will work and it's going to actually probably take a little distorting so feel free to say hello would love to hear from you.	CHITCHAT
Would be great again, nobody's up?	CHITCHAT
At this hour except for me.	CHITCHAT
Um again see this piece is going to bring that out, like so.	O
Maybe it's that part of the job.	O
But I can also do is I can convert this to a smart object right.	O
So now that it's a smart object, and that's just this jaw.	O
I can start to distort this a little bit and what I actually like to use a lot of is right over here puppet warp so that's what I want to do for this one so edit puppet warp.	O
Adding some pins right in here, pinning down some parts that I don't want to move and then maybe grabbing some of this and kind of pulling it out OK.	O
So that's all I'm doing is trying to pull that out, and make it look less weird is kind of the thought OK, so let me know what you think would love to hear from you.	CHITCHAT
About anything that looks funny.	CHITCHAT
But I think it just needs a little something extra on this side right.	O
So it's just not so funny looking already that looks like a lot better, but it looks like she has really big teeth so.	O
Yes, Steve late in the evening for me.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Steve for Chiming in your in New Zealand.	CHITCHAT
So it's probably early for you.	CHITCHAT

It's like.	CHITCHAT
Almost midnight here in.	CHITCHAT
Goodall Denver, sorry I've been sneezing, too, which is not good.	CHITCHAT
But I'm fixing this whole like horsemouth issue and I think I fixed it?	CHITCHAT
What do you think Steve?	CHITCHAT
Let me know what you think uh must go ahead and show that full screen tab tab?	CHITCHAT
Not sure why both tabs are not working.	CHITCHAT
But I think that looks a little better, so let me know what you think Steve.	CHITCHAT
And Anwar would be awesome.	CHITCHAT
This is Ginger Ale by the way I don't know make a weird.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
I think I fixed it so That being said, I want to move on to the next one right.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I could save this we can go into the history of panel and I can see this start?	O
This is where it started from.	O
And then here is kind of where I've ended up with that and what I was doing was fixing this part right here, making it look a little less weird.	O

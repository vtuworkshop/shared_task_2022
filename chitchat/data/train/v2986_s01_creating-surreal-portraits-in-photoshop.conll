I hope I did it.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
The texture on the skeleton is a bit odd.	O
Uhm yeah, maybe you're right.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it is a gold the texture.	O
So the cool thing is, is I can fix that, so I can go into dimension by the way I don't know why this has been saving for 3 days.	O
So I might have to force quit dimension, it literally is been saving for a couple days.	CHITCHAT
I thought I'd give it time.	CHITCHAT
Let's force quit that baby I might have lost that file that kind of sucks.	CHITCHAT
Basically, that's a texture that I made so I actually do not have that exact view, which is a bummer.	O
Julia good to see you here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's midnight.	CHITCHAT
You are up late as well.	CHITCHAT
I'm testing out actually my new setup if you're curious to see how it looks.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to post it too.	CHITCHAT
I don't know Instagram stories, or something but got a whole new set up here that I'm kind of testing out and I'm also testing bandwidth, which seems to be pretty good.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, what I do is jump in here and I actually used.	O
I think I used a silver mirror.	O
But I could have used a natural gold and then I have this damaged gold right so that's why it's a matter of.	O
Give me a second I'm in miscellaneous.	CHITCHAT
I control down models and I used a couple things here.	O
'cause check this out.	CHITCHAT
Stylize skeleton boom drop in this in this is actually what I would do Muriel.	O
Yes, I am going to go to Lisbon lucky enough to go to Lisbon, Portugal for Adobe Max Europe.	CHITCHAT
There's a debate on whether it should be.	CHITCHAT
They're wondering if it should like they're concerned that you know they don't want it to mimic.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
The US version, too much so.	CHITCHAT
They might kind of change it a little bit.	CHITCHAT
But what I'm doing is I'm selecting a couple.	O
I got this fibula pelvis.	O
I'm deleting.	O
No yeah, I do need to delete that.	O
Fibula as well, we're learning about.	O
The human body.	O
I didn't hear.	CHITCHAT
I'm guessing with parts.	CHITCHAT
I actually don't need a lot of this, but I'm actually going to render this out.	O
This all looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Do you wanna tell me how have you been have you been liking Colorado?	CHITCHAT
Tell me these little spots right here?	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Narrators Patella so using this tool right over here and again.	O
I'm in Adobe.	O
Dimension selecting the sampler tool.	O
Oh, sorry not the sampler tool.	O
The one above it so right there.	O
Magic wand tool.	O
I can click right on that object OK.	O
That's the Patella.	O
We're learning things right.	O
But it enables me to just locate that specific item right.	O
It's actually not what it's used for but it's like Super Helpful.	O
In finding.	O
I'm actually deleting the textures, but ultimately I get to delete.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Object itself.	O
Yes, it is a little cold.	CHITCHAT
'cause if you're coming from where you would think you were in El A.	CHITCHAT
Before this.	CHITCHAT
Correct me if I'm wrong, but, yeah, it is a little cold just so you know it actually has not been this cold.	CHITCHAT
In awhile so I think this is like a rarity to be honest with you.	CHITCHAT
This is usually not this cold.	CHITCHAT
We usually don't have snow on the ground for this long, but when we do it's usually happens.	CHITCHAT
In February, an March OK, so we have really relate winters, but it's no different.	CHITCHAT
Then any other place sorry if this is not that interesting to some people I think you're learning, you should be learning a lot.	CHITCHAT
Right in here, grabbing this pelvis right.	O
OK, so that looks good enough so sorry there's so much.	CHITCHAT
I need to do right in here and it's because I lost a file but what I want to do is actually want to match this up with an image that I already have so I'll jump into people.	O
Um and hope that view by group.	O

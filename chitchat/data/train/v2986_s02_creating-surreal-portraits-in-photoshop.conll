Right 'cause I have everything categories categorized nice and neat.	O
Uhm it's just a matter of where I put that specific one which might be.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Actually, no, I'm sorry, it is a stone element, so I apologize.	O
We're going to ride this out for a little bit.	O
And we'll go back to miscellaneous so sorry about that, but I have a zillion different things in here.	CHITCHAT
That I need to kind of take care of textures patterns.	O
Miscellaneous category for all of this ultimately.	O
I want to have dive into the statues.	O
I'm sorry I'm not as.	CHITCHAT
I feel a little less prepared, but again, I'm just testing live streaming right now to make sure my.	CHITCHAT
Other computer can actually keep up.	CHITCHAT
OK, male female lifestyle motion, not grouped OK I need statue.	O
Let's try this out there, it is there, it is dropping it in the background, you got it OK so.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
What Julia you're going to Florida?	CHITCHAT
Hey Rufus, what's up, buddy, I'm just testing some live streaming?	CHITCHAT
That's why it's a little late here, but it seems to be working out well.	CHITCHAT
I got a kind of a nice setup.	CHITCHAT
I actually have them re purposing an old monitor that I have.	CHITCHAT
You can see actually dropped in this background right in here that I want to use so it's kind of go into the properties right in here.	O
We see background match image and what I want to do is actually resize.	O
The canvas and create lights based on that background image 'cause.	O
I'm going to have this 3D object.	O
Sort of mimic this particular pose so that's the idea.	O
So yes, Rufus I'm like so excited about going to Lisbon.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it's just like so thrilled.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be awesome.	CHITCHAT
Super excited about it, so this is just the background.	CHITCHAT
So what's nice about this?	CHITCHAT
Is I can control this whole plane right?	O
And it's not going to mess up this background image.	O
But I can kind of get this into position.	O
I'll typically kinda like zoom in more.	O
I could also resize this skeleton as well.	O
But ultimately what I need to do is I need to get rid of this head place a new head on there and actually use some of my textures that I have already squared away.	O
Clear right there by the way I can actually use.	O
Substance painter to actually make my own textures, but I happen to have some in here already.	O
Give me one second people.	CHITCHAT
Let's actually go into the starter assets 'cause.	O
I know right in here.	CHITCHAT
We have textures down here.	O
So I can grab some clean gold drop it.	O
On that particular shape.	O
You see what it's going to do it might sometimes just apply it to that specific object So what you can always do is grab.	O
This scratch texture and Drop it on the layers panel and that will apply it everywhere as well so that might be easier when it comes to applying textures or materials afraid you're right.	O
It is it is Valentine's Day.	CHITCHAT
Happy Valentine's Day.	CHITCHAT
To you as well so again I can get this into position.	O
The reason I'm doing this is because Steve was kind enough to point out that like maybe there's something weird about the gold texture.	CHITCHAT
I think he might be right.	CHITCHAT
I will say what the issue might be is that it.	CHITCHAT
Might not be reflecting enough of the statue around it, so that's kind of the issue here.	O
But I think we've already done a good job of kind of fixing the skeleton in this part so I'm just going to go ahead and call this done, but I did want to point out how this was originally made which was by taking this positioning.	O
It's based on that photo in the background, rendering it OK.	O
And then doing some compositing in Photoshop.	O
Ha.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the rendering I don't know I think the renderings pretty strong.	O
I don't think we've it's still verea under the hood by the way so I don't think we've changed anything there.	O
There is cloud, rendering now, which is nice.	O
But since I have a bunch of experts with me today.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and that's OK.	CHITCHAT
I think it maybe maybe the issue is Steve by the way if it's being actually kind of exposed through this statue.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's actually like super rough so actually what I should use is used some of this damaged wait for it.	CHITCHAT

So.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
Libraries come on now where is it miscellaneous?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, better being here 3D?	O
I got so much stuff in here look at all this stuff Oh that's why the check this out.	CHITCHAT
You can sometimes view by type in view by group OK, so you ever can't can't find something you could view by type.	O
It 'cause I know I need to find a material.	O
I just don't know where it is now I can.	CHITCHAT
Locate this damaged material right here.	O
Drop it on an again.	O
I can drop it.	CHITCHAT
On the layers panel.	O
It's going to go ahead and apply it and this might be something that Steve is looking for so it is rougher.	O
I do also need to make sure that.	O
The lighting also comes from uh.	O
The image as well so everything looks good, there, the environment light comes from that image.	O
And then we have a couple other lights so maybe this will work better.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I think it's still like 2 yellow.	O
I'm not huge fan of it, but it's kind of move on.	O
All right.	CHITCHAT
Cool Julia Yeah, so that's all I did by the way Julie if you're interested again.	CHITCHAT
I rendered this out.	O
I put this as a background.	O
I positioned everything into place and then I rendered it.	O
The cool thing is, is once you render it.	O
You then have everything in layers.	O
Um, I'd have to kind of dig through.	O
Oh, here, we go here's here's the situation after the render this is what you have.	O
You have something like this?	CHITCHAT
You can see this layers panel and the skeleton might be a little bright for Steve that's OK.	O
We can take that background image duplicate it put it on Top.	O
Close that up what I do with this background image.	O
I'm just going to go ahead and Rasterize.	O
It 'cause I like having access to this remove background buttons right in here.	O
Remove background now.	O
I have this right on type.	O
This background OK.	O
Let's take that let's take this, let's apply that as a mask.	O
I'm doing stuff kind of quick, but this is what's happening exposed underneath that woman is going to be the skeleton so I'm going to turn that on I'm going to go ahead and convert this to a smart object.	O
So I still have that layer mask in case I need it.	O
I'm going to create a new layer mask and I'm going to start painting with black.	O
You guys did you know how it works hard round zometa use come in here and start painting over this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make sure the flow is set up to 100% and I'm kind of revealing some of the skeleton right there as you can see how that's done OK.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
You probably also notice that this does not have the devil, so there's a couple different ways to do this.	O
I can actually double click on this layer and add bevel and emboss to this layer and I'm going to make sure that's on an inner bevel OK and the lighting comes from say like the upper left would be good OK.	O
It's still pretty intense.	O
I can kind of take that down.	O
Tweek this all I want I actually wanted to be a little more shallow so I'm going to take the size down but that's what I have right there OK.	O
They are good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
Thea I did not know you see it's good to have you here.	CHITCHAT
This is why it's good to kind of broadcast?	CHITCHAT
I guess at different times again just kind of testing out.	CHITCHAT
Testing out my.	CHITCHAT
New set up that I'm so proud of.	CHITCHAT
And I'm glad I can do this and actually everything's been going at.	CHITCHAT
100%.	CHITCHAT
Sweet get right in here, I can take this opacity down as well.	O
That gives me like a quick preview of some of these parts.	O
I can kind of add that just get the sternum.	O
Some of the ribs, maybe thin, it up a little bit like do some little dots right there.	O
You get the idea.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of having some fun with this here like so OK cool.	CHITCHAT
Down here you get the idea.	O
Right adding to this and the increasing the Opacity.	O
So obviously like revealing it.	O
It is an all or nothing issue.	O
I would actually kind of come in here and as I add this.	O
I know I need to add some shading later because this is not.	O
This skeleton is not really respecting a whole lot of the shading so new layer and I've been like sneezing like crazy.	O
Brush.	O
Adding a brush taking the actually you know what this is what I have for my so many things.	O
Mike I get to see you buddy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Chris This is a late live stream that is exactly right.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to use old softy that's what I call it's brush I made but I just know it's going to be a soft brush with only 2% flow.	O
'cause all I want to do is like add a little bit of shading right down here on this particular skeleton just making it nice and smooth and make sure it respects kind of the lighting of this particular photo right you get the idea.	O

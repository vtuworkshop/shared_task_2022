Let's go back up here always changes back to hard round.	O
'cause I'm going to expose more.	O
Later on as well boom boom.	CHITCHAT
Crank it up.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
Wrong layer there, we are.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
White painting with White, 100% opacity.	O
I'm on the wrong layer that's the problem didn't you hate it after freaking 25 years.	O
I'm still painting on the wrong layer right.	O
It's always like the little things.	CHITCHAT
But right in here just kind of reveal more because I think it's more interesting when you can kind of see more of the chest and just be kind of like cooler for our stream today.	CHITCHAT
Add some like so open to your opinions.	CHITCHAT
I think 2 minds are better than one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's late here in early somewhere else.	CHITCHAT
Julia you are going to did you say Florida soon?	CHITCHAT
That's super cool.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Right in here.	O
There we go now you know how this is made.	CHITCHAT
Uh say Steve mocked up a bunch of wrong layers as well, OK, so you get the idea of how this was essentially created and how I got to this point.	CHITCHAT
I want to Fast forward by the way I did a lot of color treatment.	O
I can do more with this.	O
I want to fast more forward to this one.	O
I was actually working on this early today to live stream on it, and we can talk about some of the issues that you have with it.	CHITCHAT
'cause a lot of this, you need to just kind of respect.	CHITCHAT
The lighting.	O
So where's the lighting coming from well essentially I'm having the lighting come from?	O
Up here right This is where the light source should be so that's why right in here.	O
I'm going to have some shadow, but also I need to make parts of these a little bit darker.	O
Parts of these Flowers, OK, so that's the big issue and then we can work on some color correction things like Julie's doing some packing.	O
For Florida, you are up late 'cause.	CHITCHAT
It is midnight here in beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Denver Co where myself and Julia Live.	CHITCHAT
She's South of me and Highlands Ranch.	CHITCHAT
I love Highlands Ranch.	CHITCHAT
I know that area all too well.	CHITCHAT
And yet I'm really into it, you take 470 around to the airport makes it super easy right.	CHITCHAT
You see a number of things that were put together all that it is I split this.	O
I used warp distorted it and you get the idea Mohammed from China.	O
OK Mohammed from China welcome OK.	CHITCHAT
Some little parts right here like this bothers me like this needs some more shading So what I can do hold down the command key and then you can click another thing you can do as well.	O
And this is brand new if I hold down the option key and click on that layer.	O
I can zoom right to that object right and here is the object that I need to work on there is little issues that you know.	O
Need to be fixed like there's a little bit of.	O
Um sort of glowy edge right here that needs to be taken care of right that needs to be fixed.	O
If we really got in all the details like right in here look at that.	O
Somebody didn't do a good job of cleaning this up.	O
But you know what this is a library item so I clean it off once and then it fixes.	O
All of my compositions.	O
'cause if you know me hyper I've used Flowers away, too much.	O
That's the short of it, OK brush.	O
Fixing that's changing this.	O
Right in here, I have a brightness and contrast layer.	O
So why do that it allows me to make this all darker?	O
I have these darker elements but I actually get to paint with that darkness so on that layer had beef brush and I'm going to start painting with white an essentially even though I'm hanging on the white this actually making those parts darker so I can kind of darker dark and this part inside of here just kind of adding a little bit more depth to each one of these like little pedals for these Flowers.	O
Maybe on the inside here, you get the idea just giving it a little bit more depth.	O
So it's not so flat again, you can see that I've done some of that work already.	O
It's a little bit, too, dark as I zoom out.	O
I can go back into brightness and contrast and increase that brightness just a touch alright cool mirror.	O

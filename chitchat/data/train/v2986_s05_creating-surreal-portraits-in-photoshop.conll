I'll have a good day at work and get a roll I get it.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Fantastic always add more drama open to whatever else this needs, but you can see how this is put together it actually.	CHITCHAT
I think it looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
We have some little parts right here.	O
That kind of need to be fixed.	O
Those little dots.	O
Those actually come from the original photo.	O
It's nice.	CHITCHAT
We can hold on the command key and click on those.	O
I can see it's part of this flower.	O
So for that particular flower.	O
I'm going to select those parts.	O
Unless he said that as a mask, there, you go boom done.	O
More drama that's why we need drama in a good way.	CHITCHAT
So I would say I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm open to opinion.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if this is really working or not working.	CHITCHAT
If you're having an issue with any design that you're working on yeah, definitely take a step away.	CHITCHAT
I could already see when I look at it on my second monitor the fact that I'm seeing it.	CHITCHAT
Smaller I'm kind of noticing some weirdness like.	CHITCHAT
Does it even need this flower here like maybe less is more for some of this right great thing is how this is put together right, I can kind of move that down.	O
Like so right.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's really working that's why I need you guys.	CHITCHAT
OK, so Steve brings up a great point, perhaps a be on one of those Flowers did it.	CHITCHAT
Do we introduce some elements kind of around.	O
These Flowers rather than everything crammed into one area and I think that's a great idea.	O
I'm not going to be.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually going to use a butterfly 'cause.	O
Guess what I have 1000 butterflies right.	O
You can see them all right in here and straw in like I'm doing right now.	O
The big thing is, is if I'm doing any sort of compositing.	O
I want to make sure that the size is realistic.	O
So I'm not going to have this beat or excuse me.	O
This butterfly, too large or too small.	O
I want to make sure it's the right size.	O
Considering the size of this woman's face flip that around adjust it move it.	O
You know, and I can drop it into place, the nice thing.	O
I like about this is I can actually put this kind of off a little bit.	O
And I also need to consider the colour because the yellow introduces like almost like a new color.	O
It's almost too intense compared to this washed out yellow down here.	O
Ooh Yes, Steve you are brilliant.	CHITCHAT
Love the idea of a Hummingbird.	CHITCHAT
Love the idea of a Hummingbird, you're so good.	CHITCHAT
Right.	CHITCHAT
So again for this butterfly, I would probably.	O
Go into human saturation.	O
Clip that to that layer mask.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Kind of play with that a little bit.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Again, you play with it each time you play something you kind of learn something more.	CHITCHAT
How do you export from dimension 2 photo shop it was easy you don't need to export you just do a render so right in here after this side instead of entitled you'd say, you know skeleton.	O
Hi for slow let's do low for fast.	O
It's going to render out a PSD and it's going to give you all those layers so super easy big thing I do is save this file save as.	O
Wait, for it to the desktop.	O
Boom boom render and guess what you can actually do crowd crap cloud rendering as well.	O
Saving the desktop.	O
Although I'm not sure why it's not allowing me to render right now that button should be available, so anyways.	O
That's where this came from.	O
This could use some sparkles as well, I had to update photo shop so ilost.	O
All my sparkles which is just so bad have been testing.	CHITCHAT
Some new versions.	CHITCHAT
'cause we have some new things coming next week?	CHITCHAT
Which I'm super excited about but guess what, if you join me for my daily creative challenge.	CHITCHAT
You would know that I actually gave you some.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Sparkles.	CHITCHAT
And that's what I'm going to use now is.	O
Locating my lens flares is what I made.	O

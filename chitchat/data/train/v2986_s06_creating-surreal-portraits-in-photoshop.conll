Opening this up.	O
'cause I'm thinking it needs a little bit of magic.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's go to our brushes.	O
I'm going to wind down now, it is midnight, 17 minutes after midnight.	CHITCHAT
and I have to live stream in the morning but I'm glad everything is working specially after live streaming for a bit L lens flares.	CHITCHAT
There's there.	CHITCHAT
The adrs with these bottom ones.	CHITCHAT
Let's make this smaller wait for it increase the flow.	O
Make it much smaller bam there's a.	O
There's a sparkle?	O
What else do we have we got this sweet 1.	CHITCHAT
Sure, the shape dynamics change, so the size is going to change.	O
The angle is going to change right we can see a little preview right down here just going to look so cool and then we're going to scatter it as well going to crank up the scattering.	O
Analysts make sure the minutes.	CHITCHAT
Huh cool.	CHITCHAT
I think that works I could play with color dynamics and other things.	O
I know 'cause.	CHITCHAT
It was so large when I first created it if you're not get involved.	CHITCHAT
The daily created challenges.	CHITCHAT
You should but now as I sort of like paint.	CHITCHAT
You can see, those sort of sparkles popping up.	O
So that's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
I don't know now that I see it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not crazy about that line, 'cause, you can see it's definitely like uniform.	O
I could always take.	O
These settings lock them.	O
Locking all of those the shape dynamics and scattering that's what I played with and then pick a different brush.	O
Let's try that on a new layer.	O
It's going to be this burst.	O
Let's make it smaller.	O
Let's test it out boom OK perfect there's are sparkles.	O
Right and I can do.	O
Smaller larger you get the idea just kind of having some fun with some sparkles there.	O
Alright cool OK now you're getting some interruptions in the feed.	CHITCHAT
I will check everything and into this right now.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for hanging out with me.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of making some dramatic portraits as you can see right here just having fun with images.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for joining me, who I see it right now.	CHITCHAT
I saw for a second.	CHITCHAT
That's it dropped a little bit below optimum so that's probably what you're seeing as well so thanks for joining me Steve.	CHITCHAT
Bernice Sean Patricia Micah.	CHITCHAT
Luke.	CHITCHAT
Mohammed.	CHITCHAT
James and William as well, cool, thanks so much for everybody for joining me it's a late stream fun test.	CHITCHAT
Let's hang out more later on, I'll be live streaming at 9:30 AM Pacific Time Marrying 2D with 3D but making it look realistic right.	CHITCHAT
'cause chances are you're not going to be able to find you might be able to but you might not be able to find an image with that perfect angle of that item so that's one 3D comes into play.	CHITCHAT
We're going to make it look realistic and we have some fun so it cheers Steve and a frozen everyone.	CHITCHAT
Have a good one Rufus if you're still there and Julia as she finishes packing hopefully soon Mohammed.	CHITCHAT

Good afternoon, everyone happy Monday it's that time of day once again for another live stream.	CHITCHAT
Welcome my name is Terry white worldwide design and photography evangelist and it is my pleasure to be streaming to you Live Today.	CHITCHAT
Today we're gonna take a look at something that I don't remember the last time I've talked about as a dedicated topic.	CHITCHAT
I usually just interspersed it in with other topics.	CHITCHAT
But today, we're going to spend some time talking about Adobe fonts now if you're wondering what's Adobe fonts.	O
You might remember maybe not the name type kit.	CHITCHAT
So I think it was about a year ago that Adobe Typekit became officially branded Adobe fonts and typed.	O
It was a company.	CHITCHAT
We had acquired years back.	CHITCHAT
So just bring it all under the Adobe naming and branding.	CHITCHAT
But with that branding also came some features and some benefits for those of you who are creative.	CHITCHAT
Cloud members to take advantage of your Adobe fonts so I see some folks already in the room less Tyrone Game Changer Tom.	CHITCHAT
Um Mezini If I'm saying it correctly.	CHITCHAT
Bobby welcome as well as he some folks over on Twitter and Janzow Frog, just joined an of course, Victoria's over.	CHITCHAT
There holding it down on Facebook with 86 or 87 current lurkers.	CHITCHAT
People that just hanging out alright so with that, said, and also some books on should be popping on be handsome kind of doing a multiplatform stream today, so we're on 4 platforms simultaneously.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there's Barney.	CHITCHAT
And and Jamie from Richmond, so with that, said let's go ahead and dive in and take a look at what I'm going to show you today before I even show you that let's get over there, OK and let me switch over to my desktop so you guys can see what I'm talking about and I'm going to start off in the creative Cloud Desktop app now in the creative Cloud Desktop app.	O
This is where by the way.	CHITCHAT
This has been redesigned has been way better than it used to be, but this is where most people.	CHITCHAT
I think 100% of people start when they sign up with creative cloud.	O
They want to download their apps.	O
They go to this page.	O
They click on the ones they want to install and install them in lives happy great.	O
But if you didn't pay attention to anything beyond that, then you'd be missing some of the other categories here for example, the mobile apps, which you would normally install from your respective app stores.	O
But you can have it send you a link to your device so you can just click on the link or.	O
Cap on the link to be able to install that but if we look over here in the lower left.	O
There's a section specifically for fonts and if we were to go to the Web Category Adobe fonts would be listed there as well.	O
Now you notice any of the web ones say launch.	O
That's because there are based in a web browser.	O
There is no app called Adobe fonts.	O
It's all web based even though Adobe fonts integrate with your Adobe apps.	O
So, but there's not a dedicated app for Adobe fonts.	O
It's all web based or sinking based.	O
I should say cloud based that would be the best way to say it alright so if I were to launch that.	O
It'll take me to the web page as long as I'm logged in with my Adobe ID, it gives me a kind of a little quick start hanging.	O
Find your favorites.	O
You could use them anywhere.	O
Unlimited font, you so that's one of the things that is new as of this rebranding of Adobe fonts is there used to be this artificial limit.	O
I forgot what it was and it was about 135 different fonts could be active at one time now we never enforced the limit.	O
We never said.	CHITCHAT
Up you reach the limit can activate anymore.	O
But you might have got a warning, saying Hey, you're at 130.	O
437.	O
You need to do something about that and now that snow are in case you can have as many active at one time as you want now with that, said, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should we get in the habit of activating fonts 'cause we use them and then that's it.	O
They just stay active for the rest of your life and you end up with literally.	O
Hundreds and hundreds if not thousands, of active fonts and no more fonts you have active on your computer Mac or windows.	O
The slower things will be so if you're trying to get a quick performance boost.	O
You might take some time to go.	O
Deactivate fonts are not using anymore.	O
You can always go reactivate them later.	O
How would you know which ones you're using or which ones are not using well by click OK on this message at the very Top.	O
It's telling me it's giving giving me my little warning.	CHITCHAT
Hey to keep your devices speedy remove fonts.	CHITCHAT

You don't need right now.	CHITCHAT
You can always add them back when you want and so over here on the right hand side is a link.	O
That let's me review my active font, so if I were to click on that it should.	O
Take me to a list of all the fonts that I have activated and I can usually I have 12 pages worth.	O
I just go through and start deactivating the ones that I don't know.	O
Maybe I use them once and I don't need him right now.	O
So again there's no requirement to do this, you can keep him active as long as you want, but these you know.	O
They're gonna take up resources the more you have open alright, so here's a question uh.	O
Translator OK, so question, Roberts asking this candies fonts be used to create Watermarks If so can they be saved Indian Gee?	O
Well, first of all DNG is a raw format.	O
You don't really save Indian Gee.	O
You have a device that creates profiles.	O
The fonts can be used for anything design.	O
Wise you want so if you want to design A watermark with one of these fonts.	O
You could and use it anyway.	O
You want so for example, I liked Rajan Pro as my watermark when I used text.	O
And I use that in light room as a watermark all the time.	O
So yes, it can be done, but saving in a DMG.	O
That's probably not something you want to do because the engines were not meant to be edited.	O
They were meant to be opened as a raw file and then saved us something else OK.	O
So now that we kind of know where we can go look.	O
In the past, we have active let's go and click on the category called browse fonts.	O
Sure you can say my suping.	CHITCHAT
There's again.	CHITCHAT
Whatever you're currently doing with fonts.	CHITCHAT
Almost everything can be done with these fonts there's not it's not some like these are special, and can't be typed in and saved out and export it out or print it.	O
There fonts so if you want to make a graphic and export a ping.	O
You can there's nothing stopping you from doing that alright so if I go to browse fonts I can look at all the classifications.	O
I can go San serif serif slab serif script so forth and so on.	O
So I just want to narrow it down.	O
Let's say I'm looking for a nice script font.	O
I can see the ones I've already used ones are active.	O
I can view a particular family that I have not used yet and if there is one that I really like like maybe I really want to play around with this votos.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
Folder I guess Bowl, Utah script whatever that is, I can view that font family.	O
And it will show me if there's more than one 'cause some fonts have regular a bold and italic you know, heavy alight all different variations of the font so if there were more than one, I'd see them here and I can activate them 1 by one or I can activate the entire family up here in the upper right hand corner so if I activate that font.	O
That's all it took my machines throughout my creative cloud, so even my other computer will get a message that pops up in the right hand corner at all turned off now, but it was.	O
Show me Hey that fonts been activated on your computer and you would now be able to use it.	O
Not just in your Adobe apps, but you'd be able to use it in any app.	O
If you want to go type in Vault Oval, Utah, whatever that's called script in Microsoft Word you could if you wanted to use it in.	O
Pages on a Mac.	O
You could you can use that font any any program that let's you choose fonts so now that I've activated that if I were to head back over to let's say photo shop create a new document.	O
Let's just make something quick and grab my type tool an hour to click, and I would say cool new font that is.	O
Whatever my default was at the time, which I think is a minion Pro Italic looks like and then I will be able to go up here and say what is that BOLU there?	O
It is bolted script regular and there?	O
It is I'm now start typing.	O
Annette font and to set to answer that question earlier from Robert Brown.	O
I get export this out as a paying the Jpeg's.	O
PSD or anything I want it at this point, so the font size change the color change size change what it says like using any other Phone.	O
Alright so with that, said, Um, one thing that is nice about these fonts is that they are open type in format.	O
So all of them are open type font fonts.	O
That means that depending on the font maker the font creator because we license.	O
These we don't make these so whoever created these fonts could also use them to make it take advantage of the opentype features and add more things like?	O

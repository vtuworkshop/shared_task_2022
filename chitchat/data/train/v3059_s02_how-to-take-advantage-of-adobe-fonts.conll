Alternate glyphs, so when you hover over a character in photo shop or in design for example, I think illustrator as well.	O
But certainly Photoshop and Indesign.	O
It will show you if there any alternates for that font now you might be disappointed there might be none there might be 10 there might be 12 there might be 2 in this case.	O
There are 2 it depends on the font maker Adobe doesn't control that whoever designed this font does so, if I don't like that particular lowercase.	O
FI can use that lower case FI don't like that lower case TI can use.	O
That lower case T so and again that's font by fonts some will have alternate glyphs.	O
Some won't, it doesn't have to be a script font have alternate glyphs.	O
I could be any kind so questions about licensing and packaging so remember when I said most of the features like 99% would work as regular fonts one of them that share and brings up does not these cannot be packaged when packaging is a feature of the app like in design for example, you could package up fonts.	O
With your document to send to someone else and I can open it up and use that document and the fonts would already be there.	O
Now, because of licensing restrictions with Adobe fonts packagings not included.	O
But here's.	O
The thing to think about the reason you usually packet something is so that you could send that whole package.	O
The document all the graphics all the fonts to someone else to open up in the use.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
If I did these in Creative Cloud Desktop apps, which I have for the last 7 years.	O
I'm sending it to someone else to open up more than likely they're going to have creative cloud to open up these file formats.	O
They would just be able to sync that font and use it.	O
It would tell them You're missing.	O
These fonts click.	O
One button sinks them all and then you don't need to package.	O
So yes, packaging is not capable you're not capable not able legally to package Adobe fonts but there for the need for it also doesn't exist like it used to with the other types of box has a licensing work work and we find out about it.	CHITCHAT
So you can find out about anything.	CHITCHAT
The licensing related 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I'm not a lawyer, I'm not going to pretend to be 1.	CHITCHAT
All that other adobe.com if you go to adobe.com probably I'm guessing slash fonts.	O
You can find all the licensing and figure out how that works for example, there might be a license restriction.	O
It says you can't use the font in an app that distributes fonts like so that would be obvious restriction, but again, I'm not going to guess at what the restrictions are from licensing best to go to adobe.com and find out just or not Google, but search on adobe.com.	CHITCHAT
Licensing and you'll find that out.	CHITCHAT
Alright I don't understand.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now someone is asking when you choose a different style in a font package does it change one.	O
You select it or the whole sentence well.	O
That's dipping on the app.	O
That's standard 101 type so for example, by change this F2.	O
It just totally different fonts.	O
I'm going to change the F because that's what I selected if I have it selected as a layer and I go make a font change in the type tool, then that's going to change the whole sentence so that all is Standard Adobe stuff that has nothing to do with Adobe fonts and that pretty much works, the way across the board and.	O
All applications whether there Adobe or not so highlighting you highlight you select to effect.	O
You highlight things that you want to change.	O
But I just want to change the see want to change the whole word cool to something else.	O
Now I can go change that to something else and it would only affect the word cool, so whatever select it gets changed or affected by that change all right.	O
Let me see if I got some questions over here on on Facebook.	CHITCHAT
Hey from Brazil.	CHITCHAT
Hey Rose,	CHITCHAT
Turn turn service from Adobe.	CHITCHAT
Her surveys for there are questions about surveys from Adobe are these surveys free.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure what surveys are talking about sorry bout mists where there's some service.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm not aware of what surveys you're talking about in surveys usually don't cost money so that I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what's always referring to so with that, said, Alright.	CHITCHAT
Let's get back to where we get back on point where we were so we just activated a font.	O
We have popped over to photo shop and used it but do I have to go to the web browser every time I want to use a new font and the answer is absolutely no.	O
You can let's just type something else here.	O
Let's type this.	CHITCHAT

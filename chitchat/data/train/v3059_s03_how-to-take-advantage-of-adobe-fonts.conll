But this is something different.	CHITCHAT
All right and something different is being typed in whatever I was last on which is that vault 2.	O
Bolton whatever it is all right, and now of course, let's say.	O
I want that to be something different like I said, so I can go up here to the font menu.	O
I can pull it down and it will.	O
Show me all my fonts great.	O
These are all the ones that are active at this point.	O
That sound tells me someone's at the door anyway, as I hover over my fonts in most of our applications.	O
Now you can kind of see them as you hover over them so that's kind of cool the next thing you'll notice is that there are icons.	O
On some of the all the fonts.	O
It depends on what the icon is so the creative cloud logo means that those are Adobe fonts the open or Oh for Opentype means that it's an open type font, but not an Adobe font.	O
The open type variable means that it's a variable font.	O
Not necessarily from Adobe fonts and the Opentype SVG means it's an open type color font.	O
I can already see the word or the color in there, so if I look for any of the ones with the logo.	O
I know that any of you could use that same font because it is part of critical out so for example, I could use.	O
What is this adorn engraved and let's make that smaller and that changes?	O
what I typed to indoor adorn engraved now let's say like that font.	O
Let's say that's a font that I kind of want to use on a regular basis.	O
I don't want to have to keep scrolling a menu looking for it.	O
So when I pop down a menu and all of our apps now an first of all.	O
Any font that I use recently will be at the Top which is great, thanks engineers for doing that, so adorna grave is at the Top 'cause I used it recently.	O
But if I don't use it for awhile.	O
It won't be at the Top anymore.	O
So you notice.	O
These little stars that you'll see in our font menus.	O
Now, when you click the star that tells it to make it a favorite font.	O
So now it will always be available when you ask for your favorite fonts, which I'll show you in a minute so if I like that.	O
Bowl to bowl Utah Scriptpro, I could make that a favorite and I've got some other favors that are down in the list.	O
As you can see here as I scroll so that's a favorite.	CHITCHAT
That's a favorite so forth and so now, what if I just want my favorites.	O
I don't wanna have to Scroll down a list looking for stars.	O
Gavin Davis is asking a great question, Gavin get the question.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you brought that up because I'm going to get to that in just a minute, but anyway, I can hit the star at the very Top of the menu.	CHITCHAT
And that will just narrow the list down to anything that I marked as a favorite so.	O
Turn turn turn turn all classes there, we got it will.	CHITCHAT
Show me my favourites and I can scroll through that.	CHITCHAT
I thought I had more favors than that.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's filtering on something else as well.	CHITCHAT
They were that was it OK, so let's get out of that no that's it.	CHITCHAT
I thought I had more favors than that anyway.	CHITCHAT
Show me my favorites.	CHITCHAT
I need to go.	CHITCHAT
Mark some more favourites, but that's how you can narrow the list down to just your favourites Alright.	CHITCHAT
Of course, if you turn that back off and it will show you the whole list.	O
Oh yeah, I guess I only do have those favorites.	O
So let me go.	CHITCHAT
Add one more one that is definitely a favorite.	O
I want to add that as a favorite.	O
I use that font all the time.	O
So now if I go back and filter it should.	O
Show me 4.	O
And yes, it's working so 4 favorite fonts to quickly see just my favorite so that means that of course, you can.	O
Have as many favourites that you want and then filter him down quickly to get to the ones that you like the best so we use that adore engraved before I'm going to go ahead and drop the size back down again and then we'll go ahead and say OK on that all right.	O
Next up, I said, what if you're looking for something different in the list.	O
do I have to go to the web browser every time so if I again?	O
Let's do?	CHITCHAT
Another one.	CHITCHAT
And we'll just go and make that nice, big so we could see it.	O
Another one, and I want to now change that to something else select it and I don't have a something else.	O
Yet so let me uncheck my favourites.	O
An I can go and find and see.	O
It preview any font that I do.	O
But if I go ahead and click the more Adobe fonts option up here at the Top of the list that means.	O
Show me something I don't already have synced and when I do that.	O
That will take me to the web browser and show me other fonts.	O
And what's nice about this is you can type in sample text.	O
So I can say.	CHITCHAT
Give me another one is.	O
Show me what it would look like in those other fonts who I kind of like that.	O

I'm a sucker for script fonts by the way in case you haven't notice so I can narrow it down, I can say show Maine.	CHITCHAT
New scripts this time, let's.	CHITCHAT
Show me the San serif versions of that.	O
Show me the ones that are heavy like heavy thick bought some time.	O
Show me those let me go next and see if I can find one that I really like.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Turn turn turn turn.	CHITCHAT
Amplitude OK, let's say I like Apple II that I want to view that family an it shows me all the ones for amplitude.	O
And as amplitude, Ultra I can again I can activate the whole family, but I'm just looking for the thick one.	O
So I'm just going to say.	CHITCHAT
Give me just that one and that will a message would have popped up but I have it turned off?	O
This says, we've now synced amplitude ultra to this alright.	O
Let's go in now and change this one, too.	O
That font that we just activated ample tude ultra there.	O
It is, and again if I really like that font and I want to use it over and over again, I can use that mark that as a favor OK.	O
So now I just changed it all right there.	O
We go and we can go in and you just keep doing that rinse and repeat keep finding fonts you like.	O
But what if you don't know what you like what, if you don't know like like scrolling through and looking for fonts are great.	O
But what if you just don't find something you like.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
You can actually.	CHITCHAT
Look at font packs.	O
So you can go in.	O
And you can say I don't know what I'm looking for let's go back to the site.	O
And let's go back up and go to font packs.	O
The very next category.	O
And this is some this is like a collection of fonts that designers and put together that said.	O
Hey, you might want to use this collection of fonts for your next project, so for example, you might want to use the holiday party pack.	O
If that's what you're doing is you're doing a party.	O
You might want to use the build build a brand pack.	O
And of course, you're kind of looking at a sample.	O
But if you really want to see what these look like.	O
I'm gonna stay away from scribes would be one that I like.	O
But let's go.	CHITCHAT
Let's go to the party pack view it.	O
And then it will show you all of the fonts in that pack now when you activate a pack.	O
It only activates it for 180 days because of that reason, I mentioned earlier you see, there are several fonts in here if you activate a bunch of pasture and literally going to be activating hundreds of fonts that you may only use once so it's activating it for 180 days, giving you a chance to use it all.	O
You want 480 days, which most people aren't going to use it all.	O
They want is going to use it.	O
A few times and then it will deactivate it if you want to activate him again, you can come back and reactivate him again.	O
Or if you open up a document that used them.	O
It will automatically ask you to activate him again.	O
So you don't have to keep a bunch of plants open that you might only use one time because it was a fun idea at the time and taking up resources.	O
Alright so I'm going to go ahead and activate that pack.	O
It's activating all of the fonts in this pack for me to use and again.	O
It will automatically love that it'll automatically deactivate them 180 days later because chances are first of all chances are I didn't use all of 'em and chances are.	O
I use them for a one time thing and I'm not going to use them again.	O
So why keep him act.	O
Alright are there any free fonts Toms asking free as in I'm not a creative cloud member?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I don't know, but if your credit card member.	CHITCHAT
You're using all of these as part of your membership so if you mean free free, meaning I can go use it as a nun.	O
Whatever I would say the only free ones would be the ones that might install with a trial or one that you install because you registered the credit card account.	O
I don't know of any free free ones.	CHITCHAT
Uhm OK, so with that, said let's see if I go remember what one of these was Lizza.	CHITCHAT
Display pro should now be active.	O
So I'll go back and look at that let's change this one, too.	O
Alyssa.	CHITCHAT
I spell this correctly.	CHITCHAT
Hang on.	CHITCHAT
There it is loser display display Pro is now active and I kind of like that.	O
Yeah, I'm not going to use that every day, but you like it and I probably did use it for one time thing OK and so great.	O
That's going to Deactivate 180 days.	O
Now I keep saying that it will prompt you if you open up something that you don't have the fonts for let me show you what I mean by that.	O
Let's go up and create a new document.	O
Let's get out of this first or we go new document.	O
And I'm going to go to the print category and I'm going to grab a template meaning.	O

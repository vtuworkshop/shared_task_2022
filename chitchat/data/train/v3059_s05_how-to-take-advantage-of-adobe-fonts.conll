I'm going to sink a free to use template that most likely has type in it, that I may or may not have the fonts for this.	O
Let's hopefully will pick one that we don't have a Ponce for let's download that one.	O
Yes, I'm sure.	CHITCHAT
It will download it at the speed of My Internet connection did I say that out.	CHITCHAT
There is downloading.	CHITCHAT
Now, almost done almost done almost done downloading downloading downloading.	CHITCHAT
Oh so Tom is asking what, if I create a document that uses a certain point.	CHITCHAT
What happens after 180 days.	CHITCHAT
That's exactly what I'm about to answer now, so let's say this brochure or whatever.	CHITCHAT
This is uses one of those fonts that I after 180 days got deactivated so let's double click on it now.	O
And as it opens this is what you would get so you would get the fact that.	CHITCHAT
Hey, I created a document 181 days ago that use one of those font packs and now the font pack got deactivated but I want to open a document use it.	O
This is what would happen, it would say Hey, you don't have agency faced or I was gonna say Facebook FB Lite?	O
Why'd you don't have Newberry Sands pro regular so resolve fonts, which means.	O
Even if you open up a document for fonts.	O
You've deactivated they would activate a pawn opening when you click the button.	O
And that way.	O
It just you just work so that's what we mean by you don't have to keep thousands of fonts active at a time because activate am USM.	O
You're not going to use them anytime soon again deactivate him.	O
If you ever do.	O
Open up a document that uses a more you need him again activate him again.	O
Now I'm not saying for the ones you.	O
Love and use all the time always keep those active or for the ones you use rarely that's the one you don't you don't have to worry about activating OK, so now I saw a question earlier.	O
I think it's time for me to answer answer.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I've installed a million fonts welcome to the club.	CHITCHAT
Alright so Gavins asking can I can I do an image?	CHITCHAT
Search for fonts and the answer is yes.	CHITCHAT
But I'm going to show you a cool way to do it in photo shop, so I'm going to open up a document.	O
Let me open up recently I wanted this one and open up a photo and in that photo.	O
There's an old bottle of film.	O
Dryer right allows for people that used to photograph with film.	O
Now the only thing in this photo shop file are 2 things.	O
The original image.	O
So it's an image layer and the word.	O
Agfa that I typed and I used whatever font.	O
I used I used minion pro bold condensed italic and obviously.	O
The minion pro bold attempts condensed italic that I used is not the agfa font.	O
It's not that font in the image what I want is to use a font that is either that font or certainly as close to it as I can get and that is the image search.	O
I think they're asking for afternoon.	CHITCHAT
Jesse and Steve Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Everybody on be hands.	CHITCHAT
ICU now over, there, so how would I do that, well photo shop and few versions back.	O
Few updates ago introduced a feature called match font.	O
So here's what I do.	CHITCHAT
I open up the image that has the type in it, that I like.	O
I just type some text that is probably the word.	O
I'm looking for us all know if it matches or not?	O
That's not a requirement you have to type the text.	O
But I do it for visual verification and then you stay on the text layer, so In other words, keep the text layer select it.	O
And you go your marquee tool so I'm just going to use my rectangular marquee.	O
I'll make a selection around the font that I want so again keep in mind.	O
That's just an image so I've made a selection around Agfa.	O
I have the agfa layer selected that I typed in whatever fonts in and then you go up to the tight menu and you choose match font.	O
So match font built into photo shop and what that simply says is I'm going to do my best to look through.	O
Your fonts the ones you have active.	O
An Adobe fonts that you don't have active yet to see if I can find one that either matches.	O
This or at least close to it because here's a reality when you're selecting an image.	O
It could have been something someone painted by hand.	O
It is no there is no font so sometimes it's going to look close button.	O
Sometimes it may not be close at all because it depends on what you're searching for so if it can find a font awesome.	O
They can find something close awesome, it might not find anything at all Oh well.	CHITCHAT
Depends on what it is you're searching for alright so match font and it here's the list of fonts it found so let's start with the Top here.	O

These are the fonts in order that it thinks I have that are close to that.	O
And here are the fonts.	O
I don't have synced yet that it thinks are close to that.	O
Now I've already done this already know which font it is.	O
It's the one that I've already synced but the way I found that font was, I synced it.	O
I didn't know which one it was going to be and as this abolition softsoap I just.	O
I don't mean to make it a favorite.	O
But if I click on that.	O
That is as close as I'm going to get to that old Agfa logo from back in the day so this is what I mean by it listed in order great that is the one I want click OK and it's already changed my type to match that as close as it can is it the exact font sometimes.	O
Not always 'cause again.	O
It depends on Adobe fonts are not unlimited, meaning there's not it's not every font in the world, so sometimes you're searching for something that just doesn't exist as a font.	O
I'll give you an example.	O
Let me open up another image.	O
And let's open up the.	CHITCHAT
This one.	CHITCHAT
Now this is literally neon this is a neon sign someone did by hand.	O
There is no font for this someone made this.	O
This is on an old building somewhere took a picture of it and I'm going to go ahead and grab my type tool.	O
I'm going to come up here and click and type, the word cafe.	O
And I'm going to do it in a different font.	O
Don't don't want to just so we can see it upper and lower case.	O
There we go and now I got the cafe typed.	O
And just bring it down so we can see it.	O
I'm now.	CHITCHAT
I want it to interfere OK.	O
Let's hear let's do this and make it a little smaller.	O
I don't want to interfere with my selection and we can even change the color of it, too.	O
To whatever that color is that white color there, we go OK.	O
So now I've got my cafe.	O
and I want photo shop to find whatever it can find that's at least close to that again.	O
I don't expect it to be perfect.	O
'cause that is something someone made by hand.	O
Alright so now grab my marquee tool.	O
I'll come up here and select my cafe.	O
And then we'll do our match font.	O
And it found the ones it thinks that I already have installed are like it and it found some that I don't already have synced that it thinks are like it so I can just go through clicking not really.	O
That's close that actually had subtle for that, but I keep trying maybe we found something better Nope.	O
Nope.	CHITCHAT
It's OK and then if I want to try one of these like this.	O
Quimby gubernatorial regular I can then click the sync icon.	O
It'll sink that font and then it will show me that font.	O
So you can sync even the ones that you don't have in place and it will show you what that one looks like I can see why you think that's it.	O
But that's not it.	O
So let's try.	O
The Next One and again.	O
I don't expect it to be a perfect match because if it's something someone drew by hand.	O
There isn't necessary isn't necessarily a font to match it.	O
Alright alright so I'm going to go back to which one do I want.	O
Not that one.	O
I'm thinking that one.	O
Yeah, if I were going to pick one to show my clients say, Hey, we couldn't find the exact one, but this is pretty close.	O
I probably picked out work.	O
Art and their young so again, you can now go and you could convert that to outlines.	O
You could manually go in with your pen tool and reshape it and redesign it and make a vector logo.	O
If you needed to, but that would be it.	O
Alright one more thing.	O
Let's go over to.	O
Someone show in in design, OK, so here we are in in design and I kind of showed you this already so let's say that we go in and we change.	O
This Italian restaurant.	O
Bella see nose that I just made up made up the name of it out.	O
I don't think there's a name of restaurant like that.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to go ahead.	CHITCHAT
An Indesign I'm going to just tell it to do.	O
Bickham script pro, which is one of my favorite fonts so Bickham Script Pro.	O
I just want to point out what you could do now, that you have this power, so this is a this is an Adobe font.	O
Bickham script pro.	O
It's one.	CHITCHAT
I've used for years, even before it was part of critical out and what I love about this font?	CHITCHAT
Is it has the most of any Phone.	O
I've ever seen alternate glyphs and why is this important because if I said to someone go make me a logo for a restaurant called Bella see nose and use Bickham Script Pro.	O

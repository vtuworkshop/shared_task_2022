Chances are I'm gonna get back this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to get back there, going to type the word Bellacino's.	O
They're going to choose Bickham Script Pro.	O
They're gonna make it a color and make it a size.	O
Whatever we get something similar to this.	O
But if you're a designer and you're trying to differentiate your work from someone else is even using the same fonts.	O
We all have then you could really get into the design of the logo by alter alternating glyphs for example, by highlight the B.	O
It's like.	CHITCHAT
The game show that you know.	CHITCHAT
Show me another be.	CHITCHAT
Show me be able to be so that one.	CHITCHAT
I like that one better OK great.	O
Show me an alternate S.	O
OK.	O
Oh hang on, I always forget, which one that is.	CHITCHAT
There we go there, we go.	CHITCHAT
Show me the alternate S is.	O
I kinda like that one.	CHITCHAT
Great.	CHITCHAT
Show me that one and maybe I'm going to take the E.	O
Show me the alternate ease.	O
I really, really tiny.	O
And maybe I like that, so now I'm getting something different than anyone else would just give me about give me the same type.	O
Same font same word.	O
Now, when it pops out like that.	O
Sometimes it is very tiny and hard to see so you and each one of these applications.	O
You can go in and you can bring up the alternate.	O
Or I'm sorry, the glyphs panel so if I go under type.	O
And I go to glyphs.	O
That should have brought up my glass panel somewhere, you know where is my glass panel?	O
Did I not get it type?	CHITCHAT
It's there why not seeing it, it might have popped it over here somewhere.	CHITCHAT
Hang on, sometimes it's tough shows up on another display or something I'm just not seeing it hold on.	CHITCHAT
There it is alright so there's my glass panel.	O
And if I bring up my glass panel an you highlight a character.	O
You can make this panel bigger and you can say don't.	O
Give me the entire font just show Maine, the alternates.	O
Which are?	CHITCHAT
Show.	O
Taller there we go.	O
Alternates for the selection there, we go and now I can say make this bigger there.	O
We go and show me the alternates for that selection, so I can see them bigger so with the glyphs panel.	O
You can get in and actually play around the individual characters and make your own your own design using type an alternate glyphs for font now again every font doesn't have alternate glyphs.	O
It is literally up to you.	CHITCHAT
Alright so with that, said, I hope that you got something out of today.	CHITCHAT
I hope that you will now one more thing I will just mention it to as well.	CHITCHAT
You should those fonts are available in your mobile apps see the fonts.	CHITCHAT
You've synced before that, as well.	CHITCHAT
Oppa, which pop up and design and probably.	CHITCHAT
You.	CHITCHAT

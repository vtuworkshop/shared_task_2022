Hello everyone welcome to this live stream.	CHITCHAT
Today I'm going to do and experimentation on the on something new draft learned and I've been experimenting with it for for a few days and I'm going to show you what I've done so far and then I'm going to show you what I'm going to work on so I'm going to start by showing some some examples, so first of all.	O
I just did this.	CHITCHAT
I just exported this render from cinema 4D.	O
And uh.	CHITCHAT
How's it.	O
Gonna see from if I go from one picture to another.	O
I exported it frame by frame.	O
So you can see the animation and I forgot to export it without a background so but it's still I think it's still going to work.	CHITCHAT
So the experimenting that I've been doing is just getting 1 frame from from this from this animation edited in Photoshop.	O
And then uh.	CHITCHAT
Out put it in this software.	O
The Simpsons are not pronounce it but yeah, and based on one frame.	O
It is going to animate the whole the whole thing, so I tested it by just applying one.	O
By applying some effects on this picture.	O
And I'm going to show you so.	O
Here's the original picture supplied some some.	O
There is just to see if it would work and based on that softwares so here's the.	O
Be sure the key frame.	CHITCHAT
So here's the key frame.	O
Yeah, I just did this as a test and based on that the output with this one.	O
So if I move from one picture to another to another you can see that.	O
It generates everything by itself, so I said, This is just a test that I did before I start the live stream just to see if this would work because as I said, I didn't export it with a transparent background.	O
I just notice notice it when the render was finished, so I'm going to show you another.	O
Another experiment that I've done that is much better.	O
Yeah, so basically I had this exported this from Cinema 4D and I'm going from one image to another as you can see right here, so you can kind of see the animation.	O
And you can see that I'm going from one picture to another and.	O
Yeah, just as you can see, there are 129 frames and from that, I edit it just one frame.	O
So the key frame right here.	O
So this is the edit that I made.	O
Using.	CHITCHAT
Using Photoshop, This is from cinema 4D this is the edit and based on that the software.	O
Yeah, this software generated all the other frames so I'm going to show you how it looks.	O
Sorry for making a mess right here, but yeah, crazy output.	CHITCHAT
So based on this frames, it generates all the other frames.	O
Yeah, as you can see it has a really good result as you can see right here.	O
There are some some glitches stuff.	O
But since it is a kind of abstract animation.	O
It still looks good and I can also add some frame by frame animations to it to make it look better.	O
But yeah, this is how it works.	O
Yeah, just to show you how it works, and now I'm going to work on one of the the frames so.	O
Like to delete this because I said, this was just for a test.	O
Exit this.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, here all the.	O
Key frames and I think I'm going to add it just one so the first one.	O

Or maybe?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think the first one, is OK.	O
So I don't know if I should remove the background.	O
Because all the other frames have have the background.	O
So I think I'm just going to edit it as it is, and I don't have a clear idea of what I'm going to do, but	O
As always, I start by working with the adjustments.	O
And by the way if you will have any questions, you can just use the chat so first of all I'm going to start the tool timeline.	O
K.	CHITCHAT
And Yeah, just work with the adjustments 1st.	O
And I think I'm just going to select some of these polygons and apply some textures on each of them.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Also, maybe I can apply some filters.	O
And if you have any suggestions.	CHITCHAT
You can just let me know because.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure what?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do to this picture because I'm also testing this as you can see the render is not.	O
In high quality.	O
I didn't want to spend too much time waiting for the render is why I exported it.	O
In a low.	O
Quality just like an added 1 frame in Photoshop and then.	O
And then see how it how it looks.	CHITCHAT
Hello Hello Junior Santana Hello.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so now that I added these adjustments.	O
I think I'm going to copy the whole thing and paste it by using control shift C and Control V.	O
And uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's see what other adjustments, I can use.	O
The one that I usually use.	O
Like the posture eyes and oil paint facts.	O
OK, I think it looks really nice with that.	CHITCHAT
I'll just click OK.	O
I'm going to make a copy of it again.	O
I'm making copies of the of the pictures just so I can have the old version, just in case I don't like the new version by the way I'm going to exit these.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm thinking too.	CHITCHAT
To apply some textures, so I'm going to open.	O
Cam going to open some patterns, maybe like this one that I usually use with a black and White Stripes.	O
K.	CHITCHAT
Something to copy that.	O
Pasted and now I need to select the shapes where I want to apply that pattern so.	O
Maybe I can select just one color like the pink color so I'll just go to select color range.	O
Yeah, just apply just selected that pink color and now I can play around with Busyness.	O
Basically, what it does is just.	CHITCHAT
Like if I decrease the busyness it will select exactly the color that I select right here.	O
If I increase the fuzziness.	O
It will select colors that are similar to the color.	O
I'm selecting so it increases the range of the colour others select.	O

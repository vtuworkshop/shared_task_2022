Just choose something like that here, the white color represents the colors that are selected from the picture.	O
So I'll just copy.	O
So here they are selected I'll just click control C to B and.	O
I'm going to invite it just so I can see that I selected OK by clicking CTRL R.	O
And uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, now here's the next layer that is about these selections right click control T.	O
K.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to apply that pattern to the layer below so to do that.	O
I just need to go to layer create clipping mask.	O
And now here it is applied.	O
I'm the Yeah, maybe I can apply that to some other shapes 2.	O
So I can select maybe these dark colors.	O
Control C Control V and I'm clicking invert just to make sure that they are selected.	O
And I'm going to make a copy of this texture by holding alt key and dragging down.	O
So I'll go to layer create clipping mask when I click create clipping mask.	O
I need to be sure that the layer where I want to apply the pattern to his below so in this case, it's right here and I'm sorry.	O
I never renamed the layers so.	O
Yeah, I guess.	CHITCHAT
You can understand that here is the selection is the pattern.	O
Here's the other selection there's a pattern.	O
So right now, you can see that the pattern is black and white but it it is applied.	O
On a part of the picture where the color is is dark, so I want the picture to make more sense or?	O
I'm going to make this darker, so do that I can just click control you and increase the lightness.	O
Click OK but if I want to change that later if I click control.	O
you and I increase the lightness.	O
It doesn't look good, so to avoid that.	O
I'm going to undo what I did, and I'm going to go to these adjustment players got you separation.	O
And increase the lightness from here.	O
As you can see the facts the whole picture.	O
I wanted to affect only the pattern below so again go to layer create clipping mask.	O
And uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, now now if I if I change.	O
My mind, and I want to make this darker.	O
I can just go to this adjustment layer click on it, and just stick with lightness if I want to add some colors, I can go to color eyes.	O
And the decrease lightness.	O
Change the color.	O
Whatever you would like to do so I think I'm going to keep it.	O
As a dark Gray.	O
And I think I'm going to keep selecting.	O
Selecting shapes.	O
And applying textures, so I'm going to see what I can use as a texture next.	O
I'm going to Scroll down and.	O
Just fine.	CHITCHAT
Something that I like I always use this.	CHITCHAT
This one is a texture.	O
Just going to do some adjustments.	O
Or I use that?	CHITCHAT
So go to filter and liquefy because I want to fill this dark space right here.	O
So I'm just going to drag it, I'll click OK.	O
And I'm going to copy it again and let's go to the main layer to the main document where I'm working out.	O
And by the way if you will have any questions, you can just use the chat and let you know so.	CHITCHAT
OK, now let's select another color.	O
I'm going to select this red.	O
Other soldiers go to select color range select it and I'm going to play around with the fuzziness.	O
Yeah, I'll click OK.	O
Control C Control V.	O
Yeah, I have selected it.	O
And Uh Yeah, now I have to copy this again.	O
And paste it, I'm making sure that I've pasted it above the.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Shapes I just selected these shapes.	O
Friend.	CHITCHAT
All this texture.	O

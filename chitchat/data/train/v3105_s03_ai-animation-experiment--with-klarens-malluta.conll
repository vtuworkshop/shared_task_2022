An go to layer create clipping mask, meaning that applying the.	O
The texture on the layer below.	O
And again if I don't like the colors, I can just go to.	O
Consideration.	CHITCHAT
And I wanted to apply to be applied only to layers below so I'll go to later create favorite mask.	O
And I think I'm going to apply this texture again because I like the way it looks so.	O
I don't like the green color.	O
So I'm just going to.	O
Select it again select color range and you just take the green color.	O
Going to increase the fuzziness.	O
So I pick all the shades of green color.	O
I'll click OK control C Control V.	O
Yeah, even if I just inverted it still looks looks nice.	O
But I think I'm going to use the.	O
Pattern so I'm going to just hold alt key and drag it down.	O
Going to use layer great sleeping mask.	O
Yeah, I'm going to also drag this, you separation or it above and I'm going to change it because I don't want it to be the same as the previous one.	O
OK, so I don't know what else I can add maybe.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to copy the whole thing.	O
And paste it?	O
Hey oil paint, yeah, I know that I don't know.	O
In some Photoshop versions.	O
Maybe doesn't work.	O
I also have a friend who he said the same thing, but	CHITCHAT
I think there are some tutorials that explain how you can achieve that effect or a similar affected by combining some.	CHITCHAT
Some different tools, so they don't have the oil pain, but you can still achieve that effect by combining some different tools.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
How you can do that?	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just searching up search it on YouTube and I think you will find something.	CHITCHAT
And now I'm going to apply some.	O
Some filters.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
It looks good, but I'm going to show you what I'm why I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
This fact in a few.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm going to change my mind because.	CHITCHAT
It is not looking good.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it doesn't look good because.	O
It doesn't have a transparent background.	O
But if I had a transparent background, I think.	O
Some some adjustments.	O
Yeah, I'm sure you will find something because, as I said.	CHITCHAT
One of my friends had the same problem and he said that he found the solution somewhere on YouTube so.	CHITCHAT
OK so now I'm thinking.	O
I should apply any other effects.	O
Yeah, I guess I'll just leave it as is for now or maybe I can.	O
Create a new layer go select color range.	O
Case all.	O

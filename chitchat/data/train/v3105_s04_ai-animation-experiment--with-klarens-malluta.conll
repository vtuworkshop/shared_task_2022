I'm going to to explain.	CHITCHAT
What I'm going to do because I don't know if anyone was watching some from the beginning so?	CHITCHAT
Going to open the folder basically I have this.	O
This animation driver exported from cinema party.	O
I've exported it frame by frame and I remember to check the Alpha Channel.	O
So it also has the background.	O
That yes, you can see if I'm moving from one picture to another it does this animation.	O
And uh.	CHITCHAT
I'm using I just found actually this.	O
This software.	O
And basically what it does is just.	O
Like convert the whole.	O
Video in Like if you can get just a just a frame from the whole video and put it in this software.	O
It will apply that effect on all the frames and I showed you an example before.	O
So I had this animation frame by frame.	O
And I edited just this frame on photo shop, so it is called the keyframe so this is how I edited in Photoshop and when I put it on the software.	O
I got this result, so it applied the same effect on all the other frames.	O
Although the the faces is moving a little bit and it has some distortions, but the overall video looks looks good in my opinion.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Now I just did some I did I applied some attacks on one of the frames and I'm going to export it so we save us.	O
And it's fine.	O
I think it should be the same.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to replace this because I did it this just as past.	O
Going to click OK.	O
I'm going to open this software.	O
OK, I'm going to put the video right here.	O
Also, there is the key frame.	O
That should be somewhere here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put it on the key frame.	O
And right here, I'm going to.	O
Say that it starts from zero and the key frame that I edited was the first one, so it will be 0 and the last keyframe is 9.	O
So that's it, I just need to pick.	O
This option right here and I need to wait until until it finishes the process.	O
And it is going to export it right here, so it just exported the first one.	O
And I need to wait for for all of that, so I know this takes some time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can see it exported the second one, too because they are similar.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know if I should add the and the live stream.	CHITCHAT
Right now, I'm just.	CHITCHAT
Just wait until this finishes so I can show you the result.	CHITCHAT
OK, so as you can see it starts.	CHITCHAT
It is starting to do some animations right here.	O
So I think while we wait.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can teach you something on photo shop.	CHITCHAT
So I don't know if you want me to teach you something just let me know if you want to know any specific effects and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT

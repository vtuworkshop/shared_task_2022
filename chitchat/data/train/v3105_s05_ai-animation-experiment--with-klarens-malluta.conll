For this output tool finished as you can see it just doing some progress.	O
Yeah, while we wait for that.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to show you how to create some some abstract backgrounds and if you want to learn.	CHITCHAT
Something more specific just let me know this is just the idea that I had in mind right now, so for example, the first thing that you notice.	CHITCHAT
I think it's the.	CHITCHAT
Is that quality?	CHITCHAT
So going to make copy of this is always and going to use the authorized effect.	O
I'll click OK.	O
Now it makes it look more like a cartoon.	O
And again to make the better is the oil paint, it always looks nice with oil paint and.	O
Something else that you can do is just make a copy of it.	O
I'll go to filter filter Gallery.	O
I'm going to use this paint dumps.	O
And as you can see right here, you have the brush size in the sharpness.	O
I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, increase this to make it look like like this.	O
And the brush type I used this sparkle going to click OK.	O
And again, I'm going to use the authorized effect.	O
I'll click OK and now go again to filter Gallery.	O
And as you can see right now, it shows these lines that I think they look really cool.	O
Some can I can increase the sharpness?	O
So they can look better.	O
And I'm going to click OK.	O
And now something else we can do to this picture to make it.	O
The better is select some areas.	O
I can go to select color range.	O

I'll click OK and create a new layer.	O

And let's see.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm going to use this gradient strap created myself by having a another picture as a reference.	O
And Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Is that some really nice details to the picture?	O
So again.	O
I'm choosing to select some other colors.	O
Yeah, I'm just going to keep choosing colors.	O

Let's see the progress that we have made so far on this one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK, we're still making progress so let's wait.	O
And yeah, I think it looks nice.	CHITCHAT
Until now, but if I zoom in you can see that these outlines are kind of pixelated whenever I have, I faced this problem?	O
And guess the filter that I use.	O
The whole thing and.	O
Just use the oil paint.	O
Anime click OK and if I submit now you can see the difference.	O
Yeah, it looks much better.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Basically, we went from this.	O
Is this image to this image so I was just image?	O
And I applied a facts straight to make it look like this.	O
And uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I can keep editing this by adding more efx so I'm going to merge groups.	O
I can have it as a one there.	O
I'm Yeah, I'm going to distort it more.	O
I can do something like this.	CHITCHAT
I think there is also another.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this smaller ordinates.	O
I usually like this power to rectangular.	O
Yes, you can see it's grace also some really cool.	O
Results and yeah, something else like all these are kind of effects to make it look more WAVY for example, that the wave.	O
Can increase the number of generators?	O
And you can see the preview right here.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Undo and the effect that I wanted to show you it's called the wind effect.	O
Open photo shop again.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's under Stylize went also I want to try this trace contour.	O
Yeah, this one is nice, too.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I wanted to try the.	O
The wind effect.	O
So as you can see, there are 3 options.	O
I'm going to.	O
Show them all.	O
Just so you can see the difference, I'm going to make copy 1st.	O
Side note, Filter Stylize and go to wind affect and.	O
Yeah, just click OK on the wind.	O
And if you want to apply the same effect.	O
You can go to filter and you have it right here.	O
The last filter that you used or you can use the shortcut alt control app.	O
So you can see that still does.	CHITCHAT
That kind of fact I think it looks really cool.	CHITCHAT
So that's the difference.	O
OK, so make another copy.	O
Now go to stylize wind.	O
And go to Class I'll just click OK.	O
And I can use the same pattern over and over.	O
And you can see the difference between those two wind effects.	O

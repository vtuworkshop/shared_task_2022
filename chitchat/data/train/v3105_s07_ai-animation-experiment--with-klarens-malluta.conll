I think this one looks better.	O
Going to make another copy so I can use the other.	O
The other option.	O
So God filter stylize go to wind.	O
And us this stagger and also you can see that there is the.	O
Direction so it is from the right and from the left.	O
Just use the same option from the right.	O
OK and usually this one is my favorite.	O
It creates a really cool glitchy effect.	O
See I'm just thinking, Alt Control F.	O
Yeah, and I'm holding shift so I can distort it just and this is actually just for the latest version of Photoshop.	O
Because Uh Yonder on the previous version.	O
You would have you don't need to hold shift?	O
So distorted you would need to hold.	O
Shipped out keep the proportions while on the latest version of photo shop is the opposite.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think I don't like this one, so I'll just delete it.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe I can invert it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I just click control, I or maybe I can go to adjustments.	O
I click invert.	O
And can you separation?	O
And in case you don't like the colors.	O
Out always always suggest to use the gradient map.	O
So I can go to gradient map and just pick.	O
One of the gradients that I've selected that I've created before.	O
OK can also reverse colors, I think this one looks nicer.	O
I can also change the mold.	O
The blending mode.	O
For example, this one looks better the light and want the screen one.	O
I'm going to prove it.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, basically I just wanted to show you that you have a lot of facts that you can use on on photo shop to create.	O
Create different backgrounds and.	O
Yeah, just to experiment with with the tools.	O
Basically, I just use this one to do this kind of background also this one this one and this one.	O
You can use them for various objects and you can keep experimenting with them.	O
So like I can make a copy of this and I can still go to something like liquified.	O
Yeah, just.	CHITCHAT
Just drag it.	O
But I think the yeah, the liquify tool is kind of old fashion right now.	O
I think it is to be cool, one hour chasm.	CHITCHAT
Used to use it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think now everyone is using it so.	CHITCHAT
But anyway, you can do this kind of.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of diagonal lines.	CHITCHAT

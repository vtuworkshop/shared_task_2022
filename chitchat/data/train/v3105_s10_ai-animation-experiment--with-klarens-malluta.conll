Yes.	CHITCHAT
Animation that I exported from cinema 4D here all the frames and I wanted to apply some effects to it.	O
So I just added.	O
This frame the 1st frame so this is the original one.	O
And this is a key frame so the first.	O
The 1st frame that I edited and based on that I put it on the software that I showed you and it generates by itself.	O
All the other frames as you can see right here.	O
So on this live stream, I did the same thing with the.	O
With an animation that I exported from.	O
Cinema 4D.	O
So here is the.	O
The original The original animation all the frames of it and.	O
Here is the added that I did on the 1st frame and based on that.	O
The software that I showed you before generating all the frames and I'm going to show you.	O
Looks like.	CHITCHAT
And I hope it doesn't crash so I'll just click on one frame as you can see right here on the sequence options have checked the sequence so.	O
So I can get all the other phrase by southwood click import and I'm just going to put it on a new position.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yes, you can see it does it has generated all the other.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Frames by itself, and as I said earlier.	O
I exported the image with the background by mistake.	O
I want it to be a transparent background.	O
But I didn't notice that I hadn't checked the Alpha Channel, but anyway, I just wanted to test this and see how it looks.	O
And yeah now.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can apply some other adjustments here.	O
For example, I always had some glow.	O
To the animations that I do?	O
So yeah, I used this glow from the software plug-in.	O
Yes, I can keep editing this on.	O
I don't know on after effects.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Hello Hello, Christina, OK so I don't know if you have any opinions about this just just let me know.	CHITCHAT
And uh if you want you can test it yourself and see what results you can get.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Change the Camera movements at Google to something else.	O
But anyway, now I'm going to exit this.	O
And uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that's it for this ice cream.	CHITCHAT
Basically, I got the.	O
Original.	CHITCHAT
The original frame from the animation an edited them in photo shop.	O
This is how it was this how I edited it and uh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I did I just said it 1 frame and with the software it generated all the other frames by kind of applying the same effects.	O
And I think I'm going to test this again and maybe add some more facts.	O

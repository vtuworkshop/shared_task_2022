A couple things I mentioned before my I realize my mic was muted.	CHITCHAT
Um we're going to cover today.	O
Mostly the basics of pixel art.	O
We're not going to get into the details of depth Maps animation.	O
I'm making a note of things were not going to do today.	CHITCHAT
Um complex characters.	O
A really intricate works with perspective and and like Pseudo, 3D effects now that's going to be covered.	O
We're going to come.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I also need to state again.	CHITCHAT
I'm not a pro.	CHITCHAT
I don't know all the in's and outs of pixel or I don't know what makes good pixel art or bad pixel art.	CHITCHAT
I have not made any AAA games or even AA games with pixel art in them.	CHITCHAT
I've done.	CHITCHAT
None of those things.	CHITCHAT
But I like to do pixel art.	CHITCHAT
I think it's fun.	CHITCHAT
I like the way it looks and I know a little bit about it now there's a lot of people who know a lot more than I do and a lot of people who know a lot less than I do so.	CHITCHAT
I'm kind of an interesting middle ground.	CHITCHAT
And uh hopefully at the very least what I have to share with you all today will be useful and maybe even help you become a better pixel artist yourself.	CHITCHAT
I had noted that some of you may have done pixel art in the past, maybe like through online pixel art programs.	CHITCHAT
Perhaps paint when you were a kid.	CHITCHAT
I know for me.	CHITCHAT
We had computer labs at the school that I attended that would get to go to every so often an whenever I have the opportunity.	CHITCHAT
I'd open paint up and have a go.	CHITCHAT
But none of it was very good, I was a child.	CHITCHAT
You know, and pains not the greatest tool to make pixel art in now.	CHITCHAT
Some would probably play Devil's advocate and make pixel art in paint almost Despite that statement they would say.	CHITCHAT
Any tools that is a good tool if the artist is good enough.	CHITCHAT
And while that can be true, it's also just super not enjoyable to work in paint So what I'm going to do today is I'm going to cover the topics of how to set up your document?	O
What types of tools.	CHITCHAT
You should be using and maybe just maybe we'll look into some interesting affects like gradients.	O
Maybe possibly animation.	O
I know I said no animation earlier, but maybe simple animation, not too bad to do in photo shop.	O
And also I might.	CHITCHAT
I might get into some normal Maps because they're not easy to make.	O
Well, it's easy to make them just not necessarily good ones, and normal Maps are basically just a way to get a Pseudo 3D effect on your pixel art.	O
And I've actually got a game that I made a while back that could possibly display that but it's not a very good game, and at the example might be poor.	CHITCHAT
But That being said, We're going to hop into it.	CHITCHAT
We're not going to do perspective we're not going to do 3D stuff.	CHITCHAT
We're not going to do anything difficult today.	CHITCHAT
We're going to focus on the core aspects of it.	CHITCHAT
We've only got another 50 minutes now 'cause I've been talking for about 10 of those already.	CHITCHAT
But I'll try to get as much in as I can that I think is going to be useful.	CHITCHAT
And there's a lot there's a lot to pixel art so strapped in.	CHITCHAT
I didn't have a plan today.	CHITCHAT
Uh this was actually kind of a last minute thought and you can, especially tell that because my pen.	CHITCHAT
Instead, you could tell that I didn't prepare for this at all.	CHITCHAT
But what I plan to do is maybe make this into a little series of maybe 3 or 4 streams.	CHITCHAT
Uh I don't know how much I can actually get.	CHITCHAT
Into one of these streams.	CHITCHAT
Like based around my skill.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I could really come up with multiple streams worth of pixel art video, but I'll do my best.	CHITCHAT
Alright Oh, there's no music playing either.	CHITCHAT
I was trying to change my sound settings last night and it just completely ruined.	CHITCHAT
There we go it completely ruined all my sound settings.	CHITCHAT
So where I think we're back to normal now fantastic.	CHITCHAT
Alright so.	CHITCHAT
At the very beginning.	O
When you open up photo shop now.	O
This isn't limited just to Photoshop.	O
This is kind of a broad set up stage.	O
Basically, you're going to make a new document.	O
We're all familiar with that every program you need to make a new document.	O
And when you're doing that.	O
The dimensions for pixel art don't really matter.	O
Now there there.	CHITCHAT
There is the possibility that you make a normal size canvas like a 8 1/2.	O
By 11 or something and it is gigantic an what you can do is zoom as closely as possible and make your pixel art there.	O
That's totally valid.	O
I wouldn't recommend it, especially if you want to make pixel art.	O
With the purpose like if you want to make a spreadsheet or if you want to like make a like a landscape at your character will exist in or maybe make a tile set.	O

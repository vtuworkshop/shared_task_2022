Making a huge canvas isn't really ideal for that what I like to do personally is since I'm mostly make my pixel are based around a game.	O
I'll start with a 1920 by 1080 and you know cut that in half or cut that down.	O
By 3/4 to get something close to let's see what I'm working at now working at 640 by 480.	O
That's typically where I'll start personally because pixel art doesn't need to be 1080P 'cause you can scale it up.	O
Better the fewer pixels that has.	O
Typically, the better it is, and that kind of you know it varies if you want to make like a minimalistic game.	O
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
But I think that the more you can make it look good with this few pixels as possible, the better off you tend to be there's definitely a place in the world for a larger pixel art like shriek fighter stuff.	O
What other games incorporate that like Fire Emblem kind of does that too well they'll have like fairly large characters and you can tend to you can tend to see the small pixels, but it's often like.	O
Very.	CHITCHAT
Very uh.	CHITCHAT
Detailed pixel art this isn't a good example.	O
But you know like there might be like and I hear you know, and they really spend the time to make it look like it just a small illustration and there's a place for that definitely, but I tend to prefer pixel art.	O
That's really on the pixel level or you'll get.	O
You know you'll see the pixels like this.	O
Games like Mario link to the past.	O
Those older classic games.	O
That's what I tend to prefer to do.	O
But I will try to delve into the more detailed stuff at some point but for now, we'll just stick with the basics so.	O
One thing I personally like to do is establish a well, I guess I'm jumping ahead of myself a little bit here.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to talking about the tools.	O
So what I'm doing here is I've got this pencil tool, it's just the pencil tool here on the left hand side.	O
I guess it would help if I turn the tool timeline on so you can see what I'm using.	O
And the biggest feature of the pencil tool is its lack of anti aliasing and some of you may be aware of what anti aliasing is or have heard the phrase before basically all that really means to simplify it is the grave fuzzies on the side of your line there and what that is kind of like a like a dithering or a smoothing to make your lines look a little bit more flowy an organic.	O
And we're doing pixel art you absolutely do not want that and a lot of times game engines will have options to turn on antialiasing or turn them off usually it's on by default in my experience, but you want to make sure that if you're not a game.	O
Dev if you're not on the dev side you don't need to worry about that at all.	O
You don't need to worry about any engine stuff.	O
You just need to focus on your pixel job.	O
But you will not get good results with a brush like this, some people might.	O
Might use this type of brush while they're making pixel art for aesthetic reasons, but there's a lot of argument over what pixel art actually is or what it's true pixel or I'm not going to talk about any of that today.	O
But there's definitely some controversy to it, and even if we get the hardest brush at the smallest size.	O
You're still going to get anti aliasing and we definitely don't want that again.	O
So if you go to the pencil tool if you hold shift and press B.	O
You can toggle between your brush types, So what I've done is I've gone to the brush.	O
I hold shift press B and it goes over the pencil tool.	O
And with this, you can get really sharp lines.	O
And you won't get any anti aliasing at all, so there's that for you.	O
That's the beginning.	O
I tend to prefer to work at a one pixel size.	O
You can of course, make this bigger if you want to.	O
But this we're kind of delving more into the like properly detailed drawn out, pixel art, which I don't really want to do today?	O
So we won't do that.	O
Same thing could be applied to your your eraser tool actually.	O
Just make like a?	CHITCHAT
Just make a little boat here for now, just as a placeholder.	O
That's that that's what both look like perfect so say you want to.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Erase the mass from behind here.	O
So you got you racer.	O
But it's still like it's making your lines all fuzzy.	O
It's an seeing your aliases well.	O
There's a little little guy appeared called mode.	O

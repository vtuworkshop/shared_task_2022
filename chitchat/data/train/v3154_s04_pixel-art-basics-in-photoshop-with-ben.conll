An shift G to open up the gradient tool will just grab that color there and just drag it across.	O
That must be a new thing with the current version of Photoshop 'cause typically it.	O
It won't make a smooth gradient at this resolution what's going on here.	O
Am I had a bigger pixel size and I think I am I might be you know.	O
Wow, that's that's weird.	CHITCHAT
I've not made pixel are in Photoshop 2020 yet so.	CHITCHAT
Maybe something's changed there's like this dealer option, which should.	CHITCHAT
Change that, but yeah, we're getting like annoyingly smooth gradients here, which normally don't happen typically you'll get a much more aggressive dither.	O
I guess we can just shorten that up a little bit, yeah.	O
Let's see if there's any options in here this might be something I have to look into.	CHITCHAT
Later on.	CHITCHAT
I might have to get back to you guys on this one.	CHITCHAT
I think they change the way the gradient tool works.	CHITCHAT
Does anybody know?	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll have to get back to you guys on how that works because it's not working the same way.	CHITCHAT
I remember this is a much cleaner gradient than I was expecting, especially at such a small pixel resolution so.	O
Those are.	CHITCHAT
That's unusual OK, but one thing you can do, which is kind of handy is I made this particular effect in an animation a number of months ago.	CHITCHAT
And what I had done is let's see exactly how that works.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if I can find that and bring it in because it was a pretty cool animation.	CHITCHAT
Give me just a second I'll try to find this.	CHITCHAT
I promise next time I do this.	CHITCHAT
I'll spend more time to actually prepare because I'm really good at not doing that.	CHITCHAT
Also really bad at organizing my files to.	CHITCHAT
I don't notice how bad.	CHITCHAT
I am until I'm trying to find something.	CHITCHAT
Well, it's actually more in the animation category anyways, so let's not worry about that.	CHITCHAT
For now, things that you can do, which are cool, though, is say we've got this guy and will just make him totally blew again.	CHITCHAT
How does that sound?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Will give him some shading?	O
Just a little bit something very simple.	O
I will give him some highlights 2 things I don't really want to spend too long working on.	O
I know this is incredibly ugly, but will get to making prettier stuff in the future, I promise.	CHITCHAT
Something that's not so terrifying it really is kind of scary will make a new adjustment layer on Top.	O
And with this we can change the pixel art in real time, so it's really handy for making quick adjustments.	CHITCHAT
And say that I don't like these colors, one bit.	CHITCHAT
Go to Hue saturation just slide.	O
Those guys around and now we got our red guy and it's just incredibly easy to do.	O
Stuff like it.	CHITCHAT
Normally things like I've not actually used it.	CHITCHAT
So I can't really say for sure, but programs like.	O
A Sprite I don't think really can do this kind of thing just getting on the fly fixes and changes, which is incredibly helpful for making spreadsheets, making changes to spreadsheets later in the process.	O
Say for example, you had a whole series of Sprites of this guy going into a blink.	O
And you wanted, it to be actually green instead and you don't have to go back and change everything.	O
After the fact you can just change it in real time and you can even get variations much quicker too.	O
Say we're not really certain if we like the way this character looks.	CHITCHAT
There we go a little blink animation there.	O
So we can make a new layer here we could just hold alt shift and drag to make a new.	O
Copy of that and these are on 2 different layers, so will make one Hue saturation on Top and will make 1 below as well.	O

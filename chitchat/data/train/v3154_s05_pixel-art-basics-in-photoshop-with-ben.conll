If you will alt and click between the two you can make it clipping layers to only effects that one.	O
And here we can make him a little bit more orange or make him a little bit more back to blue.	O
I guess you can make those changes incredibly fast and it's again something I don't really think you can do with programs like a Sprite, especially not with paint so that's incredibly helpful to do that.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
What other types of things are layers are super helpful this as well so?	CHITCHAT
I think some people might jump in doing pixel art just straight ahead.	CHITCHAT
I know a lot of times.	CHITCHAT
I'll do that myself.	CHITCHAT
I'll get a bit of a sketch blocked out that I like and just go from there.	CHITCHAT
And while that's fine.	CHITCHAT
It does get a little bit messy, so what's kind of nice to do is maybe use your sketch as a base layer sure, but make a new layer on Top of that and start grabbing some I know a lot of people do this for animation specifically go grab a blocked color and they use that to represent certain body parts all on separate layers for the most part because it is much more helpful to keep track of and also positioning them.	O
Based on their depth, too, so for example, will have a?	O
Upper arm front here, which is not the correct one.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
So we have upper arm front and we have.	O
Lower arm front now this is a little bit more on the puppeteering type of mindset, which is totally fine, but	O
Just to let you guys know how I'm going about labeling.	O
These and this will be.	O
Upper arm back so you want to keep your layers in track like this and even if you want you can go as far as putting an anchor point down so you can freely rotate.	O
These parts to get a very dynamic rig.	O
I guess I would call it in this case.	CHITCHAT
And using just similar colors to indicate which part switch and now you get a much more free flowing more easy to animate and pose.	O
Foundation I guess I would call it and I'm going to put these upper and lower arms behind or below.	O
I guess the layers of the foreground arms because now you can see that they're going to be.	O
Correctly placed on their Z axis.	O
The coming forwards and backwards access and then between those we can put our chest layer here, which I'll make this nice blue color.	O
And here we won't have any interruptions for the line art at all looks at that supposed to and it's a lot easier to keep the foundation of and if you want to go as far as actually posing your animations with this foundation and the drawing over Top which again I've seen people do.	O
Especially for detailed pixel art this is totally an option for you and.	O
I'll call this just here.	O
And ultimately you will have it all flat and at the end of the day so you would probably come in later with your details and actually block in some proper stuff here and this is.	O
The kind of pixel are I tend not to do this tight detail work.	O
But this is something that you're able to do with this setup.	O
All right.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to keep track of it all, we got plenty of time.	CHITCHAT
Perfect I might even start a piece later.	CHITCHAT
I actually had something in mind that I wanted to work on, but I wanted to share with you all first basically some of the.	CHITCHAT
Core set up parts of making pixel art yourself if there are any questions at all by all means share them with me because I would love to know where you guys tend to stand pixel art experience wise and if there's anything that you don't know about that I can maybe shed some light on I'd love to do that.	CHITCHAT
A few things I do want to get into before we totally rap up with the intro stage.	CHITCHAT
Is the gradient Maps because Grady Maps are super cool an I found them to be surprisingly fascinating with making pixel are animations and I don't really want to get into the animation category.	O
Just yet, but I think for this specific thing.	CHITCHAT
For this specific idea I'll share it with you because this I think opens up a lot of possibilities.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start very simply.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have a reasonably grayish rectangle and inside of this rectangle.	O

I'm just going to kind of get some shapes going now.	O
I'm kind of biased to this lava lamp look.	CHITCHAT
Of like having this, this group kind of going on here.	CHITCHAT
These goofy shapes and I think this will all make more sense to you.	CHITCHAT
Once I actually get finished with this, but Start which is that now one thing I like to do is make my textures loop So what I'm going to do is duplicate this.	O
And I'm going to look to see where.	O
These edges begin and start just kind of chip away here chip away there.	O
Luckily, pixel art is pretty easy to loop in tile because it's so simple.	O
Such simple art.	CHITCHAT
Ironically, I kind of messed up with that I was painting on the wrong layer.	O
But you can see here very easily how to make these 2 loops these 2 shapes looped together.	O
What is grava this Gray here bring that out a little bit bring that out a little bit and we're done it loops perfectly now.	O
If we were to have it tiled vertically.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'm being a little bit vague here and type, you still don't know what my plan is and I like that.	CHITCHAT
You don't know what my plan is here because it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
I think will duplicate this a couple of times.	O
And we're going to merge all these together.	O
And then what I'm going to do is open up the window timeline.	O
And I'll create a new video timeline here Anna knowingly photo shops, layered default links are about five seconds, which is far too long for what I want to do here will make an animation that's about a second long.	O
And I want this to loop perfectly.	O
So duplicate that.	O
And let's actually just have these down will make them last for 15 seconds each.	O
There we go.	O
That's 15 frames rather and what I'm going to do here.	O
Is?	CHITCHAT
Let's see actually I don't think I want to duplicate this do it.	O
What I'm gonna do is I'm going to make a key frame which can be done by?	O
Dropping down your little little tab here.	O
This isn't really pixel art related.	O
You would often probably do this in a in Enjun.	O
But for the sake of the fun.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make it in here.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to set a new position here.	O
I'm going to go to the end of my.	O
Of my frame.	O
And make a secondary key frame and I might have to back up by a layer.	O
Whoops.	CHITCHAT
How do you do it is it?	CHITCHAT
I don't remember how to go back and forth between I don't think I've animated in Photoshop 2020.	CHITCHAT
Still, I don't know what any of these key frames are these key key short keys short cuts.	CHITCHAT
Alright so now that we have this what I need to do is move this by the length.	O
I kind of messed this up to tonight.	CHITCHAT
I want to move it by the length of an individual rectangle, but I think we can get away with something a little bit loosen rough.	O
This is mostly for experimentation.	CHITCHAT
Just to show you guys what you can do so to show you what you can do is going to move this down right about here and you can see if we go back in time.	O
We can see that this thing moves vertically based on the key frames.	O
Animation is a whole thing of its own.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to talk about it, too much today.	CHITCHAT
But if you have any interest in animating in photo shop?	CHITCHAT
I'll do my best.	CHITCHAT
But I would not usually use keyframes in photo shop.	O
I would save that for after effects.	O
It's a little bit better over there, but now, what we can do is since we have this shape.	O
That's moving hopefully relatively smoothly.	O
I know it's a little bit rough and jerky right now.	O
But hopefully once we add these new things over Top it'll make a little bit more sense.	O
Next up?	CHITCHAT
What I'm going to do is like I said, I'm a little bit biased to this lava lamp look.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to make a little lava lamp shape right now.	O
I'll grab like this cap and.	O
This cap.	CHITCHAT
Have it flare at the base.	O
This is just a little idea that I came up with a while back that I like quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
I thought it was pretty neat.	CHITCHAT
And we're going to make sure that this is transparent.	O
This inner bit here, I might add a few like overlay effects like a little bit of white here for some visual interest.	O
And maybe even below this, I'll fill this area in with a transparent color.	O
Some people might argue that transparency is cheating in pixel art.	CHITCHAT
I personally do not care.	CHITCHAT
It really depends on what your goal is.	CHITCHAT

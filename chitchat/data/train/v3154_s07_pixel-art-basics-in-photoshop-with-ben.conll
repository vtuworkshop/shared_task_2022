And my goal right now is to make a cool lava lamps.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to drop down the opacity of this a little bit and I think I can merge these and just move this over scale it down a little bit so that the whole flow of this is a nut shot.	O
Will slow this down quite a bit actually let's go to about 3 seconds in.	O
Will drag this out and move this as well, just to right there, so it's much slower.	O
And you might think yourself well that looks like OK.	O
It's a good start.	CHITCHAT
How does that get interesting and this is how it's interesting So what we're going to do is we're going to make a mask.	O
And the cool thing about masks an animating in photo shop is that well it's usually cool.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes is a bit annoying, but typically it's cool.	CHITCHAT
It will act independently of the animation.	O
So if we unlink the two of these by holding alt and clicking the link between the.	O
The layer icon in the mask icon we can unlink the 2.	O
Which is a little bit more difficult to see than it is to know I might kind of I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I might I might break that down a little bit in a second here.	O
I'm not really certain yet will shrink this down a little bit more to make sure it, fits nicely and with this mask.	O
I'm going to hold alt and then backspace with my black color selected and the Black is going to mask everything.	O
It's going to hide and Obscur Everything and I typically work with black-and-white actually I think you could only have black or white or grey while you're working with masks.	O
You want to get the opposite of your black which is going to be white.	O
Or maybe a great if you want it to be a little bit transparent and just fill the inside space of this lavalais up here with white.	O
And now instantly we get this cool effect all pixel art still.	CHITCHAT
Some might argue that it's like you know you can't tween with pixel art.	CHITCHAT
It's not really the same again.	CHITCHAT
I don't care.	CHITCHAT
It's not really a thing that I'm worrying about an even better.	CHITCHAT
While this is cool in grayscale wouldn't it be a lot cooler if it was actually proper color, so you can now go into gradient map.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Choose like a nice vivid color here, maybe something like uh let's try this one.	O
An bearing in mind, we have a little bit of Opacity on the glass, which maybe was executed poorly, but now since this is grayscale.	O
The gradient map will change the lighter values and darker values based on your gradient map grab like these colors again.	O
And then you get like a almost cool like.	CHITCHAT
Lava lamp effect all in pixel art so this isn't the limit of things you can do.	CHITCHAT
In fact, this is just the very beginning of the types of things you can do with pixel art in Photoshop, specifically because you can get these gradient Maps.	O
You can get these masks, you can get the tweens and Animations.	O
It's it's I'm I'm too narrowly skilled to tell you the extent of what you can do with this.	CHITCHAT
But I can tell you there's a lot, that you could do with this, it's incredible.	CHITCHAT
I have not gone to the limits of making like a full on scene with all these different elements.	CHITCHAT
I can show you a couple things I've worked on.	CHITCHAT
None of them will be terribly impressive, but it might be something that can inspire you guys.	CHITCHAT
Maybe maybe inspire you a little bit if I can find where I put them.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Where are they?	CHITCHAT
I know you're in here.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh, Lauren, Hey, thank you.	CHITCHAT
So here's a little scene that I made over here on the left, you can see that.	O
That effect that I just made.	CHITCHAT
We've got some animation of this TV.	CHITCHAT
These are all things that I didn't Photoshop so you can do all these as well.	O
Beautiful and also this little scene here, too, you can do all this info to shop.	O
The swinging a light bulb.	O
It's all done in Photoshop.	O
Here you can see I try to add some tasteful.	O
Glowy lights, which ended up not really being ideal and you can see how gross the mixture of aliased an anti alias lines, usually are if you're a good if you're good at what you're doing, you can maybe get away with with making it not so gross.	O
To add a little bit of depth, I used a I think it was just a?	O

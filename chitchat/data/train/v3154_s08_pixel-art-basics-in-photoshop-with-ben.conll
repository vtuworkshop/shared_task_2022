A a clipped gradient to go over Top of this guy to make him look a little bit more dynamic.	O
I think this only loops the one time, let's see if I can play it again.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Uh So what I'm going to do now since we have about Hyperic.	CHITCHAT
Since we have about 20 minutes.	CHITCHAT
I might try to mock up a little character scene and maybe do some Sprite art to show you guys, maybe what I would do.	O
To make a sheet like this possibly.	O
I don't really know exactly what I'm usually inspired by let me head over to Twitter real quick and see if I can find any other artists that do pixel art that I like and want to share.	CHITCHAT
I know that there is some I just don't know if I can find them.	CHITCHAT
They don't post terribly often.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Let me take a look at this here, we go.	CHITCHAT
Something like this would be kind of fun to do.	CHITCHAT
I want to make some little little landscapes as well.	CHITCHAT
Well, so we got.	CHITCHAT
You can never find what you're looking for if you go looking for it.	CHITCHAT
You have to look for it when you're not looking for it, you know what I mean.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Here's a good example as well.	O
I'd like to do stuff like this.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you like the street scene thank you.	CHITCHAT
I liked it.	CHITCHAT
When I made it.	CHITCHAT
I've stopped liking it as much as time has gone by?	CHITCHAT
But I think we can probably get into stuff like this.	CHITCHAT
There's some advanced techniques going on here, especially with the atmosphere an what school as well.	CHITCHAT
About photo shop is that you can use all the brushes that you're normally going to use for.	O
Let's just get rid of all this all the brushes.	O
You would normally use.	O
You can still use with pixel or it just won't be quite as detailed so.	O
So far I've been using just a brush.	O
I don't even know what brush this is it's the hard round brush you can grab like this softap.	O
Soft brush here.	O
And while it won't give necessarily the same effects that you wanted, it to have or that it would normally have.	O
While working on something it is still the same fundamental brush so you can get all these same effects with your normal brushes and got these scratches again a lot of these won't.	O
Give you the same expectations you normally have you'll have to kind of work with it but?	O
Like these clouds for example, might not be too bad.	O
And again lots of people have opinions about.	CHITCHAT
What is true pixel art you know that's a big controversy in some communities the people that like the very niche minority of people who actually want to make a big deal about what true pixlr isn't isn't will have opinions about that.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
I mean, if people say that they're making true pixel art and they're clearly not.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll have an opinion about that.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I do.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I don't.	CHITCHAT
It really depends on how I'm feeling on that day, I suppose my Instagram Twitter is Lt Tim.	CHITCHAT
I go by Lt Tim on Twitch and if you search well.	CHITCHAT
You might be able to find me.	CHITCHAT
If you search for it, I might be the Top result.	CHITCHAT
You can find my Twitch and you can also find my.	CHITCHAT
My Instagram I hope they're all linked on there, so you can go check me out over there, if you want to.	CHITCHAT
I tend to keep my be hand stuff and my not be hand stuff kind of separated they're both kind of different.	CHITCHAT
Environments different mentalities, so I like to try to keep him a little bit distinct, so you'll find me posting a lot of Dumber stuff on my different platforms.	CHITCHAT
Or usually more accurately nothing at all in a lot of cases.	CHITCHAT
But if you want to check out over there by all means feel free.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I have enough time in 15 minutes to make something.	CHITCHAT
But let's see what we can knockout will do a value painting.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go back to our roots of doing value paintings.	O
But try to get some pixel art added in there so.	O
Let's try to envision in our mind space.	CHITCHAT
A cool environment, I'm envisioning a forest with a rock.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I actually have a cool idea.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking earlier, about my trip to Taiwan and.	CHITCHAT
My friend and I would climb this huge staircase up into the up into the.	CHITCHAT
The mountains and there are trees everywhere.	CHITCHAT
And at the very Top we were sitting on Top of some rocks and we could see over the tree line in the distance was the city and of course, you had like old big old Taipei 101 hanging out sticking up out of the city to true pixel art.	CHITCHAT

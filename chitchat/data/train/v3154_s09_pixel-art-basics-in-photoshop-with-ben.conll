Oh my definition of regular pixel art or true pixel art so.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
What is not true pixelart?	CHITCHAT
Well, typically.	CHITCHAT
3D that's been rendered as pixel art is not typically pixel art is.	O
Every pixels placed by hand, so typically like AI or automation, assisted art is typically not pixel art so for example, if you get a photo and apply a filter over Top of it.	O
It's not really going to count actually this might be a good example.	CHITCHAT
I've got this really planet that I made an after effects a couple years ago.	CHITCHAT
And it's It's super grainy you can see how grainy that is.	O
It's so great to the point where you can see each pixel and it almost would look like pixel art to a degree.	O
I don't know how much you guys can see this on your side, but for me, this has very pixely looking aspects to it.	CHITCHAT
If I were to down scale out a little bit.	O
It would have even more pixels, but that would not be pixel art so JPEG ING something doesn't make it pixel art.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
But if you were to take like a photo.	O
Let's see if I have a good photo will just use this one for the sake of simplicity.	CHITCHAT
If you were to have like, this photo.	CHITCHAT
And then go to filter maybe noise pixelate.	O
And then go to like mosaic you know, and make the cell size kind of small.	O
This is not pixel art you know, even though there are it is based on pixels that has a very pixely look to it.	O
It's not really pixel art so games like Mortal Kombat if you guys play Mortal Kombat like.	CHITCHAT
Mortal Kombat 3, one, I think one and 2 to the same thing where they actually took photos of people and turn those into their sprites.	O
It's not really pixel art.	O
It is technically pixels, but it's more of like a photo scan than anything.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit of leeway on what you can and can't use I personally think would be a great idea to make 3D models and then either at a shader to them or scale them down to the point where they become pixels like that's incredibly useful and cool and thoughtful.	O
I think dead cells did the same thing.	O
I think that the workflow dead cells used is they made the model of their character.	O
They I think they use a shader to make it look like pixel art and then they made normal Maps over that pixel art.	O
To give it the depth and a normal map is basically.	O
I've got a good example actually let me just find this real quick?	CHITCHAT
Where did I put it.	CHITCHAT
Is it?	CHITCHAT
I hope it's quick to find there, we go perfect.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
So what I have here.	O
Is a normal map of this spreadsheet that I made?	O
So we have a character here.	O
And we have the normal map here in the normal map is basically it serves as like a bump or a heightmap to show you?	O
What is closer and further from the Camera and you can also use that typically in game engines with simulated lights to shade your pixel art in a way it otherwise wouldn't be shaded so this has very little shadow information to it.	O
This is very little depth to it, but when you apply the normal map to it.	O
In Enjun, you can get.	O
A much more dynamic look to it.	O
Would that be pixel art?	O
Yes, but also kinda know.	O
So that's where things get a little bit ambiguous.	O
When you're actually using proper pixel art, but using post processing effects to make it look different.	O
So that's a bit of a Gray area.	O
Obviously, if you just use this straight up.	O
It would be yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's definitely pixelart so typically those stuff like this.	O
I would call pixel art for sure because I made it stuff like this, yeah, definitely pixel art.	CHITCHAT
Even though it is using?	O
Some help when you use a gradient tool you're immediately taking yourself out of the equation.	O
So some people would say that because it's a gradient because it's computer generated.	O
It's not really, really considered Pixar at that point, so if I were to just take this and while there are some devry pixels in there.	O

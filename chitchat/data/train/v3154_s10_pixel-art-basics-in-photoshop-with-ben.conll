It's not really pixelart so.	O
Ultimately, though don't get too caught up about it if you're having fun.	CHITCHAT
That's all that really matters and I think there's a lot in the field of pixel art that needs to be expanded on there's a still a pretty strong divide between 3D and pixel art.	CHITCHAT
That's not really been capitalized on I think it would be fascinating to see a much more stark.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Oh really.	CHITCHAT
I think that, well, I don't know I've looked a little bit into Blenders.	CHITCHAT
Pixel art shaders, but I've yet to find anything terribly interesting yet, but I think I did see one guy making a particular particularly cool.	CHITCHAT
Pixel already looking fella, he made like an ostrich, I think I actually let's take a look here.	CHITCHAT
I think I have it saved.	CHITCHAT
Let's try to find this real quick.	CHITCHAT
Wow, there's a lot here.	CHITCHAT
Can I just like search?	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
So this is in blender an it's really cool to be able to make a 3D character make it 3D model that's really easy to animate and pose and give different perspectives, too.	CHITCHAT
But still make it look like its pixel art.	CHITCHAT
And since I've been messing around a lot with sculpting in blender and even opening unity in messing around in there.	CHITCHAT
I think I might jump into this a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately, though blender is not an Adobe owned program and they typically prefer, if you use Adobe programs on Behance so I might not be able to share that with you guys, but I can probably show you the workflow of taking it out of blender and making a spreadsheet and photo shop that might be a good a good work around.	CHITCHAT
So I might do that, but this is really cool.	CHITCHAT
I like the way that looks a lot, but bearing in mind.	CHITCHAT
There's some very obvious like not hand placed pixels here.	CHITCHAT
I don't think that really matters, too much.	CHITCHAT
But you can't really call this true Pixelart because it's using you know gradients and overlays and different blend modes as well.	CHITCHAT
Uhm let me actually.	CHITCHAT
Block out a quick composition.	CHITCHAT
That's definitely not pixelart.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to block out a quick composition.	CHITCHAT
So that next time we come back to this we can actually paint something.	CHITCHAT
And have something to do next time, which might be tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I'm thinking I might do a couple of our long streams every day.	CHITCHAT
Because I recently left my job my really lousy temporary part time bookstore job and now I have way more time to hang out with my friends on the Internet, which is very exciting.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think I like this composition quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
Like this so look nice.	CHITCHAT
We had a mountain back there, too.	CHITCHAT
We'll get some big clouds in there as well.	CHITCHAT
Those are clouds if you guys were wondering.	CHITCHAT
And actually one thing I noticed I didn't really ever think about this before will save this real quick.	CHITCHAT
One thing I haven't really noticed is that there's not a lot of pixel on Behance.	CHITCHAT
There's just like very little and I don't really know why I'm not sure if it's um.	CHITCHAT
Because it's not as.	CHITCHAT
Let me just find this folder or is it.	CHITCHAT
Do you guys have any theories as to why there's not very much pixel art on?	CHITCHAT
Huntington's is it because it doesn't look as professional 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I think that a lot of pixel art can look really good if you're good at it.	CHITCHAT
But if we just scroll.	CHITCHAT
Let's look at the for you tab, which we're going to come to anyways because I want to share with you guys what people have been working on as usual.	CHITCHAT
All your enthusiastic about that.	CHITCHAT
Lauren thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm also enthusiastic about it, too, like you could maybe argue that some of the dithering stuff like here with this dissolved brush like that's kind of Pixely, but it's really not.	CHITCHAT
It has a bit of that look to it, but Otherwise, there's just none, which is surprising to me because.	CHITCHAT
Good pixel are looks so beautiful it really looks insane.	CHITCHAT

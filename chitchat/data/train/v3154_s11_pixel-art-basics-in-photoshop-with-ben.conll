And hopefully maybe possibly I can capitalize on that and uh take the niche that hopefully exists and has an audience for it and fill it with my own pixel art and I could be the Top dog of the Behance Pixel Artists.	CHITCHAT
'cause I couldn't be anywhere else.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately, yeah, not really a whole lot on here bout pixelart so with That being said, We are going to do my everyday segment.	CHITCHAT
'cause we got about 4 minutes left of the stream.	CHITCHAT
I like to for those of you want to where I like to take a look at the Discover Page and the for you page and look at whether people up, too because there's a lot of really crazy artists on here and.	CHITCHAT
I think one thing that's really nice about the artist, community is being able to uplift each other look at other peoples work and share it with each other because you know, sometimes as much as we don't like to be.	CHITCHAT
Conceited I don't know what I would say.	CHITCHAT
Dependent on other peoples validation how about that.	CHITCHAT
As much as we like to not feel that way.	CHITCHAT
It sure does feel nice.	CHITCHAT
When people come by, and say nice word.	CHITCHAT
You know, especially the people in chat here today, giving me positive feedback on my pixel art stuff, even though I didn't do anything cool today.	CHITCHAT
Even though this is all.	CHITCHAT
I really did that was interesting.	CHITCHAT
You guys still came by with kind words, so let's try to take those kind words and passes on to other people as well.	CHITCHAT
And I'm immediately caught by Victor con like he just got 4 really cool pieces lined up right here.	CHITCHAT
That are really neat looking I will take a look at this one.	CHITCHAT
Let's find a couple to look at, I like Cindy's work here.	CHITCHAT
And I think I also like Jose reels work so let's take a quick look through here.	CHITCHAT
I love I'm not going to say, I love comic book art.	CHITCHAT
But I like liner a lot.	CHITCHAT
I love really cool line art and, typically like Marvel Comics will have a lot of that.	CHITCHAT
Comparing the modern Marvel Comics to the old modern Carvel Comics.	CHITCHAT
Old Marvel Comics.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
The line art has changed dramatically.	CHITCHAT
If you guys remember looking at like some of the old school stuff.	CHITCHAT
The standard 6 panels that are very congruent with each other.	CHITCHAT
Comparing it to nowadays you get stuff that's a lot more like this and I love how dynamic it is.	CHITCHAT
It's incredible news that they could spend so much time, making such beautiful pieces of Art.	CHITCHAT
Not saying that Jose real here is necessarily a pro comic book artist.	CHITCHAT
As in doing it for work.	CHITCHAT
This is still like on par with what you'd expect and thinking that people like pump out art like this everyday.	CHITCHAT
For days on end blows me away the same with manga man manga is an incredible but let's just take a quick look through here.	CHITCHAT
This is all really cool.	CHITCHAT
I love.	CHITCHAT
Good visual line shape.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why he's nude, but you know that's his business isn't it.	CHITCHAT
I won't question that too much.	CHITCHAT
I can't spend too long on these because we only have a few minutes left that I don't really want to go over my time.	CHITCHAT
But will do what we can.	CHITCHAT
Very nice.	CHITCHAT
Fantastic.	CHITCHAT
This is work by Victor con from 2018 a little bit dated but.	CHITCHAT
Interesting Lee Let's take a look here at at his most recent work.	CHITCHAT
I think there's a lot more grit to his newer stuff.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not.	CHITCHAT
We had looked recently at his what do we look at it was this cat?	CHITCHAT
You see how gritty the dithering is on this work here.	CHITCHAT
Very gritty.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't expecting to see something so clean.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Laura I appreciate you.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably be streaming around this time right now, it's 11:00 o'clock for Maine in the morning EDT so.	CHITCHAT
I'll probably stream or around this time because I have a nice amount of time by myself without anybody else around.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to be going on a Twitch actually pretty soon too.	CHITCHAT
So that's a rough schedule for me, I keep it loose.	CHITCHAT
I keep it kind of kind of you know tangible tangible flexible able to be.	CHITCHAT
Here we go this is a bit more gritty.	CHITCHAT
Man these are so cool.	CHITCHAT
I love the visual style, it's so distinct.	CHITCHAT

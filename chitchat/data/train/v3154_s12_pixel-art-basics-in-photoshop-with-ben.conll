And recognizable as well like this is clearly totoro, but it's so much disguise version.	CHITCHAT
Man this is really cool.	CHITCHAT
A Kitty to the past, you alright well done Victor.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit disheartening to see as many good art pieces on here.	CHITCHAT
I recently made a post on Twitter, saying that my favorite thing about being an artist is that you can spend 20 years.	CHITCHAT
Doing it and still be bad.	CHITCHAT
And that's definitely how I feel, especially looking at stuff like this.	CHITCHAT
What you don't get to see?	CHITCHAT
And a single art piece is the history in the time in the effort put into it.	CHITCHAT
You can see the results of that, but you don't get to see the full story you know.	CHITCHAT
This person could be 18 years old to be an absolute prodigy or they could be.	CHITCHAT
You know 45 and spent 4 decades of their life working on it day in day out, you know you don't really get to see the experience.	CHITCHAT
You don't get to see the components of the experience you get to see the results.	CHITCHAT
Of the work put in but you don't get to see exactly what work it was does that make sense.	CHITCHAT
'cause I've seen artists that are like yeah, I'm 16 years old.	CHITCHAT
I'm a professional artist, I make beautiful art pieces.	CHITCHAT
I love progress shots on.	CHITCHAT
I especially like seeing somebody who's not terribly certain what they want to do with their but their anatomy.	CHITCHAT
And actually you know when I looked at this piece up here.	CHITCHAT
I did feel like Oh, I guess it was this one here.	CHITCHAT
I did feel like the anatomy wasn't quite.	CHITCHAT
Like strong enough on the legs here this feels incredibly exaggerated and incorrect.	CHITCHAT
And I wonder if.	CHITCHAT
If there's a breakdown of this one.	CHITCHAT
Looks like they struggled a little bit there, like that stance is just too wide.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what do you guys think?	CHITCHAT
Anyways that's uhm.	CHITCHAT
Cindy Avelino.	CHITCHAT
And oracles deception.	CHITCHAT
Perfect alright.	CHITCHAT
Well, with That being said, I'm sorry if you just got here.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
If you're expectancy pixel art and you end up seeing somebody else is aren't entirely.	CHITCHAT
Going to close these and.	CHITCHAT
Basically, what we did today I shouldn't have deleted all that stuff, we did a very brief exploration into the foundations of pixel art.	CHITCHAT
Basically, all you need to know make a small document get a small brush make it into a pencil without without antialiasing.	O
You want to have aliased lines.	O
I think that's what it is anti aliasing makes it sound like the opposite of what it is, but you want to get nice tight lines very small pixel based art and, if you want to go to view show pixel grid that way.	O
You can see the pixel grid.	O
You're working with here.	O
Those are all the foundations tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I think I'll come back.	CHITCHAT
And we'll paint this in pixel art mode and I'll talk a little bit more about specific techniques that I'm using hopefully making a cool piece.	CHITCHAT
I'm not a great environment drawer not.	CHITCHAT
I'm not good at painting landscapes or environments.	CHITCHAT
Not good at pixel art.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really good at any of this stuff.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm passable, though, and hopefully passable is going to for you guys and will do that tomorrow, so again.	CHITCHAT
That's me that's the stream.	CHITCHAT
And uh yeah, see around Oh actually before we go.	CHITCHAT
Let me take a look here.	CHITCHAT
We've got a couple of notifications here and I think I should respond to those.	CHITCHAT
Lisa Danny Hamza my Lauren Bernie and Mark all thank you.	CHITCHAT
I think you all for falling my work today.	CHITCHAT
I hope that this was fun hope it was a little educational hope it was inspiring as well because I think if I can't be a great artist.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully, I can make other people want to become better.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's what I can do.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to take a look at all your profiles and see what kind of work you all?	CHITCHAT
Do 'cause I'm sure that you're all very fantastic artists as well.	CHITCHAT
I tend to find that people that come by.	CHITCHAT
Are usually much better than I am so I hope I'm not preaching to the choir with these these little pixel arts, but, Yeah Alright.	CHITCHAT
For Top over the end card.	CHITCHAT
Lauren thank you.	CHITCHAT

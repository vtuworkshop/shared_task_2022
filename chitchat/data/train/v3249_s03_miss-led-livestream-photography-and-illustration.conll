So lots of overlaying lots of opacities.	O
Ann and I really enjoyed doing this piece is one of 3 from this series that we used.	CHITCHAT
So for today, I have another in a series of.	O
This photo shoot and this was taken a couple of years ago in London and I really, really love the treatment and the editing and I uh as I said, I have another piece like this so I'm going to work.	O
This is something that I'm working on at the moment because.	CHITCHAT
It for me because I work in so many different ways.	CHITCHAT
I got really excited about one style of work or gotten kind of application or approach and then when I'm finished.	CHITCHAT
I'm like Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
This is another thing I really want to do so.	CHITCHAT
For me, I'm trying to be really strict on creating a body of work so if I have at least 3 pieces that are a family of work so.	CHITCHAT
That brings me on to this piece.	CHITCHAT
So this obviously is you can see my hair is the same and I've got the same shirt on so this is from the same photo series from the same shoot.	CHITCHAT
And this is just some doodling I did on the iPod.	CHITCHAT
But you can see that this pose allows some for me to think about it in a different way.	CHITCHAT
and I wanted this to be so the first one, that I worked on that showed you with called stay playful.	CHITCHAT
And I wanted this one to be about growing so obviously being playful in its approach the colour.	CHITCHAT
Maybe the elements I use.	CHITCHAT
But also I wanted it because I had my set of pencil in hand.	CHITCHAT
I wanted it to feel like there was something flowing from my pencil.	CHITCHAT
And that I'm actually drawing something in it's becoming an environment and I like the idea of.	CHITCHAT
The sense of growth and something growing from me and the statement being quite.	CHITCHAT
Quite a sort of encouraging.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Statement for knees well because it's something that I want to try and do I'm always trying to develop and grow?	CHITCHAT
My work and it's just like a reminder that was was was going to say like I remind Aurora Moucheron.	CHITCHAT
Not something that's a real theme throughout my work is is just things that we can remind ourselves to do and sometimes you do kinda need a bit of a reminder.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Because I had a a fiddle around with this and I kind of thought about things that I wanted to appear in this piece.	CHITCHAT
Because it's talking about growing because if something is coming out of my.	CHITCHAT
Hand and I use a lot if you see here, I use a lot of this sort of.	CHITCHAT
Lines and shapes and are trying to try to acknowledge the figure.	CHITCHAT
And I wanted it to design with this.	CHITCHAT
So using kind of organic shapes and plants and elements like the sun and so on, but I decided that I wanted to.	CHITCHAT
Start again so here I am at the blank page.	CHITCHAT
And here I haven't gone, too, crazy with going into my original image.	CHITCHAT
I just wanted to kind of move with this so I literally just cut out, everything I did on the earlier image so that I can.	O
Extend the converse at something that I'm doing a lot even if I'm working on my iPad.	O
I'm trying to extend out.	CHITCHAT
I talked about this in my last live stream and how important it is to keep.	CHITCHAT
Allowing white space because I think when you working 2 sheet of a four or you're working too.	CHITCHAT
A iPod screen or small back on screen.	CHITCHAT
It's really easy to feel like you've completed something when you get to the edge and.	CHITCHAT

I'm finding that if I can expand the converse.	CHITCHAT
Then I've got more in theme growth to expand it and to bring in more ideas and then I'm finding that my ideas of developing too.	CHITCHAT
So that's a bit of a tip for me.	CHITCHAT
Oh, not so.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Also, for anyone that hasn't seen anywhere live streams.	CHITCHAT
There is a small cap with me, so any licking noises scratching or anything.	CHITCHAT
You know biscuit crunching that that will be here.	CHITCHAT
Her name is Matt cruel and.	CHITCHAT
And she likes to go to hang out and just.	CHITCHAT
You know make me feel awkward.	CHITCHAT
With hair color.	CHITCHAT
Funny noises.	CHITCHAT
So that would be heard only.	CHITCHAT
And she probably needs going out the door coming back in so I'll make my excuses now.	CHITCHAT
So for this piece, I wanted to think about what I wanted to use it for obviously I said before that, I wanted to.	CHITCHAT
Create a body work for me and to develop this kind of style of working.	CHITCHAT
But I also I also want to think about it in a?	CHITCHAT
As something that I do that can potentially generate more work and that's how.	CHITCHAT
If you want to be a professional illustrator will design.	CHITCHAT
It's a really good way of approaching your work because.	CHITCHAT
I know that it's really easy.	CHITCHAT
Too and I'm very guilty of this to just spend a lot of time.	CHITCHAT
Just drawing stuff that you really like and just kind of like Seri, 8 in this kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is so nice and things in every drawing today without actually.	CHITCHAT
Thinking about what it can do where it could take you.	CHITCHAT
You want to see it how it could.	CHITCHAT
Work on a surface what surface would that be would it be on a screen would it be on a product and that's something again that I talk to a lot of my.	CHITCHAT
I took a lot about in my sessions, when I'm doing my mentals I shouldn't so.	CHITCHAT
So this is really good to kind of think about so and it gives you a bit of.	CHITCHAT
It could do a few clues about how you want to kind of approach it so I quite like the idea of this being.	CHITCHAT
Maybe a print like a poster so it's it's it could be something that is.	CHITCHAT
Advertising something it could be advertising a person.	CHITCHAT
It could be.	CHITCHAT
When I say advertising this man in this could be an editorial piece that is a story about a artist.	CHITCHAT
About a celebrity or something so if that's something that has a narrative.	CHITCHAT
Then it's already giving you a clue to the story, which is really great for editorial that could be something in a magazine or it could be on the front cover.	CHITCHAT
It could also be something that lends itself to album art or.	CHITCHAT
Like a record cover or something like that, so it's really nice idea to really think about.	CHITCHAT
What it could be even if it's just for you?	CHITCHAT
Because once you start asking those questions, they can give you clues to how you want to kind of develop that piece.	CHITCHAT
It becomes a bit more exciting and you can kind of get your teeth into it a bit more.	CHITCHAT
And then if you're thinking OK well.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it is for some album art, then that could be a great sort of.	CHITCHAT
Starting point for some research that you're doing.	CHITCHAT
And you start building it as a project.	CHITCHAT
Once you start fining images that you like then you can just kind of drop them into Pinterest.	CHITCHAT
Pinterest can help fight.	CHITCHAT

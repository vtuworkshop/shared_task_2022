Find more images and then that idea is not to grow and grow and grow and then you've got like a really strong piece.	CHITCHAT
So for me.	CHITCHAT
And just kind of going ahead and I'm just.	O
Need to label my legs because I try and keep everything on different layers.	O
At this stage so that I can kind of move things around and then the more things I move and manipulate change shape flip horizontally or whatever.	O
The more I can kind of sort of have this sort of discussion with the piece if not make sense so if I'm flipping something or changing the color of their other changing their position it might tell me something.	CHITCHAT
Make make me think about it in a different way so that's what I mean about having this kind of conversation with it.	CHITCHAT
So start with Because I want to have sort of like a classic.	CHITCHAT
Want to maybe make sort of a classic composition with this.	CHITCHAT
I'm Going to put some of my some lines in here.	O
So I have.	CHITCHAT
So, just bring them so I know exactly where the center.	O
Of this is so the way I find the center is basically.	O
Just transform the cat the countless.	O
It's really quick way without doing any meds.	CHITCHAT
So I tried to pull the County canvas and then I can see where the four points are.	O
And then I moved the line over.	O
It's just really quick.	CHITCHAT
OK and then I'm going to do that again.	O
Canvas.	O
And then I can find this one, so this is kind of like Classic Wolf.	O
Projects that I would do in school for city place poster design because I'm thinking about using text for this and I want to have a think about going to have 2 separate words.	O
Those separate words will have different kinds of spaces.	O
One might be curved in one might be.	O
I'm thinking about on a flag or another shape.	O
So I want it to be vibrant.	O
So I've got these take these rumors off I need to move forward.	CHITCHAT
Me too much.	CHITCHAT
I need to do this again 'cause Multitasking is kinda hard.	CHITCHAT
Chatting working.	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking sometime.	CHITCHAT
It's not an easy task.	CHITCHAT
OK, so, so I've got my cross.	O
Lines in here, so I've got that so now.	O
I need to make a stroke.	O
That's what I was doing was known.	CHITCHAT
So if this is my.	CHITCHAT
There isn't a line.	O
And then I want to put in.	O
Actually, that was.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
This is my arc.	O
Which will probably be?	CHITCHAT
Manipulated or just put both of those in at the same because that's not going to change anyway is at the center of the peace and less, I change.	O
The canvas size but at the moment I'm not going to do that, so for me, knowing where the center is is great because I want to use some tax so I might put my art and make sure that I'm placing that in the center, so again.	O
I just transform it so I know where.	O
That is, it's quite good, I quite like the scientist just above the I had something that I'm I try and focus on if my character is leading the peace.	O
The Arm is really important like the kind of shape of the limb that is going to give me a guide about where I want to have these shapes as well so.	O
Once I've got some lines in they can help me kind of build an idea of what works with the figure so these are just the basics to start with.	O
K I'm going to repeat this arc.	O
This is my copy and then I'm going to bring it down like this because I might.	O

Like to have some.	CHITCHAT
Some text that.	CHITCHAT
Kay.	CHITCHAT
Right So what other lines do we want so with this light line at the bottom they need to worry too much about that?	CHITCHAT
And now that I've got my Arkin.	O
Double check that that still central.	O
Yep.	CHITCHAT
And then I might even take these out so that I can start bringing in.	O
More fluid lines.	O
And as I showed you before, and as you can see I do a lot of I know love, creating kind of like smoke lines.	O
GS organic lines and character lines that have like a little bit of kind of free flow because.	O
I think they bring a lot with movement to the peace actually it's just something that I really enjoy drawing.	CHITCHAT
So from The shape.	O
Of the party.	O
I like the idea of how things might put this in a different color.	O
So what might help for this because I don't want to keep going and changing my my color palette just wanted to keep.	O
Free flowing essentially I'm going to actually just change the color of my.	O
Layer so I'm going to put a color overlay and I'm going to go back to this really lovely sort of.	O
And cooling it Dutch Blue I don't think it is, but it's just like a warm light blue.	O
And that is going to help me because I don't have to.	O
Then go back and change it.	O
And I'm right, I might have a few layers on that color as well.	O
So again with my brushes, especially if I'm starting with let's say my kind of sketchy.	O
There's lines and then I normally keep the Lions.	O
The Opacity quite.	O
Low that means that I feel like I can work on Top.	O
They not dominating too much and I can kind of see beyond them if that makes sense.	O
So I will maybe start with like even like 35 or something I will go with the.	O
I change the name of this brush.	O
I keep calling it a commentary because it feels like it's gets off pastor dependent so.	O
So if I put it in #51, you can see.	O
Let's put this like really lovely almost kind of like Willie kind of texture to it, so I use this.	O
Unlock actually and a bit obsessed with it because it gives me kind of I.	CHITCHAT
I've used it a lot.	CHITCHAT
I trust in it, and it feels the closest to doing something organic.	O
In committed digital medium and it is quite pale.	O
I use it and then a generally have to.	O
Duplicate the layers a lot at the end, but I'm OK with that because I think it's a confidence thing for me.	O
Be cause I want to feel an it's a way that I've used for working on neural design and.	CHITCHAT
And large scale work, where you start with for example, with the paint.	CHITCHAT
Even though you're using acrylic paint or?	CHITCHAT
Again motion or something always start with more water than paint, so that you know you're slowly building.	CHITCHAT
The piece up and it's about having that patience to build it up and then you're making decisions as it grows rather than if you put.	CHITCHAT
You'll paint down.	CHITCHAT
Straight away.	CHITCHAT
Then you don't really have ruined, it just feels too finished.	CHITCHAT
It feels to final and it's very difficult to kind of learn from the decisions you're making on the peace.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if that doesn't make sense, but I think it does.	CHITCHAT
So I'm gonna take this down from 51 to something like 12 or something.	O
So it's gonna go quite small any of it gonna see.	O

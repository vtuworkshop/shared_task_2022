See what happens if I put it on.	O
17.	O
'Cause.	CHITCHAT
I use this to draw all the details like my hair and.	O
The shading around the face everything and I.	O
Feel like even if I am drawing the head.	O
I'm drawing every single.	O
So I will use this.	O
Digital brush.	O
Generally, on a #4 but that's similar to how I use my drawing pen so.	O
An all user no point.	O
3 or something.	O
OK, so I'm looking at the lines.	O
I've got here on the body.	O
And I love the idea of having something.	CHITCHAT
Around and behind.	CHITCHAT
The figure.	CHITCHAT
And sort of Beacon knowledge ING.	CHITCHAT
This shape.	CHITCHAT
Of the shirt here.	CHITCHAT
And just adding so I made a rough sketch that's why I'm looking over here.	O
Make you say?	CHITCHAT
Needed to prep so it wasn't going to Crazily.	CHITCHAT
Free flowing.	CHITCHAT
But I just got the lines and then everything else, I'm.	CHITCHAT
I'm totally with you, I'm working out as I go along.	CHITCHAT
So here is a bit smaller.	O
But I need to know that these are connecting so I'm gonna go over the figure which is fine.	O
Make this a blue lines bottom.	O
Waves so that doesn't necessarily mean they are going to be waves.	O
But they have that kind of wave like field service could be water.	O
It could be pattern.	O
It could be the beginning of anything but what I want to do is just fill that space.	O
And then see whether extends out here.	O
So I'm going to now that I've got.	CHITCHAT
My shoulder now that I've got.	O
Just pattern work that I'm doing here.	O
I'm gonna move my smiling all the way up to.	O
68 I'm going to see what difference that makes.	O
In the US quite nice.	CHITCHAT
So I might go back to make that minds new, though.	CHITCHAT
OK and if I lower the Opacity.	O
And I put it underneath the photograph.	O
Then it's not too disruptive.	O
Obviously, I've got those lines on a shirt.	O
An that I didn't remove earlier.	O
But I'm not I don't think they're affecting the next phase is too much so.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to keep going without without fussing with it, too much.	CHITCHAT
Because I have the original piece and then when I'm ready with the whole composition.	CHITCHAT
I can then.	CHITCHAT
Take the original piece and spend the time after it's finished.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of editing cleaning up making sure that it looks good and it fits perfectly.	CHITCHAT
So more blue line here.	O
Alphabet.	CHITCHAT
So at the moment I don't really know what these shapes will be.	CHITCHAT
And smoothing doesn't really love that much either.	CHITCHAT
Extending lines so.	CHITCHAT
But just getting these in these might be clues for where I parked my solid line.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Really influenced.	CHITCHAT
By kind of sucks, I could've it.	CHITCHAT
Oh really bright colors shapes that's something I've been obsessed with since I was a teenager actually an and that.	CHITCHAT

Connects a lot with set up poster design remember doing something for my.	CHITCHAT
My GCSE's.	CHITCHAT
Where I did a club poster?	CHITCHAT
And it was all about lots of different kind of subcultures and just sort of bright psychedelic kind of I.	CHITCHAT
ID's and was really, really inspired by The Beatles Apple.	CHITCHAT
Record.	CHITCHAT
It was the record company image if you haven't seen it.	CHITCHAT
You've gotta check it out.	CHITCHAT
If you will and it's an image of a sort of.	CHITCHAT
Magician or sorcerer, he's holding a?	CHITCHAT
Maybe kind of like.	CHITCHAT
A glass sphere, so eh, it's just really cool and it's just so psychedelic and it's got so much detail in it, and I copied the whole peace when I was about 13.	CHITCHAT
And my mom still has it and it's just wild yeah.	CHITCHAT
I absolutely loved it because it just kept going into more detail in more detail in more detail in all these tiny little things and everything flowing often this kind of really kind of acid dreamlike style.	CHITCHAT
So I've kind of kept that sort of visual sentiments.	CHITCHAT
The inspiration and that does kind of flow a bit.	CHITCHAT
Through my work.	CHITCHAT
Kay.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Do another layer 4.	O
The section stuff that's going to come out so I want to make sure that what I'm doing basically is I'm starting from the character, creating sort of beginnings of compositional lines or compositional ox or flowing lines that might they might not be the definite fill lines, they might not be a definite shape at their just giving me the beginning clues of Harlan to build the peace.	O
An and there, starting from the figure and then they're going out of the canvas so I want it to feel like?	O
That this is an image that just kind of continues out and we just cropping this scene in a way.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I don't want that kind of so I started another layer so I'm going back to color overlay.	O
Clicking that and make that into like this is kind of blue.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Lowering the past 835.	O
So I'm gonna I know where my compositional lines are so I'm going to start from the Top.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Can I've got smoothing on and then my lines are normally quite tight but?	O
I've got my smoothening onto 48, nine so that's really helping.	O
And I don't know if you can see, there's like a little bit of a delay.	CHITCHAT
I guess you aren't but also on the playback.	CHITCHAT
You'll be able to see So what will happen is I will draw life for a couple of hours.	CHITCHAT
Another hour and a bit.	CHITCHAT
And once that is process, which takes like maybe 10 minutes or so that will be uploaded for you to have a culture because I doubt anyone is going to want to.	CHITCHAT
Spent 2 hours looking me, drawing some kind of smoke lines.	CHITCHAT
I mean, you know, I would love it.	CHITCHAT
If you did, if you didn't have anything better to do today.	CHITCHAT
And when you watch the playback you'll be able to see all the tools, I use.	CHITCHAT
An which is great because obviously at the moment.	CHITCHAT
You can't see everything you can see my layers.	CHITCHAT
But things like when I'm using a color overlay on the layers things like that, and you'll be able to see that that clearer.	CHITCHAT

And we cannot doing with that light quite like.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
Something that more like this.	CHITCHAT
So I'm getting a bit more experimental with these lines.	CHITCHAT
They all acknowledge each other.	CHITCHAT
But now they're kind of almost looking like it could be smoke?	CHITCHAT
What could be the start or flower.	CHITCHAT
And obviously I'm looking at the theme of growth so Flowers of going to feature in here somewhere.	CHITCHAT
Let's just finish here, so.	O
I'm Playing with a lot of canvas here that's because I have.	CHITCHAT
These guys not this one.	CHITCHAT
These guides here is kind of egg shapes.	O
They're going to help me build A.	O
Statement.	O
I mean, I do get to appoint with my pieces where I've just thrown so much.	CHITCHAT
It's so maximal.	CHITCHAT
That sometimes I will decide I don't want misstatements, but really for what element.	CHITCHAT
For I'd like to do I think this will be nice to kind of many pitch for magazines or for advertising products.	CHITCHAT
And when you have a little bit of text.	CHITCHAT
It really helps because it will give CEO directors and.	CHITCHAT
Art buyers an idea of how you can.	CHITCHAT
Adastra trying to a Advertising image or you can say something about a story for an editorial piece.	CHITCHAT
And it's just great to show that you can do text work as well.	CHITCHAT
So get it done if it going to bring those lines in now, so I know where I'm working.	O
And I'm gonna add some more.	O
Let me label this next so this is a blue lines.	O
I'm going to call them smokes, they look a bit like smoke.	O
Top.	O
Get there in the Top of the canvas.	O
OK so I always do have a?	CHITCHAT
Sicular image that the son I could be just like something that allows me to similar to hear.	CHITCHAT
To add another kind of solid form to sort of frame or guide more.	CHITCHAT
Shape and line.	CHITCHAT
And that's just something I've used in more work for what seems like that ever.	CHITCHAT
And this one has it here in the back.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go and you can see here, I've got some solid shapes and reflects circular shape.	O
So I'm going to think about where I want to put these circular shapes here.	O
So I'm just gonna pop circular shape.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
If they can have.	CHITCHAT
We cannot see it here we go OK.	CHITCHAT
I need to, we see hold down.	CHITCHAT
Shift if I want this perfectly round, which I do.	O
And again I'm gonna keep too.	O
Lines at the moment, we're going to keep the lines quite.	O
Pale.	O
So they're not disrupting any others and I can I can keep working on Top.	O
So I just add this as a stroke.	O
And you're right this 2nd thank you.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit thick.	O
So I'm just going to bring Europe Acity Down and as it's a stroke.	O
I can maybe get delete part of it at the moment I'm just going to.	O
Keep it small.	O
And put it here, I don't know actually it's tempting from like.	O

Actually.	CHITCHAT
But if These bits so it's not taking up too much space at the moment and I could always recreate.	O
That later.	O
And you can see where I want to move that.	O
If that is going to be like a setting sun or.	O
Shape so this is what I had in my scared really taking it right now.	O
But I'm going to go with it.	O
Because I can always kind of knock it back.	O
And what I mean by that is.	O
Can just?	CHITCHAT
Take.	O
The Opacity down so when I'm knocking it back and just taking it into the background.	O
So when you not back in in painting sometimes.	O
Uh colours, too, vibrant or 2 Toman Ants, a shape or something then I will use those lines terribly.	O
Maybe a glaze.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
Very very watery white or Gray and just apply it so you're putting another layer on it.	O
So it feels more like it in the distant so that's what I mean by knocking back.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
This isn't working, so much for me now.	O
But these might not be as I said fine lines.	O
This is going to be guides.	O
So I can just take this circular shape down anyway.	O
So it barely visible and then it's not affecting my eye, too much.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Also wanted another one up here if that's not too much overkill.	CHITCHAT
Then it look out.	CHITCHAT
Putting the circular line here.	O
Again, just make it as a stroke this same color.	O
Making sure the label planning layers because it's.	O
Hey Fiona, I'm yes, I was just saying so nice to see you on the chat.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it's a funny time for a lot of people I know it's kind of early evening in the UK and where I am in Lisbon.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it is available.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be available to watch later and all the other videos.	CHITCHAT
So just check in it will be on My Portfolio for anyone that can't continue watching.	CHITCHAT
It's going to sit on My Portfolio, so you just go into videos like you did today and you'll be able to.	CHITCHAT
Flip through and skim through the video.	CHITCHAT
Whenever and how often you like so yeah, nice to see if you now.	CHITCHAT
And can be going to make this bigger.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
So things are starting to overlap and things starting to make a bit sense, so I am now because we've got we've got quite a wide.	O
Canvas I mean for me because when I when I do portraits.	O
They canvas is very tight around the portrait.	O
So it kind of expanded it out now that it's expected that I want to connect to expand the Ark and start thinking about lettering.	O
And if that will go in because I don't want to keep adding too much detail and then realize that 'cause this does happen and I have done it.	O
This is easily done.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to end up having like a really lovely composition, but my lettering has.	O
Up.	CHITCHAT
Has affected the bottoms of it or just can't be viewed because there's something else going on?	O

And then I'm having to go back to square one so I'm just gonna play around with this.	O
And then again, I'm gonna go back to my original line, so I know that this is always central.	O
So my vertical lines are in there.	O
So ground.	O
And then so.	CHITCHAT
And then Do that with rulers too.	O
Kay.	CHITCHAT
OK, so ever so slightly.	O
Right.	O
So I want I want the.	CHITCHAT
The text to feel like.	O
Fluid in the theme with the other lines and that the whole style of the peace.	O
So I don't want to go to uniform into stroked with it, so text is going to be something that I'm kind of going to fiddle with a lot.	O
I think so.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to apologize about that right now.	CHITCHAT
So the vertical line is going to help me because just on a basic sense whether it's going to be fluid or not.	O
I'm going to still want to work with those.	O
Rules of How to divide it because I want it to be symmetrical at least?	O
So at least if I start symmetrical and then I can play with it like anything so at least you know when you know her face is constructed and use your guidelines.	O
Once you start with that, then you can start playing with extending bits or except waiting someone star for kind of elongating other part so it's good to have a knowledge of like the structure of things and then you can kind of play with it, so that's that's why I've got these kind of typed.	O
An original structure lines.	O
And the Would I wanna put in the middle is gross?	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to make this layer, but also I'm just going to right at the Top.	O
Even though it's So.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Crazy smoothing on his icon right probably not for this meeting back to say 15.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
No, I need to remind myself how to spell it.	CHITCHAT
But it's good for me.	CHITCHAT
True member what it looks like so I'm just doing like a basic sketch.	CHITCHAT
And I kinda wanna play with.	O
The text there quite like the sort of Top heavy style.	O
And quite like a mix of.	O
Capitals and lowercase so that could be something but the moment and just going to block in where these letters are going to be so OK.	O
So obviously if you're working to symmetry is good to workout the center of your.	O
Metric is Coffee.	O
Those gaps in between my sense of my words.	O
OK, OK, it says 123456.	O
So this is really easy.	CHITCHAT
We just bought a line.	O
Little.	O
Actually.	CHITCHAT
Hold it, I definitely need another calf coffee because I don't want actually.	O
I don't want to do growth, too hard.	O
I want to do growing.	CHITCHAT
Actually.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
OK, so that's 1234567.	O

So we want to go.	O
123.	O
4.	O
123123 so that's quite nice, so it cuts right in the middle of the W.	O
Great.	CHITCHAT
And I'm looking at it here and I'm thinking the.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't feel the right distance to me?	O
Let's play with that.	O
And I think I want it a bit thicker because obviously if you're going to add your text here.	O
Have to think about this sort of.	O
Sizing.	O
The shape how far over you want to go.	O
Maybe you want to bring that line in.	O
In the sense of.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's too wide.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a bit too wide so that means I can bring up.	O
I think I'll bring down the Top AC.	O
It's doing something funny, OK, so I want to bring down the Top one.	CHITCHAT
But I want to keep it quite fat.	O
So I'm making sure that I'm not bringing the whole thing down just the Top.	O
And that it's staying in it.	O
So back in there.	O
So I might want to do something more kind of.	O
Fluid I don't know.	O
Like.	CHITCHAT
That.	CHITCHAT
For example, But I'm keeping my.	CHITCHAT
Options open here.	CHITCHAT
Because I'm just at the sketch Phase I want to.	CHITCHAT
Feel like I'm.	CHITCHAT
Developing his piece as I go along it that it's actually starting to kind.	CHITCHAT
Direct me of it.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Not really too sure where I'll go.	CHITCHAT
With this text, but the moment, it's really messy scene.	CHITCHAT
And not so nice.	CHITCHAT
But if I had.	CHITCHAT
Not she could do something like connect here or something.	O
I don't know so I'm going to bring that down.	O
So I just know that there's going to be some shape Sir.	CHITCHAT
Let me see when she take that.	CHITCHAT
Opt out that looks very, very different.	CHITCHAT
And once the shapes are in, then I can just take use the last sale and just move a few of them around so for example, if I wanted too.	O
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Bring it up a bit when I'm doing this so that you can actually see it because I guess when it's a bit faded.	O
I'm not sure you're going to see that so well.	CHITCHAT
So then I can kind of start playing with it, so this is super rough.	O
Ann.	CHITCHAT
But there's a piece that I did before I'm going to show you now where I fell in love with.	CHITCHAT
The latter and And it does kind of come to mind.	CHITCHAT
So am I after a just so you can see the letter in here.	O
This isn't this is a small image of it.	O
But what I loved about the latter in here was that.	O
I created these these kind of curved lines for it to work with so there's like a huge amount of movement like if you look.	O
From the right hand side.	O

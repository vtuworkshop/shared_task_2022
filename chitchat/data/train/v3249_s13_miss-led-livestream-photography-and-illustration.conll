Or her right side.	O
See you look down from the rest down and said I like that.	O
A and the D and the end and the Oh like I love that and at the end of the bottom of the other elbow.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
These that's why I'm not creating the lines to specific yet because I like the idea of them working within the peace.	O
Because obviously I had the specifics for this, I knew that there was going to be some over there.	O
I knew that there was going to be letters and arms and they're in that position, so I could really play with the lettering.	O
But I had that position and I kept playing and tweaking and moving them and shaping them maybe about.	CHITCHAT
3 or 4 times until I got it right so it does take time so.	CHITCHAT
This is what we have to solve with.	CHITCHAT
So I just have to deal with this and not think about it, too much, but Luckily.	CHITCHAT
I cannot get back and I don't have to see it so much so I can make these backwards do this a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
For me, it doesn't look right.	CHITCHAT
But the whole idea is to keep moving with this and just not getting too caught up in anything so I'm gonna add some a different color and some more layers.	O
And I'm going to maybe use some green because I will be using green in the peace because it's about growth.	O
You can have some sort of platforms.	O
So yes, there will be great.	CHITCHAT
So let's go in the green now.	O
You welcome funeral.	CHITCHAT

Chat window, when it be cool to chat with no just the chat section and.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to ask me a question about working on or anything else.	CHITCHAT
And I will do my best to answer.	CHITCHAT
Um doing some insane multitasking at the moment I think I can manage some questions.	CHITCHAT
Then you can test me anyway.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going green, so I'm gonna put a green.	O
Hello lines on here and then those lines now that I've got an idea of where I want to put my.	CHITCHAT
Now I've got an idea whether text might be if I use this text.	O
I can start acknowledging that so that's that that's the aim of just getting makes just a shape down.	O
I cannot come right out with my other compositional lines.	O
And because I've got this.	O
Top circle here, which might be a boundary line for.	O
The other word.	O
I know I want to acknowledge not with the.	O
Of mine so I'm going to go bigger for this.	O
I'm staying with the same brush with his contact going.	O
Style brush nickel that bigger.	O
And I want to.	CHITCHAT
Easy is coming.	CHITCHAT
So you can see this sort of texture of.	O
This this brush abit more when it's a bit bigger.	O
Amanda my kids.	CHITCHAT
Right now, the colors on the shirts are bugging me so I might block the shirt in or just put a divide.	O
Not like a mask or anything, but just.	O
Bring that back to this is white kind of color.	O
Kind of messy that's fine will find me.	CHITCHAT
Dark singing and writing it.	CHITCHAT

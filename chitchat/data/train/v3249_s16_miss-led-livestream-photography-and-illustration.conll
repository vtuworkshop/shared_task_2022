It's not quite slotting but.	O
I am not going to be deterrent.	O
We cannot remove it around play a bit more.	O
It's just early so.	CHITCHAT
Keep.	O
That is OK.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Again, I'm going to bring that down.	O
Attach that to the circle so we've got that in a group or fiercely.	O
Circle tax group.	O
Then we can make that.	O
And I decided on the capital letters for example, BIC cause that text will be.	O
Smaller I still wanted it to be a definite so balance out.	O
Uh the size with making it kind of bold so that was my decision for for that.	O
So that's just going to sit at the Top.	O
That for now.	CHITCHAT
And now that I've moved the second piece of text up, I can start using the space inside the Ark.	O
Which I had planned to do?	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
So what I'm going to do now is I'm going to see if I can do some continue doing the?	O
Compositional lines, adding a bit more detail.	O
For another half an hour or so right about half an hour.	CHITCHAT
Then I'm going to take an hour.	CHITCHAT
Break.	CHITCHAT
So that would mean so I will I will probably draw it in about 7 and then I'll put it back on the screen?	CHITCHAT
He said pop back on his dream.	CHITCHAT
I guess you can or hop back you can hop on a call so you could maybe pop in his dream.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I know.	CHITCHAT
So I will be drawing again at 8, but in the mean time.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to work on the sketch a bit more so that we can start I can stop pulling in color and start building up the actual image so that is.	CHITCHAT
The aim.	CHITCHAT
So that's what I'm going to do.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Clean up a little bit.	O
Be cause I now have decided.	CHITCHAT
So we need something to wrap around so it.	O
It's really nice that the piece as it's growing.	CHITCHAT
It's giving me clues, so I keep talking about how if you keep.	CHITCHAT
Playing with different ideas and shapes and colors.	CHITCHAT
It can it can help guide you or it can also direct you feel connected collaborating middle piece.	CHITCHAT
As it's growing then it can give you clues to the next thing basically so if I have a hot air balloon.	O
Then I generally need some cloud right so that is what I'm going to use above the head.	O
But the image of the photograph.	O
And maybe around.	O
The hot air balloon, which isn't actually hot air balloon white chats.	O
I think it needs to stay in that section of the peace.	O
Because it's the first word.	O
It might move around a bit, but the moment if I put the bits in.	O
It's maybe going to be squashed and I'm not no worry too much about that just got the words in there.	O
So I'm going to create an air.	O
And blue.	O
And we have already got a color overlay in blue.	O
Machines that another time, then I'm just going to use that.	O
Also cloud shapes.	O
So what might be nice is how I want to use the cloud.	O
So maybe I want to use the cloud 2.	O

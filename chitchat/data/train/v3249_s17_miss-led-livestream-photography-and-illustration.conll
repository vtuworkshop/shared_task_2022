Create a distance between some of the lines some of the elements.	O
So there could be a cloud behind me.	O
But in front of one of the words or one of the letters just overlapping so you just sort of playing with.	O
This kind of depth now because now that the piece is growing and that you can kind of look at kind of positioning and.	O
Seeing how we can kind of fill that space, but in.	O
The sense of death.	CHITCHAT
I think I explained that.	CHITCHAT
Come labor that.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm just going to put some really basic.	O
Round shapes in.	O
Actually, because I did for the last piece, I did some sort of really cotton monies are globular.	CHITCHAT
Almost Japanese inspired clouds I think I'm gonna go.	CHITCHAT
In the other direction, so I'll start with making a straight line.	O
So I'm using shift for this.	O
Just.	CHITCHAT
To get that straight line.	O
So I'm going to do that kind of cloud so again what I'm doing is looking at something that I've already done and then.	CHITCHAT
It's giving me an idea of how I can move forward.	CHITCHAT
I stressed this just because.	CHITCHAT
There's often times where I get creative blocks or I get a bit stuck on ideas, so that's why I kind of Labor this point and talk about how.	CHITCHAT
Your.	CHITCHAT
You can kind of create create ideas from the piece that you've already done, or something in that series so.	CHITCHAT
You put 2 on same.	O
Layer here, which probably I don't necessarily have to.	O
But I don't wanna end up having like a ton of layers either.	O
I can obviously select them individually and so the place them around so now.	O
I know that I want that shape I can just sort of make move it around like a bit of collage.	O
And see see what?	CHITCHAT
Fits.	O
Um, I'm going to do some research on clouds.	CHITCHAT
I feel like having that strong line.	O
There is maybe feeling a bit sort of sunset.	O
And if it's sunset or sunrise then.	O
Maybe it's not going to have.	O
So it could be quite similar to.	O
The line from before.	O
Which is here?	CHITCHAT
Which could be the sun?	CHITCHAT
Which is setting behind the words so it could work?	CHITCHAT
And it is quite good because I don't have any straight lines in here.	O
I want to have some straight lines.	O
Compositionally and in the elements to just offset all the tennis world, but I'm going to have a look at this when I have a break in a bit and see how I feel about that I can bring this back.	CHITCHAT
Make it smaller.	CHITCHAT
So this son would obviously work with those clouds.	O
I'm gonna know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, pass it out.	CHITCHAT
So it's not.	O
Dominating.	O
Peace too much.	CHITCHAT
Put that There.	O
And then I want some talking about straight lines and put some straight lines.	CHITCHAT

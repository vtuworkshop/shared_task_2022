Uh yes.	CHITCHAT
So you use I see so you do have?	CHITCHAT
You're welcome into us, but not this intik yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think when you go to working directly on a screen like saying using the iPad and then you go back to not working on the screen.	CHITCHAT
It must be it must be a pain, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
There is have you seen the new um.	CHITCHAT

Trying to time, but I found it a bit heavy, and I really struggled, with using?	CHITCHAT

So I'm back with my my huge centriq.	CHITCHAT
And I had a year off using this antique actually.	CHITCHAT

Smaller so I just tried to use my own member everything.	CHITCHAT
And as soon as I started working with Adobe.	CHITCHAT
In doing the live streams as we are here now.	CHITCHAT
My idea is just started to really expand and all these parks started kind of.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, really Sparks went off and I was really excited to work large again to print large again and just I do a lot of work, where I get to a certain point, and maybe have I finished and I stuck.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure so I will then go to my printer, which is a 3 which is really heavily but you can do on any size and then I print the peace out.	CHITCHAT
So I can see it on my wall, but load the white space on it, and then I start to add compositional lines and I start to look at it very differently.	CHITCHAT
I've got a different space.	CHITCHAT
It's not confined to the screen, and I find that really handy.	CHITCHAT
On it, I'm on the right leg.	CHITCHAT
Wicked.	CHITCHAT

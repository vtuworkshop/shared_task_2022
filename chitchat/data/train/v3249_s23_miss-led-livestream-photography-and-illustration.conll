And it's telling me my battery's alone, my keyboard on my gosh.	CHITCHAT
This is not good news.	CHITCHAT
Because my Laptop is there.	CHITCHAT
My screen is here of his fame my mic is here, and keyboard is here and my trackpad is here.	CHITCHAT
So there's no way I can.	CHITCHAT
Grab the keyboard here is my iPods here.	CHITCHAT
I've got all the kits here, I was going to photograph it, but it looked so.	CHITCHAT
Tacky not in a bad way, but it just looked like what am I showing.	CHITCHAT
It's just lots of kids.	CHITCHAT
A lot of unnecessary kit picture.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I need to get all of these in the right group.	O
Oh come on.	CHITCHAT
Oh, right OK, we have to be.	CHITCHAT
K he's just sitting on my head.	CHITCHAT
Just having an arrest.	CHITCHAT
Who is hacking some?	CHITCHAT
Beautiful Flowers.	CHITCHAT
You can see.	CHITCHAT
Slight delay.	CHITCHAT
Oh, he looks good in there.	O
You don't mind me, saying so.	CHITCHAT
Adding something else.	O
That is going to make this.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
So you might go here.	O
He might go.	O
Like this.	O
Booms last night like a shrimp.	CHITCHAT
They know better.	CHITCHAT
I think I got work today on this piece.	CHITCHAT
He's going to be smaller.	O
Let's bring the ampacity up.	O
It's a bit better.	O
I'm just going to put in here.	O
So we've got the text.	O
We've got the lines that are going to the following form.	O
Which are really, really important actually?	O
And these are the lines that are going to help me get an idea and flew for the shape.	O
That will come off the pencil so this is going anywhere in the flower saw an elements kind of coral.	O
And these sort of Smokey lines might just be guides and then or they might be background.	O
So we'll see.	CHITCHAT
And again the bottom lines here, I think I'm like.	O
Want to go classic.	O
Misled with some.	CHITCHAT
Where is that line?	CHITCHAT
Classic misled with some scalloped lines here.	O
Let me see that way too bold at the moment.	O
And maybe that could even come round.	O
I'm going to put that over the divide.	O
To add to just the flowing chaos.	O
I am going to have some shape and color over the shirt.	O
I haven't quite decided it yet.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just going to block the Zen, but I'm going to have a break and stop talking I've been talking for 2 hours.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Plan a bit more behind the scenes.	CHITCHAT
Once having a bite to eat.	CHITCHAT
And then I'm gonna be back on your screen.	CHITCHAT
In an hour, maybe less.	CHITCHAT

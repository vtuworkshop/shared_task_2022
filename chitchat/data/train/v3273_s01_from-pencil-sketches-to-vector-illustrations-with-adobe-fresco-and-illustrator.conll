Yes, yes, let's take a look at what's happening.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you guys are here today.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to work on some sketches.	O
I'm going to work on some vector drawings that I'm going to create from some sketches that I started way back.	O
When and so the key is to.	O
Take something that you already have sketched out on paper or traditional traditional I do have some paintings.	O
That I need to turn into vectors so that might be the next live stream.	O
Yes, yes, I got lots of content.	CHITCHAT
Lots of things that I want to do.	CHITCHAT
But the key is that we can take things that are in a traditional art form and then use the vector brushes in Adobe fresco.	O
And then it turned it into a vector illustration that you can open illustrator and take wherever you want create whatever type of projects that you want to create apparel merchandise banners posters anything and everything.	O
It all counts and so that's the good thing about working with vector brushes is that it allows you the chance to have the artwork set as a vector in illustrator and most vector programs illustrator Top one.	O
OK, I don't care what anybody else, got to say.	CHITCHAT
But it allows you to then use it in many other ways outside of just a digital drawing digital drawing is cool being fancy and showing off what you do on the Internet is good, but you want the time you spent drawing and creating you want to be able to invest that into some apparel or marketing or promotional materials in my case hold up hold up?	CHITCHAT
Let me switch Camera.	CHITCHAT
So you don't know so you know that I'm not leaving.	CHITCHAT
In my case, I have stickers so I make stickers on my work and there goes churi.	CHITCHAT
And then this is one of my characters is hard to see I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
But basically what I do is some of my artwork.	CHITCHAT
I turn it into stickers.	CHITCHAT
So, there, you go alright.	CHITCHAT

I don't know alright so let's go ahead and get to it, and you can't see either from this angle either.	CHITCHAT
But I got a ton of stuff over here in front of me in, including a surface.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to be drawn on the Surface Pro 7.	O
It is the newest surface out there.	CHITCHAT
It's a good machine.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to be using my.	O
Surface Pen was really cool what I was on Reddit when I saw somebody talk about how.	O
Ah, how they took the that the end from one pan and put it on another an now.	CHITCHAT
You gotta cool.	CHITCHAT
Lookin pen right so, so that's that's neat I like that.	CHITCHAT
Also my pants, I add the this grip that I get off of cheap in that you may find in a hotel or some kind of marketing event, you go to and I just added I just slip it onto the pin to the Surface Pen and now I got a grip.	CHITCHAT
I need to be able to draw without having to squeeze my fingers really tight to control the pen.	CHITCHAT
Alright so let me show you my computer screen.	CHITCHAT
This is the Surface Pro 7.	CHITCHAT
I need to put my glasses on there.	CHITCHAT
We go and I gotta take off the keyboard.	CHITCHAT
If Tamika still around she is for you to make anybody else who uses sketchable to draw a fan.	CHITCHAT
Some ways to clear a selection.	CHITCHAT
So you make a selection in the layer and then you can clear it but you need a keyboard.	CHITCHAT
And then also found a way to copy and paste and you don't need a keyboard for that part but you can make a selection copy and then hit the paste and bam is some new layer an it has that whatever it is that you selected on a whole new layer and it still has the same part that you selected in that original layer, so there's a couple cool things happening with sketchable, but we're here for Adobe fresco.

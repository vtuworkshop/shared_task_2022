The cool thing about fresco.	O
Doby fresco is that you're working in vector brushes, though the size of the document.	O
It really doesn't matter as much.	O
But matters what you're going to be concerned with is really going to be that orientation where there is portrait or landscape.	O
So let's go ahead and click on our picture icon in the left hand side.	O
Go through our files and I have.	CHITCHAT
This is my drop box where everything lives.	CHITCHAT

It's on one of the layers.	O
But we're not done.	O
I can still resize this, if I want to can click on grab one of the corners and size it up or down.	O
An rotated if I want to rotate it.	O
I don't care for much for any of that right now.	O
I'm cool with the size and I click on done on the Top right boom.	O
Pinch and zoom working with Adobe fresco is just like every other digital program.	O
It's the cool thing about fresco and what Adobe's been doing is that it started off as an iPad only program called Gemini Project, Gemini and now it's it's also available on the surface.	O
If you don't have a surface you need to get one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, sorry alright so on Top right.	O
We have a way to click on our layer properties as the little icon with the with the dials on the right hand side and I can turn down the opacity a little bit.	O
That's a good number.	CHITCHAT
I can click and drag.	O
The layer so I can change the order.	O
I select my Top layer, which is blank and on the left hand side.	O
I'm going to grab my vector brushes so there.	O
It is, is the 3rd icon on the bottom on the Top.	O
Left of the screen.	O
And you can see, there's different type of vector brushes.	O
I'm just going to click, and drag that out, so that it stays put I can sexually set it over here.	O

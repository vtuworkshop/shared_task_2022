Now the one cool thing is that of course, you can change colors.	O
It's right here on the left hand side change your color an when you start using the new color.	O
It starts to add library starts to add up right here on the most recent on the bottom.	O
Also was cool is that you can get your paint bucket.	O
And then select some other lines that you've already done and change that color you see that's very cool.	O
Go back to the vector brush and there, you have it.	O
I like it, I'm just going to play around we're here to play around.	CHITCHAT
A Hideaway my layers by clicking on that layer icon and then start.	O
Drawing here.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Nice so big fat lines.	O
For the outline.	O
But dinner lines for the detail.	CHITCHAT
There is a you know what the The On the iPad.	O
I think they have have updated the app fresco to turn off the touch function for.	O
For drawing because one thing that happens is that when you tap on the screen, you end up with these.	O
Marks and then you two finger tap to undo and sometimes you two finger tap by mistake.	O
When you click down and drag and move around and it registers as an undo when it should not be an undo.	O
So it's a few little edits and changes have been happening uh there.	O
There's uh.	CHITCHAT
The Adobe fresco is always is currently under development.	O
Still, there's new updates.	O
All the time and I get to play with some of those updates.	CHITCHAT
I don't play with the.	CHITCHAT
IPad updates us much.	CHITCHAT
Because I really enjoy drawing with the surface.	CHITCHAT
I need Apple give me some money, I'll draw on the.	CHITCHAT
I passed the mini iPad.	CHITCHAT
Give me some money I'll do it.	CHITCHAT
Just kidding not really.	CHITCHAT
Alright Here we go there, it is just like that.	CHITCHAT
Just drawing just leaning drop in the pen on the glass leaning very lightly, so that I can.	O
Control the pressure.	O
Without straining one thing that's going to happen on that is, when you draw digitally is that you strain.	O
Your hand.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
And that's because this glass if you're cool, you got a rubber tip on your pen.	CHITCHAT
If you're not cool, you need to get you a rubber tip.	CHITCHAT
It's feels.	CHITCHAT
Easier to draw with when you have.	CHITCHAT
A different type tip other than that plastic heart itch tip that.	CHITCHAT
On.	CHITCHAT
The Apple pencil an the Surface Pen counts with.	CHITCHAT
There we go?	CHITCHAT
I don't like those little pieces, there, but it's going to do.	O
Is going to do for now?	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
This was this was that's what I'm thinking about right now, let me undo this.	O
With cool thing about the Surface Pen, I can turn around the pen.	CHITCHAT
And Ban look I use the eraser Surface Pen has an eraser.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Get rid of those things could get good now let's go here.	O
Huh.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Do a draw, it like you mean it.	O
Not like that line fixed.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Nice I like it here we go.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
I am Like this.	CHITCHAT
Very cool, one thing about the xans is that these vector this vector brushes that you know it ends in Point is so sometimes you know you don't want to see that point you want to kind of just see this whole line be solid and consistent.	O
And so that means that you're going to have to draw over it a couple times.	O
So I can, but I start like at this end right here and then go there and then go there and then go here, but now that's too thick.	O

So a long time ago, I used to draw like this.	CHITCHAT
A lot of my graffiti and I called the Bony style 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I just draw a lot of skulls so I my schools always have like a whole bunch of detail in curves and an twists.	CHITCHAT
Add in an RC Niska before and realize I don't know really how they are, but I just imagine you know.	CHITCHAT
Bones having all these.	CHITCHAT
Hard edges and folds.	CHITCHAT
Play Miguel.	CHITCHAT
And one thing about drawing in general, but especially digital art.	CHITCHAT
And I kinda teach tattooing so I've been talking about this with my.	CHITCHAT
One of my tattoo students.	CHITCHAT
Is that UM?	CHITCHAT
You want to follow and let me go ahead change.	CHITCHAT
You want to make sure that your hand follows the natural curve.	O
You know intern and pivot of your wrist so you want your lines to bring to come towards you and you want to start a line on this side like this and then use your hand elbow shoulder to bring it down this way.	O
So you always drawing tours.	CHITCHAT
You like that.	CHITCHAT
That's very natural if you start doing things like this and then going up.	O
And then twisting around an on in following that line wherever it may lead you end up hurting your wrist a lot.	O
A lot of strain alot of finger strain and that it makes it makes digital drawing.	O
Nestle enjoyable so you want to make sure you have.	CHITCHAT
You artwork gone your hand movement following the artwork but make sure that you move the artwork around so that your hand is doing this motion.	O
So like with this drawing.	O
I just sit there and twisted I twisted around Alene my Palm on the glass or.	O
Screen an bam.	O
Let's see do I like that line is too thick?	O
And I just leaned the pen.	O
And that was too thick also.	O
Emma.	CHITCHAT

Don't strain your hand trying to follow a bunch of weird lines 'cause then.	O
Um there, we go bam.	CHITCHAT

I need one machine that I'm not going to.	O
Be a Save in my work too much into it from what I know Adobe fresco is free.	O
There are some limitations, but it's free.	O
Is the freeing is free?	CHITCHAT
I think it's a some of the limitations are the exporting?	O
It doesn't allow for some of the exports.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Not going to tell you what you should or should not have it all depends on your process on your purpose why?	CHITCHAT
The you need Adobe fresco is it even useful to you.	CHITCHAT

As part of my creative process is not.	CHITCHAT

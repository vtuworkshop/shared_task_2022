The.	CHITCHAT
Adobe fresco is not where I finished artwork.	O
It's where I am halfway.	O
Into the artwork the beginning of my artwork starts with a sketch, either in pencil in real life, I got tons of sketchbooks.	O
Um or It's about uhm.	CHITCHAT
Digital sketching with sketchable with our.	CHITCHAT
There we go yes.	CHITCHAT
With where am I awesome in the front of the letter D.	CHITCHAT
I can't even sketch with our photo shop, you know.	CHITCHAT
Yes, there's lots of other sketching programs and so on.	CHITCHAT
The point is that you start with a sketch.	O
I start with the idea and then you take that idea from there.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
And without my process with Adobe fresco is that now I can draw with vector brushes in a draw.	O
My designs that I want them to be vector.	O
But I draw them with these vector brushes so that when I go into illustrator.	O
It's already vector Indiana.	O
I don't have to use the pen tool.	O
I love the pen tool.	CHITCHAT
But an I love.	CHITCHAT
The blob brush, but when it comes to you know natural feeling organic drawing.	O
You want Adobe fresco, I've done the organic drawing on Adobe illustrator look at that.	O
That is awesome.	CHITCHAT
Of done the.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can do this here.	O
I've done the digital vector drawing with the blob brush and it's nice.	O
Except that Adobe Illustrator is very Top heavy program and So what it does is it has a lag has this big lag on it, it starts to.	O
It starts to.	CHITCHAT
Slow down machine down because illustrator is not made for that as much as I love illustrator on my illustrator.	O
Junkie is not made for that.	CHITCHAT
Ansol then it starts to have this lag slows down the machine and next thing you know boom.	CHITCHAT
It's uh.	CHITCHAT

Sorry guys I'm in I haven't not been lie within a maker on be hands in a minute.	CHITCHAT
So that's my process that's what I like to do.	O
That's why I use fresco for the kind of projects that I want to have to be vector.	O
But I want him to also have a organic clean look not as harsh as the pencil in.	O
I still use a pencil for many other things, an in part of the projects but.	O
With some of my drawings like this, I want that very clean organic.	O
Looking.	O

What happened to that darkness there we go?	CHITCHAT
I just drew on whatever I could draw.	CHITCHAT
And copy paper was my number one.	CHITCHAT
A source.	CHITCHAT
Of paper.	CHITCHAT
Get 500 pages right 500 sheets of paper and draw on that.	CHITCHAT
And I thought I thought that was cool and it's cool, it's cool, but as time goes on.	CHITCHAT
You know, I would have conversations with other artists and it's telling me about this sketchbook and that new scheduling like?	CHITCHAT
What are you talking about?	CHITCHAT
And it has been money on a couple sketchbooks and then I would worship those schedules like Oh no this schedule come just going to draw this one kind of thing and this other sketchbook.	CHITCHAT
I'm only going to draw in pencil's in this schedule going only going to draw in inks.	CHITCHAT
To make it says I like to decorate the outside of my sketchbooks, so I can keep track keep track of Watt.	CHITCHAT
Of which sketchbook is which yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I decorate my sketchbooks with stickers.	CHITCHAT
But as time went on, I realized you know what the sketchbook is to sketch that's why it's called sketchbook.	CHITCHAT
It's a It's a place where you dump your ideas and sketch amount.	CHITCHAT
Because you're going to forget you going to forget that idea.	CHITCHAT
You're going to forget what will spark that inspiration later when you actually have time and so the schedule gets kind of a keeper like Tamika says to keep track.	CHITCHAT
Um keep track of your thoughts and ideas and inspirations that day, so that later when you have time you can come back and be like, Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
This was a good idea right here that I sketched out an you sketch enough of it just to get a reminder about what the drawing is about what was the idea about don't don't overdraw you can finish drawings and sketchbooks, but do not spend a lot of time.	CHITCHAT
Yep, there, it is that's right Tamika.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of time trying to get an idea out your head an into perfect.	CHITCHAT
Rendering.	CHITCHAT
When when unless you have the time for it if you have time then you do that.	CHITCHAT
But if you don't Hey listen, just get that idea out.	CHITCHAT
Let us get that get that idea to declutter your mind your brain your inspiration, Visual Journal.	CHITCHAT
Yes, a visual Journal get it out and then then.	CHITCHAT
Come back to it when you have time and, yes, the visual Journal, Hey.	CHITCHAT
At Tinajero 00540.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for joining in the conversation.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, Tamika says the Visual Journal.	CHITCHAT
Yep, it's like a like a diary.	CHITCHAT
Were you thinking about your life and things that happen in your life?	CHITCHAT
And so you want to remember certain things, positive things negative things you want to work through some struggles and frustrations.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm a key character sketches an rough sketches for children's book layout.	CHITCHAT
Yes, there, we go that's right.	CHITCHAT
That's right for your work indeed.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's your work that's the job will then that's what you put on the sketchbooks.	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Things that I do a lot of our client.	CHITCHAT
Drawings are asked error.	CHITCHAT
On the sketching face when I'm thinking of the idea through I put it do it on schedules and I do it little so the key to that Indiana Tamika May.	CHITCHAT
Add to that, too, is that you want to sketch when you thinking of projects and like children's books or client artwork.	CHITCHAT
You sketch and little small pieces.	CHITCHAT
And the page so that you don't over think the detail just get the shape out get the shape get the layout get the composition out so that you have something to build on later in right now.	CHITCHAT
You just focus on one aspect of one part of your process.	CHITCHAT
Don't get too caught up because then.	CHITCHAT
You want to be able to give yourself more options for that sketch more options for that layout more options.	CHITCHAT
And so and so, if you focus too long into one other sketch ideas.	CHITCHAT
Your your commit too much to it to want to change later, whereas if you try.	CHITCHAT
Lots of different ideas.	CHITCHAT
You can step back and take a look like well.	CHITCHAT
At first I wasn't feeling it, but later on, I was OK and by the time I got to thirst catch that was exactly what I'm looking for you gotta just spell it out spell it out spell it out.	CHITCHAT
Rough sketches yes rough sketching.	CHITCHAT
And that's what the letter D was that if you can notice if you notice here.	O

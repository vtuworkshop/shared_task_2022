My letter Dean.	O
Let me see if I can turn that off for now turn this back up.	O
There's a 2 layers of pencil markings here, there's a light blue and a darker purple.	O
And so when I was drawing this.	O
I did some very rough, sketching with the blue was like cool.	O
I want to D Letter D?	O
That's 2017 right there, she shows a year.	O
I was doing some real rough rough rough and it's like Oh kind of like that.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like that little Bony style there.	CHITCHAT
So then it came back with a purple pencil.	O
An I cleaned up some of the line work and I did not follow all the lines the way they were.	O
But I use them as guys instead of closing that Letter D right there with that were that blue is and the purple.	O
I readjusted and made it look like it was broken off or something right and if it was really cool.	O
I would have done like a an extra.	CHITCHAT
Let me turn that back on what I should have done right here is like Donna.	O
Part where it looks like it is chunked out.	O
The chunk fell off.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And so then let me do this on the line here.	O
Right and so now so now it looks like that chunk came off the letter D.	O
Yeah, yeah, and even at the Indian states, which we would call this sinking.	O
I am still making adjustments in changing things.	O
Yeah, let me fix that.	O
Move I want to get rid of that circle there, we go bone.	O
Let's go.	CHITCHAT
Air.	O
So yeah, um.	CHITCHAT
Rough is what you want.	O
But you know, then there are sketch books that I really big I got all sizes.	CHITCHAT
And sometimes you do want to finish a rendering in a sketchbook why not?	CHITCHAT
Do what you want.	CHITCHAT
I think really is.	CHITCHAT
The key is that not to get stuck on one thing.	CHITCHAT
Do what you want, but don't get stuck into like all this drawn has to be perfect.	CHITCHAT
And what I like about digital as you can see is that can I can draw the line over and over and they until I get it right?	CHITCHAT
I see this is a crazy long line, so let me see if I can do.	O
There it is.	O
All right now.	CHITCHAT
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
Lightly and drawing very lightly.	O
'Cause I don't want really fat lines.	O
I don't want that and I could make adjustments in my line with but.	O
Line stroke.	O
I don't feel like it.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to keep drawing with this there, we go so let's go.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, just moving through slowly.	O
Now this you know this is a personal project right here just a personal illustration.	CHITCHAT
If it was a client illustration.	CHITCHAT
I gotta move not faster, but I have a whole plan, an idea ready and so I need to move through that idea whereas here right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm experimenting getting a feel for it.	CHITCHAT
Like Yeah, that's cool.	CHITCHAT
That's cool let's go ahead and turn off that.	O
Original layer look at that yeah, yeah that is cool come on, I'll tell me is not cool huh.	O
Let me change the name of this are here, we go right, there boom.	O

And so when I click out so let me do a screenshot as a matter of fact should have been doing some screenshots but.	O
I'm crazy, I forget.	CHITCHAT
I forget to do screenshots.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Nice to that.	CHITCHAT
Do screenshots so that you can document your process document your work.	O
There we go is that better that's kind of better I'm so.	CHITCHAT
In any case, once you're at a particular place in your drawing what you wanted to before you even closeout.	O
The document you go to publish an export export there.	O
It is the name Scully D right on the Top left on the bottom left where my face, is that let me see if I turn that off can you see it now, so you can see it 'cause it's further down it says export so on the right below versus Cali D.	O

Crazy with effects right with these settings here.	O
The properties and so on, and start doing different blending modes because then when it's time to export as a PDF is not everything is going to translate so just if you have some things that you want to see and do.	O
Wait till you get out to illustrator and do it and of course, you got gradients in illustrator.	O

Affinity for an open Internet affinity designer my affinity for vector artwork comes from the frustration and pain.	CHITCHAT
And creating artwork in a traditional format with pencils and markers depends not so much with markers and ink to where you can't erase you can't undo you can't.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I make adjustments once the ink is down put the incline down that's it.	CHITCHAT

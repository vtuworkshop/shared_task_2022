Hello Hey, how's it going?	CHITCHAT
Let's see hold on?	CHITCHAT
Launch.	CHITCHAT
Turn it up a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I want some of the vad back some of the video on demand from yesterday back and I didn't notice too much like of that droning bass that I thought there was so we're probably OK.	CHITCHAT
I see that it's like registering a little bit down there.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know what is it just seems like my audio settings of a been changed a little bit somehow.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Today we're going to be working on some more.	O
Of our DND trading cards.	O
Hopefully, that sounds like something you guys would be interested in because that's what we're doing today?	CHITCHAT
And I'm going back to an older.	O
An older design that I had when I just started actually this is one of my first concepts for a DND trading card.	O
Music really loud is just mean.	CHITCHAT
Where is a good level?	CHITCHAT
How 'bout?	CHITCHAT
About right here.	CHITCHAT
Is it going to jump up?	CHITCHAT
I think it will.	CHITCHAT
I just want to get this balance, good before I get started.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I thought about a couple of things for these trading card ideas and one of those things.	O
I thought about was breaking up the cards into different types of card.	O
I don't know how else to say that basically spells creatures items things like that.	CHITCHAT
And the first of which was I don't know if it really be a spell, maybe like abilities could be like a second class.	O
It's probably good to keep things more simple in a trading card game, but spell storm arrowstorm rather.	O
And the idea here is that the character would just cast a volley of arrows down whether they were like you know ETH role or or whatever.	O
I'm not really sure, but that was kind of the concept.	CHITCHAT
I had a bit of a hard time.	CHITCHAT
Thinking about this for a couple of reasons.	CHITCHAT
One of which was the perspective in the proportions of the character is not super great at doing the proportions, but I think that it's like fairly clean fairly tight, so I'm just going to play around this a little bit and see what we can come up with I'm going to be on for about 2 hours.	O
Today, maybe 1, 1/2.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really certain yet.	CHITCHAT
There was one stream that went on for about 1/2 hour extra and just wanna maybe clean that up a little bit.	CHITCHAT
So here we are.	CHITCHAT
It's Sunday.	CHITCHAT
It's almost 2:00 PM for me here and I'm going to start working on.	CHITCHAT
On this thing.	CHITCHAT
Uh it should be a pretty straightforward thing.	O
Foreground middle ground background character.	O
Post processing effects and then ultimately the line art.	O
I think will end up finishing with the line art.	O
And I think we'll be alright.	CHITCHAT
I'm listening to this Realty free playlist and it's a little bit too.	CHITCHAT
Nightcore for me.	CHITCHAT
So I'll skip ahead a little bit and see if any of them get a little bit less.	CHITCHAT
Now these are a little bit, too much.	CHITCHAT
Let's try this one out.	CHITCHAT
OK, how about this one.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there, we go, some jazz and you guys you guys like jazz, hopefully you do.	CHITCHAT
I think what I'd like to do is try out some of the brushes that I made yesterday.	O
And see if those will be affective for what I want to do.	O
Zoom in a little bit here and see what we can come up with I've not used these at all.	CHITCHAT
Since yesterday so.	CHITCHAT
Let's see how they turn out.	CHITCHAT
I think I'll leave my sketch fairly sketchy.	O
And I'll focus mostly on getting the colors.	O
First of all.	O
And really I want to start with a bit of a wash.	O
I like to get a wash to.	O
Really?	CHITCHAT
Solidify.	O
My objects.	O
And that textures really shown is Annette.	O
Let's try a different brush.	O
Let's try one of the other brushes, I made?	O
Let's take a look at like.	CHITCHAT
About how about this one.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit better.	O
Of course, as we start stacking on colors and stuff, it will start to take shape I think.	O
Similar to the other one, I want to kind of focus warmer colors towards this middle here.	O
And kind of push those values out as we get to the edge of the canvas here.	O

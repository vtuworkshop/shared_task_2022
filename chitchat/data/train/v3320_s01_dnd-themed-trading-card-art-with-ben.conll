I do kind of like the way that this brushes texture comes through it looks really canvas when she guys agree.	O
Oh, Hey before we get too far into this.	CHITCHAT
I want to say a couple of thank youse Bruno.	CHITCHAT
Safa Maria and Sean.	CHITCHAT
Thank you guys for fall in my work I appreciate you.	CHITCHAT
Feel free if you guys are in the chat watching remember this is alive video so if you have any questions or thoughts or you just want to say hello.	CHITCHAT
Could feel totally free to do that.	CHITCHAT
One thing to note.	CHITCHAT
I have changed.	CHITCHAT
Some of the color settings on my monitors and I'm hoping that.	CHITCHAT
It will be an improvement.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping that my colors will get a little bit better today.	CHITCHAT
Not really certain, though I hope so.	CHITCHAT
Want to get some foreground elements here.	CHITCHAT
I'm really liking the way this brush looks actually.	CHITCHAT
I'm not too sure how to huddle do for.	CHITCHAT
Like more tighter details but so far.	CHITCHAT
I think this is looking kind of nice.	CHITCHAT
I want to get more of a dynamic range.	CHITCHAT
Of Richard tones here.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I'm kinda visioning like a maybe a bit of like A.	CHITCHAT
A dungeon floor.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should really focus on my context, a bit more before I get too far into these but.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I often feel like I'm.	CHITCHAT
Kind of always ahead of myself on this kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
I want this to really feel.	CHITCHAT
It's in the foreground.	CHITCHAT
How are y'all doing this this afternoon?	CHITCHAT
You're doing well.	CHITCHAT
We're getting a pretty good sense of.	O
Depth here, I think.	O
I want to make sure that this.	O
This feels like it's further back, though.	O
I kind of have it that the character is sad to little below eye level.	O
And that the this, this line here.	CHITCHAT
This line right here.	O
Is is like a distortion of like a fish eye lens so you can kind of see the?	O
The floor obscuring.	O
The foreground character there.	O
That's kind of what I want to try to communicate with this and I think once I start to tighten up the line art and get the painting a little bit more solidified that will be easier to do.	O
But I want to see how much I can get out of that from the very beginning.	O
And I think it will help that is.	O
Getting some higher higher lighted values.	O
Right around here.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
I think this will workout.	CHITCHAT
How do you guys feel about this about this texture on the brush so far?	CHITCHAT
Are you guys liking that?	CHITCHAT
Those are direct results from the brush stream from yesterday.	O
And I'm feeling optimistic personally, I think it looks kind of nice.	O
Of course, like I said, I'm not sure how.	O
The fine details will be conveyed here since the texture being applied is.	O
Is so large it will be tough to get past that?	O
This is coming along like fairly nicely actually I want to get some.	O
Softer highlights back here.	O
This is where I want the character in the background to be in focus.	O
Maybe just get some.	O
Varisoft parks here.	O
I feel like this is actually really pushing the.	CHITCHAT
The look of my.	CHITCHAT
Someone said awhile back a couple streams back that.	CHITCHAT
My flats remind them a little bit of like classic oil paintings in some ways.	CHITCHAT
And I'm hoping that I can push that a little bit.	CHITCHAT
With this new brush that I made.	CHITCHAT
Because I think that's a really cool thing, especially when you're making.	CHITCHAT

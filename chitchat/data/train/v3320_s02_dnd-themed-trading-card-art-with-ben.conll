Dandy themed trading cards, as you want to kind of convey that fantasy fantastical.	CHITCHAT
Look you know.	CHITCHAT
I really don't think I could have achieved.	CHITCHAT
A base painting like this.	CHITCHAT
With the brushes I was using before I really feel like the the brushes is really coming through here.	CHITCHAT
I just I feel like I've been inspired by the values and.	CHITCHAT
And the textures of the brush in a way that I couldn't be couldn't be before.	CHITCHAT
I want to get some greens in here, too just some very.	O
Gentle.	O
Mystical greens that are going to be associated with this spell here.	O
I want them to feel kind of bright and magical and throw in some ways.	O
Get some higher sets in here too.	O
I kind of feel like these arrows entirely should almost be magical.	O
Just this glow.	O
Like that.	CHITCHAT
Something like this perhaps.	CHITCHAT
Let's make a new layer.	O
I don't like to overcome over over commit to a single layer.	O
'Cause when you start making mistakes.	O
You have to come back yourself out of a hole.	O
That really shouldn't have been created in the 1st place so.	O
Let's back this off quite a bit.	O
There we go.	O
I really like this so far?	CHITCHAT
What do you guys think?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll get a little bit more of agloe fringe around the sides here and I want to make sure that there's some cast like too.	O
Because these spells are nice and Glowy and look really cool right so I'm going to make sure that we get.	O
Good better glow coming off of these arrows here.	O
How's that look?	CHITCHAT
Coming together.	O
Almost like a solid white.	O
Inner glow here.	O
And this texture is really nice isn't it?	O
It's a bit repetitive, but I don't think it's so repetitive that it distracts you just yet.	O
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Maybe just off another Oh no drawing on the wrong layer.	CHITCHAT
To what extent?	CHITCHAT
OK, there, we go let's lock this.	O
When in doubt Lockyer layers.	O
But yeah, this is this is coming along really quickly.	CHITCHAT
Quickly getting character.	CHITCHAT
And I think of.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I feel like a large part of that is because of the.	CHITCHAT
The texture of the brush.	CHITCHAT
It's got me inspired.	CHITCHAT
I'll quit talking about the brushes now I'm sure you guys have heard enough already.	CHITCHAT
And I think the texture is a little bit.	O
You know, Wiley, it's a bit much, so I might back it off a little bit as I start to refine the piece as a whole.	O
I want to bring out a little bit more shape of these arrows here, I come look a little bit tighter.	O
Really make him look like they're coming from from above as well.	O
I really love this, this green.	CHITCHAT
I think it really suits the look of the.	CHITCHAT
Spell here.	CHITCHAT
It might be pushing it a little bit, too far, though right now.	O
Let's back that off a little bit.	O
I should start pulling you guys and see if any of you play DND as well.	CHITCHAT
And if you do if you have any favorite favorite cards or spell.	CHITCHAT
Ora not really cards.	CHITCHAT
'cause the cards don't really exist, yet, but if you have any favorite items rather.	CHITCHAT
There any favorite items that you have in the game.	CHITCHAT
If I can manage to.	CHITCHAT
Create those.	CHITCHAT
Alright these aren't bad colors, but they're starting to start to get a little bit weak.	O

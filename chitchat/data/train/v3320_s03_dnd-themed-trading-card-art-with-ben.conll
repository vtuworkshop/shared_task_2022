So I've got to start.	O
Enhancing that a little bit.	O
Or losing some of the.	O
Some of the elements I think.	O
OK, I think it's time to change brushes now.	O
Let's take a look at this one.	CHITCHAT
I want to start bringing out the yeah, there, we go.	CHITCHAT
Start to bring out some of those vibrant whites.	O
And get some of those glows pushed as well.	O
Wanted to feel a bit glory.	O
I'm getting a little bit of reflection off my display as well.	CHITCHAT
Let's just move that a little bit.	O
I want these to feel a little bit more slender.	O
So we have to push his negative space, A little bit more I think.	O
Or I can do that I want to.	O
Get these trajectories feeling alright.	O
It's a bit weird because I wanted to feel like there's just been a spatter avaros shot at the ground.	O
But to do that.	O
I want to try to change like the rotation and the and the attack trajectory and the angle of the of the errors individually.	O
But that does kind of make it so that the paths are a bit skewed.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
Having like 1 major one in the foreground seems like a good idea.	O
Just give that one a much more stark look.	O
Not.	CHITCHAT
Make it look kind of Smokey.	O
A bit more ethereal.	O
Looks Alright.	CHITCHAT
What do you guys think is it a little bit too messy is the idea is still there do you guys have any opinions on that, so far.	CHITCHAT
It's looking alright, but there is a little bit.	O
Getting lost in there.	O
But I can use that brush.	O
How do I always see?	CHITCHAT
I don't know how to make it.	O
Into an eraser as well because you can see that these have a little brush icon next to him, which means that they're locked to being a brush so I don't know how to toggle that that's kind of frustrating.	O
I'll just have to use my airbrush, perhaps how 'bout my wide a textured brush will try this one out.	O
This isn't a custom brush this is one that I.	O
Found somewhere.	O
Want to try to get some more identity in these individual Aeros and on Top of that.	O
David Hey, thanks man how you doing?	CHITCHAT
I think I want to darken the background.	O

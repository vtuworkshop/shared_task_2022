A little bit more just over here.	O
I think I was using this brush.	O
Let's bring it some darker values.	O
I don't think that's the same one you know which ones are using.	O
Is this that's right?	CHITCHAT
Because I think that the values were too similar.	O
So bye.	CHITCHAT
Pushing these back down.	O
I should be able to get some more.	O
Contrast going.	O
This feels like really weird like Super Paper Mario music doesn't it?	CHITCHAT
What is this from?	CHITCHAT
It's more Reds in there.	O
I think the Reds will contrast nicely with these greens.	O
Thanks, man, yeah, I hope it's hope it's fun.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to be both like.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't say that it's educational but maybe if people are new they can sort of pick up some of my techniques, not to say that my techniques are terribly refined but.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully just anything that I cannot.	CHITCHAT
Do to be engaging or or interesting or just share some inspiration.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that would be pretty cool, too.	CHITCHAT
David don't take this don't think that this is a weird thing to do.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to take a brief look at your profile and I'd appreciate some of the stuff.	CHITCHAT
You got going.	CHITCHAT
I think it's really fun too.	CHITCHAT
To share Well, there's some nice photos man.	CHITCHAT
Iceland sorry I just I think I would is it OK if I share this.	CHITCHAT
I think it's fun to have.	CHITCHAT
Wow, these are Super Cool man.	CHITCHAT
I feel like Behance is a platform where people should be able to feel comfortable sharing their stuff with other people in and if you don't mind me sharing your profile man I'll do it.	CHITCHAT
I think it's really fascinating to see whether people work on.	CHITCHAT
I must been really fun trip.	CHITCHAT
That's fantastic.	CHITCHAT
I've been up to this point, mostly been going onto the discover page to share.	CHITCHAT
What other people are working on?	CHITCHAT
But if I can get actual people who were hanging out in the chat and watching to share their stuff too.	CHITCHAT
It feels a lot more engaging I think.	CHITCHAT
OK, we're going to take a brief look at David's work here.	CHITCHAT
I was looking through his Iceland Post and that's Super Nice.	CHITCHAT
Let me just give that appreciation.	CHITCHAT
I wonder David did you go to Iceland for the sake of taking photos or did you just take photos because you were there.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about going to isolate myself a couple maybe about a year ago.	CHITCHAT
I was able to find some reasonably cheap flights, but I wasn't quite together enough to go and commit to that.	CHITCHAT
There was a one of these in particular that was really.	CHITCHAT
And quite gone to this.	CHITCHAT
This is such a cool composition.	CHITCHAT
I need to get done with my with my current.	CHITCHAT
Peace here, but It's really great.	CHITCHAT
Photography such a fun thing it's really tough to get good at it, though.	CHITCHAT
I guess the thing that's that could be said about anything, though really.	CHITCHAT
Just takes awhile to get good at it.	CHITCHAT
Like digital art.	CHITCHAT
And how I don't feel like I'm quite where I should be.	CHITCHAT
How do I make these a little bit more?	CHITCHAT
Just push it over here, a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I feel like Iceland's a good option, too because.	CHITCHAT
If you're in the US, it looks like you are.	CHITCHAT
You can find uh I think I was seeing some plane tickets for about $150.	CHITCHAT
If you want to.	CHITCHAT
If you want to rough it if you want to rough it out.	O
I want to manage this arrow here.	O
That'll probably workout let's start working on the actual Archer himself in the background here.	O

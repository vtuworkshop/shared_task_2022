Put that on the layer below.	O
And I'll start blocking out I guess some basic.	O
Basic values.	O
I don't want to stray too far from like a pretty standard looking.	O
Fantasy themed character so I'll start with just like.	O
Maybe like typically Archers and ranged weapon users go for like lighter.	O
Leathery armor.	O
At least that's what runescape taught Maine.	CHITCHAT
So let's go for something like this and maybe get some.	CHITCHAT
I don't know something like a bit of a cloth.	CHITCHAT
I'll try to keep these shapes pretty simple and keep the overall read of the character fairly simple as well.	O
The major focus is going to be the Aeros and the actual spell that's happening here.	O
So I don't really want to draw that attention, too far away from it.	O
Let's get some like.	O
Boots.	O
And again I do want to make sure to keep this line here occluding the character himself in the back there.	O
So I'll try to go for a fairly hard edge.	O
Let's look at all right.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually really surprised with these brushes.	CHITCHAT
These are the brushes that I made yesterday on stream and they're they're doing alright job actually.	O
The texture feels really nice.	O
And I feel like I can still get hard lines without looking too.	O
Odd.	O
Do we want to give the Sky like a bit of a tunic?	O
Or like a little bit of a skirt kind of thing going on.	O
That's a pretty common thing to have.	CHITCHAT
But maybe it won't go quite to that extent.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it'll just be like.	CHITCHAT
Something like Like this.	CHITCHAT
We have this kind of hang off the edge here.	O
And then give him some belts how does that sound?	CHITCHAT
Give me some belts.	O
Filling my my.	CHITCHAT
The the perspective the proportions the anatomy on this guy is rapidly falling apart.	O
Let's try to push these back a little bit more.	O
OK, I think it's going to be alright.	CHITCHAT
Make that even darker actually.	O
Just go like that.	CHITCHAT
These are blending really nicely.	O
I'm surprised that my first brushes so usable already.	CHITCHAT
I really should have gone with a multiply layer for this, though I think.	O
Not usually enthusiastic about these shadows.	CHITCHAT
I don't know about these Purples you know.	CHITCHAT

Let's maybe push these a little bit more towards the Reds.	O
Just here.	O
OK let's go ahead and just make a new layer instead of to multiply for the sake of simplicity.	O
This will keep my shadows consistent with the lighting as well.	O
You're liking it so far man I hope so outfit is looking good.	CHITCHAT
This one's actually looking fairly distinct compared to the other ones.	CHITCHAT
I think so.	CHITCHAT
Far and that might be primarily because of the of the new brush.	CHITCHAT
It does have a bit of a signature look to it.	CHITCHAT
It might be a bit too early to make final assessments, though.	CHITCHAT
I really like just kind of blotting out.	CHITCHAT
General shapes and ideas.	CHITCHAT
As opposed to.	CHITCHAT
Going for the full on.	CHITCHAT
Full on details if you know what I mean?	CHITCHAT
Alright let's turn back on this and start grabbing some flesh tones.	O
This will be all pretty dark because well, he's in a fairly dark environment.	O
So I can probably.	CHITCHAT
It's fairly dark values.	O
And then the spots were light will hit I'll make fairly high contrast as well.	O
Not like this.	O
I want to make sure that it's.	O
Distinct enough from the background, though.	O
This is a bit tough.	O
Just kind of losing his head, though let's get that head drawn in there.	O
It's going to be this color and.	O
It's on the right layer.	O
Such a bad way of doing that I really should have.	O
On the face first, but I think we'll be alright.	O
I think we'll be OK.	CHITCHAT
That kind of talk back a bit more.	CHITCHAT
Maybe this is OK.	CHITCHAT
They were only half an hour in I'm surprised I've made a lot of progress in just that half hour.	CHITCHAT
I'm only going to be on until will probably for another hour more so.	CHITCHAT
I can probably finish this up by then you know that's totally in the rumble possibility.	CHITCHAT
That's a bit too green.	O
That's better.	O
There is a lot of work to be done still though.	CHITCHAT
Let's not get too carried away.	CHITCHAT
Looking alright not too bad.	CHITCHAT
I I kind of like this jazz playlist.	CHITCHAT
It's not 1 that normally listen to you, but I'm kind of kind of digging it kind of feeling it.	CHITCHAT
That sounds like a Mario game, though doesn't it.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping this isn't just look like link that would be kind of annoying.	CHITCHAT

Tell me what colors do you use and how to make him look good?	CHITCHAT
Not sorry I like the challenge.	CHITCHAT
That's looking OK this face is really wonky, though how can I make this face less weird?	CHITCHAT
Is it just the eyes are they too scary?	O
I'll just make those darker.	O
That's my answer just make the eyes darker will block him out.	O
He's meant to be.	CHITCHAT
Ambiguous and ambiguous character.	CHITCHAT
He's meant to be a vessel for the player to fill.	CHITCHAT
I guess.	CHITCHAT
This music is kind of getting it isn't it.	CHITCHAT
I like all these little different.	O
Colours, though I like the bits of green and yellow in there, I like.	O
Some of those red tones.	O
Let's try to get some Blues in as well?	O
How's that sound not Blues like the music Blues like the colors?	CHITCHAT
Think of it darker, although it does kind of clash a little bit with the atmosphere.	O
So let's make that more perfectly.	CHITCHAT
But I do want to get a couple of like.	O
Rich Blotchy Purples in there.	O
Like that, maybe a little bit of Green.	O
Little bit of bounce screen you can just put it anywhere, though I tend to feel like you could just do that.	O
Like you could just put him wherever you want, but you really can't.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Will just wait but I do want to get the bow now and I think I don't know should we like give him a cool bow or just give him like a regular bow.	CHITCHAT
Will give him just like a regular bowl it's OK?	O
I might have to fight these fingers a little bit.	O
Now the idea is he's already shot the bow so we should probably have the bowstring a little bit more.	O
Like this.	O
OK.	O
And let's start, bringing these fingers back in.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
I'm liking that.	CHITCHAT
Depth there in a little bit of depth of them fingers.	O
But of course I want there to be some fairly heavy shadows there to show the Bose Shadow.	O
I think his arms a bit too big let's try to push this back a little bit.	O
Just like there may be.	CHITCHAT
Lots of Archers would often have the wrist guard as well.	O
So let's get some risk art action in there.	CHITCHAT
Yes, feel about that just like here.	O
Show like that pad coming up.	O
Like this.	CHITCHAT
I used to be an archery when I was uh Oh young boy.	CHITCHAT
And I had one of these.	CHITCHAT
Forearm guards.	CHITCHAT
'Cause that bowstring man if it goes across your forearm.	CHITCHAT
It's like slice and butter it feels like.	CHITCHAT
It's very painful.	CHITCHAT
We gotta get some highlights in here now.	O
I want to go for something kind of warm.	O
I still wanted to look like he's in the foreground, though, and not falling into the background, too much so I think what I can do for that.	O
To give it a little bit more of a harder edge like this.	O
Things like that.	CHITCHAT

It's working out OK.	CHITCHAT
And uh.	CHITCHAT
Want some he's on this layer here and make a new layer above this guy.	O
And just kind of push in.	O
This here.	O
To really push him back a little bit.	O
Typically, I've been drawing the foreground.	O
Which would usually be the character separately from the background but these 2 are really kind of?	O
Dancing with one another which it's kind of a necessity because of this composition, but it's an interesting thing to take note of I think.	O
All right and of course, we want to give this guys go a little bit more.	O
Magic to it right.	O
I want to make sure that the boat itself.	O
Looks like it's casting off the spell or at least the guy here that we have.	O
Is the one responsible for the spell?	O
So we'll give him like a little bit of highlight?	O
Just like this to really drive home the idea that he's the one responsible for what's happening here.	O
That probably seems pretty obvious, but it's good to make sure.	CHITCHAT
I really love.	CHITCHAT
These cool rich magical colors.	CHITCHAT
OK, what's left let's get some post processing, so it's going to include.	O
A really big softap brush first of all.	O
So let's just grab like this big softap round that'll do.	O
Will make it about maybe 500?	O
OK.	O
And this is all on a new layer on Top and what I want to do is start.	O
Making it a bit softer.	O
That's fine.	CHITCHAT
Well, just push that a little bit there and a little bit here, too.	O
Like that, we're going to change the blend mode.	O
Something like Overlay.	O
Oh really is a bit much, so I think what I'll do.	CHITCHAT
Is?	CHITCHAT
Grab that same.	O
Rush but as an eraser instead.	O
Just kind of push that back a little bit.	O
Looking nice.	O
I'll just grab a couple of different values dot in there.	O
And I also want to get some some red tones as well to kind of push back here a little bit.	O
And that's a bit too, heavy so.	O
This brush is actually being kind of annoying let's drop the flow down, yeah that's better.	O
Toggle that on and off you see, those make it a little bit more rich.	O
Makes a little bit more interesting visually too.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
Now these greens or something I'm very interested in.	O
What do you guys think are we quite done yet?	CHITCHAT
I'm not certain myself.	CHITCHAT
Let's go above the background and start to.	O
Get some of these tones sorted out too.	O

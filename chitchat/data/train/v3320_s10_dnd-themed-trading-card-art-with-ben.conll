Most of this too.	O
Will be a good blend mode for this?	O
I like colored Dodge.	O
Let's see if I can make the color Dodge, a little less aggressive.	O
Now we can always try.	O
Lights off like that.	O
Yeah, there, we go that's getting some vibrance now isn't it.	O
Purple purple tones.	O
If I do.	CHITCHAT
All right and I think I want to add a very slight blur.	O
To actually let's go ahead and now all the blur 1st.	O
We'll just get a very slight Gaussian blur.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Right I actually think what I'll do is go to blur Gallery and set this to tilt shift.	O
Because I don't really want to apply the blurry uniformly so let me grab this tilt shift here.	O
And maybe I should save 1st.	O
Don't apply before saving.	O
'Cause I want this to crash.	O
And then I'll lose everything I just did today, so get that out of the way.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to tilt shift now.	O
And this move that like down here.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
This isn't going to work perfectly because.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it'll be alright.	CHITCHAT
Where is the rotate there it is?	O
So clamp this down a little bit more.	O
Hold a blur in a little bit, too, and the goal of this really is just to give a little bit more focused to the foreground.	O
Go ahead and hit OK on this.	O
And you can see this done a pretty good job, I think of.	CHITCHAT
Bring the foreground in I do want to make sure that all of the pieces of this character, which I think are just the 2 here.	O
Our group those up and now if we hide it, he'll go with it.	O
And we want to blur him a little bit as well.	O
I'll duplicate this and then flatten it.	O
That way I can apply the blurred to both pieces at the same time.	O
Is that too much blur?	CHITCHAT
It makes that highlight look a bit weird, but, yeah, let's put too much blurs in there.	O
I'll drop the blur down quite a bit will make it like 1.4 instead.	O
It's not a number based in science just one off of feeling.	O
But man I gotta see I really like the way the texture is looking.	CHITCHAT
At a distance, it doesn't really stand out, too much.	CHITCHAT
But it really does give that feeling that you want.	CHITCHAT
Next, what I'm going to do is group all of these and then duplicate that group.	O
And then I'm going to flatten it.	O
So now we have a flat version and and not flat version.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to put on Top of that some line art.	O
Up to this point, I've been using a?	O
Pretty basic brush.	O
On purpose, let me bring up some of the previous.	O
I'll save that.	O
Let's take a look.	CHITCHAT
The Ring of invisibility, I guess is a good example.	CHITCHAT
I've been using a very simple brush with a.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
It really is all crusty that was no line weight.	O
Just one single thickness all throughout with a little bit of smoothing turned on for entirely aesthetic reasons.	O
I don't know if that's going to work here, but I'll try it out regardless.	CHITCHAT
Let's give it ago.	O
So that is basically just the hard round brush set to about.	O
I think in this case somewhere around 10 might be good even though that looks a bit big.	O
Still, I'll set it to like 5 are going to get a completely black brush here, so the flow 200 and then in the brush settings, which are here.	O

They definitely have different opinions than me, but that's fine.	CHITCHAT
Let me get some filzen crosshatches as well because that is also a.	O
Pretty big component to this.	O
Visual choice aesthetic.	O
OK, we've just crossed the hour, mark, which means I'm going to be on for about another half hour.	CHITCHAT
And I think what I might do, if I'm not done with this piece by then is will take a look at the discover page, but also will start to think about the composition for the next piece.	CHITCHAT
Turn smoothing all the way off that way I can get these fills really easily.	O
And actually let's go ahead and grab the one tool that will help a little bit as well.	O
Just fill these.	O
Huge huge swathes of area.	O
Go.	O
I feel like colored line art would be a good idea.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if I want to do that or not.	CHITCHAT
Alright, What do you guys think?	CHITCHAT
Did I ruin it with the line art or not?	CHITCHAT
Let's toggle it to find out.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I really feel like it brings some of the contrast and that wasn't there before.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like it, you know.	CHITCHAT
Um something I haven't done up to this point is I've not used color.	O
Look up tables.	O
But I've been thinking about it.	CHITCHAT
I'll see if any of these just look good on their own.	CHITCHAT
Our color look up table is mostly just a combination of adjustment layers.	O
Hue saturation.	O
Curves.	O
Color balance.	O
That kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Well, these are basically just like condensed forms of that.	O
Um there's one I like to use.	O
It's this Blade Runner let.	O
Let's see how that looks.	O
All it does is really.	O
Dark and some of the shadows and makes a lot of the greens into teals.	O
But I think it kind of detracts from the look so let's go and just delete that.	O
And yeah, I think.	CHITCHAT
I think that one's done kind of like the lines.	O
Yeah, I don't know I I think.	CHITCHAT
I think that there OK, either way, I don't think that it's any worse without him.	O
But I wouldn't say it any better with them.	O
I do really like the way that it.	O
Brings this character together in the background, though, but like I said before.	O
He's not really the focus is.	O
He.	CHITCHAT
I think it works, I think it works out OK.	O
OK, with That being said, then let me go ahead and just save that one more time to be certain.	O
Going to delete everything don't be alarmed.	O
Unlock that delete all of this, too, and we're going to save this as.	O
I want to do another creature.	O
I've only got 2, so far.	O
Let me look through the list of.	CHITCHAT
Cannot download the video are we still life.	CHITCHAT
I think we are right.	CHITCHAT
There we go perfect.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to take a look at.	CHITCHAT
Read it.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
The Bodak.	CHITCHAT
I like to look at read it to see what other people's opinions are stuff that they like.	CHITCHAT
Here we go this reminds me a little bit of the undead from.	CHITCHAT

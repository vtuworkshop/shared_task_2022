Zelda actually the re dead rather so the bodak is an undead creature in the DND fantasy RPG that comes from the infinite layers of the abyss.	CHITCHAT
And so humid, humid in shape, smooth grayish black skin with a featureless face its gaze kills living creatures.	CHITCHAT
What I really like is?	CHITCHAT
Getting.	CHITCHAT
Only a description because that let's maybe completely at Square, one with the design.	CHITCHAT
I'm not terribly creative Unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
As far as coming with cool character designs.	CHITCHAT
So I might have a hard time with that, but let's take a look at some other things here.	CHITCHAT
What else have we got?	CHITCHAT
The gelatinous cube is a good one.	CHITCHAT
I like a cube.	CHITCHAT
Oh.	CHITCHAT
Rock rock chasa.	CHITCHAT
What is this Oh it's like a demon?	CHITCHAT
Let's not go with that.	CHITCHAT
I want to find something that I haven't really thought about before.	CHITCHAT
We've already done the holders and very slightly mind slit mind flayers.	CHITCHAT
OK let's do like a hobgoblin.	CHITCHAT
We're going to do that.	CHITCHAT
We're going to do a hobgoblin.	CHITCHAT
I'm kind of feeling that I know I just said a second ago that.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to try to keep it.	CHITCHAT
Keep it unusual.	CHITCHAT
So I wouldn't have any any preconceptions, but I'm kind of feeling this one.	CHITCHAT
Where is my sketch pen and I think will go down to like one of these guys?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, perfect.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go with the Hobgoblin for this.	CHITCHAT
I think we're going to focus mostly I think what we can do is we can get a good composition for the next 15 minutes or so and then once that happens will be able to take a look at this cover page and see if there's anything that catches my eye over there.	CHITCHAT
So this will be kind of quick so.	CHITCHAT
What will be a good concept for the Hobgoblin maybe like I like I like context for these pieces and I like the idea of maybe?	CHITCHAT
The general theme of these cards that you're encountering these things as you go so it's not like you're finding snapshots of just a random creature in a random place, but really it's the way that the player would encounter creatures so.	CHITCHAT
The Ring of invisibility for example, would show the character in the process of equipping the ring.	CHITCHAT
For whatever use that they have showing the results that follow maybe a little bit hard to tell exactly what the point.	CHITCHAT
Here is but nonetheless.	CHITCHAT
It's like a scenario that's happening so I'm imagining.	CHITCHAT
When you get your card and your about to play it.	CHITCHAT
You look at it and you think this is what's happening right now and I'm envisioning maybe you, you stumble into a cave and you come across maybe like a family of hobgoblins or something or maybe just the one I'm not really certain exactly.	CHITCHAT
But something along those lines or maybe you're ambushed by a hobgoblin like on the trail.	CHITCHAT
And the Hobgoblin is like he's like the big boy right, he's like the Alpha gob and in some cases like.	CHITCHAT
Already be like a like Lieutenant.	CHITCHAT
If you're going by military tears.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
So he would typically have like lackeys in total right.	CHITCHAT
The only time you'd really probably square off against the Hobgoblin on its own is after you've defeated his lackeys right so maybe.	CHITCHAT
Maybe he would be standing amid his fallen.	CHITCHAT
His fallen lackeys perhaps.	CHITCHAT
And he's like uh, he's getting ready you know, he's kind of prepared.	CHITCHAT
So it's not an immediate a counter but maybe more so that you've already.	CHITCHAT
Encountered as his followers, So what we can have here maybe then is.	CHITCHAT
Just something for a little bit of context think about it, I'm thinking almost like.	CHITCHAT
He's a big guy right.	CHITCHAT
So he's almost like.	CHITCHAT
Looking down.	CHITCHAT
Like this.	CHITCHAT
I'm not too sure if this is going to work good, though.	CHITCHAT

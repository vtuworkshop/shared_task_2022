It is uh as my screens right here.	CHITCHAT
This is the the surface screen.	CHITCHAT
I need to see it react so that we can get to there goes and then the bottom you can see my open apps.	CHITCHAT
But I have a fresco Photoshop and illustrator.	CHITCHAT
Let me see.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can kind of see them down there.	CHITCHAT
That's cool alright.	CHITCHAT
So this opened up fresco.	CHITCHAT
And so I did a drawing earlier today and I was like Oh man that came out kinda cool if I had just.	O
No, that I could do that I would have done a better job so I'm gonna do a better job of doing this illustration featuring myself.	O
So let's go ahead and get a square document just click on it boom.	O
You're in Adobe fresco.	O
An let me get my vector brush.	O
That's all I need nothing else.	O
Now let's take a look at our set up here.	O
And see if that works yes, OK cool cool cool cool.	CHITCHAT
And uh.	CHITCHAT
Yes, until real quick perfect cool, so I got the.	CHITCHAT
Vector brush I'm using the basic round.	O
My color I guess I could try a color.	O
And then uh the sizes 10.	O
That's good my brush settings their basic.	O
I've not touched him just leave it the way they are, and now I'm gonna go ahead and draw and so whenever I draw and uhm no matter what it is whatever my drawing process always starts with shapes.	O
Throwing a shape up because I'm drawing myself and I have appeared in my beard is gone through different sizes and stages.	O
I just go ahead and draw big beard and then boom just do it like that right.	O
Bam and let's go ahead like this, and start making some curls on the beard you know just for fun.	O
Bomb but because I know what I'm after in what I'm gonna be doing.	CHITCHAT
I am kinda looking for a particular.	O
Uh set lines and so let's do the ears real quick when Bono get caught up in you know the beard.	O
And still ahead and do something like this, dude, I.	CHITCHAT
Want the arm.	O
The eyebrows.	O
The eye when I was gonna go like this spam.	O
Yes, yes, yes yes.	CHITCHAT
And so the idea for this uh abstract illustration came from a drawing that I did earlier and that's actually.	CHITCHAT
I think I drew it here on be hands.	CHITCHAT
However, I did take it down because there was some kind of lag with the.	CHITCHAT
With the video.	CHITCHAT
So there this is room for the nose is super nose.	O
Yes, and just start making lines and basically what you're doing now, what I discovered I've just playing around uh that is uhm.	O
No.	CHITCHAT
That I that I can do some effects that look make it look really cool and uh.	O
It just has to have a lot of lines that crossover.	O
So any case here we go.	CHITCHAT
Damn, there, we go right, and so let's do it.	CHITCHAT
A cheekbone and that that she bought it just has to have a lot of minds.	O
And so some Michaels on this side.	O
Michaels Oh yeah, this is cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm just gonna be alright so let's just.	CHITCHAT
I am making.	O
A lot of crossing.	O
Lines but I don't want to make.	O
Small tiny little gaps let's go right here.	O
There goes the sum of the mustache.	O
Hey girl, It is.	CHITCHAT
Pretty cool huh?	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
So it is OK.	O
All right.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright that's it, it's looking good.	O
And so kind of added extra detail that it did not have in my first drawing but that's OK.	O

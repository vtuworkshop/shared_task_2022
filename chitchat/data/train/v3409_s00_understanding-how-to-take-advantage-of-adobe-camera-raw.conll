Let me just make sure I got one more window up and will start with today's content so we're going to be doing.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be doing some Camera roll today, something that I actually talk about quite a bit.	O
But I don't talk about it in terms of Camera raw necessarily in photo shop and even Adobe Bridge.	O
So we'll be taking a look at how that all works today.	O
So thanks for being here and let's go ahead and dive in I cannot seem to find this one.	CHITCHAT
So we'll just have to go without it.	CHITCHAT
All right what I was looking for here.	CHITCHAT

Is that 57 sipek or so I guess I am at welcome everybody?	CHITCHAT
Let's go ahead and click on the Facebook folks as well.	CHITCHAT
So we can get their comments up.	CHITCHAT
And today were going again take a look at Adobe Camera raw so for those of you who are new and saying well.	O
Kamarov heard that sounds like a thing for photographers.	CHITCHAT
You would be right.	CHITCHAT
If you were thinking about 5 years ago, 6 years ago Camera raw was absolutely developed actually make more like 7 years ago Camera is absolutely developed for photographers to take advantage of the raw files coming off the cameras that is no longer.	O
The only reason to use Camera that hasn't been the only reason to use Camera roll actually for years.	CHITCHAT
Because anyone can use Camera raw even if you don't have a Camera even if you never shot an image even if you don't have a Camera that shoots raw even if you just use your Phone Camera.	O
You can take advantage of Camera even if you don't do any photography just open up images.	O
So then you might be asking well, what's the advantage of working with Camera like?	CHITCHAT
What do I get if I work in Camera as opposed to the way I always work say in photo shop?	CHITCHAT
Or other image editors well the advantage of Camera raw has been, and still is that it's non destructive In other words, you can make adjustments to your image that are visibly there, but really the adjustments themselves are stored as metadata, so that way.	O
If you ever want to make a change or delete the edits you made.	O
You can so it's never really permanently writing.	O
Those changes to the file so rather than just talk about it.	CHITCHAT
Why don't I go ahead and give you a quick tour?	CHITCHAT
Alright so I've got photo shop open right now.	O
An on my desktop I've got a folder here with this particular image is an actual Camera.	O
Raw image as you can see from the extension.	O
It's dot NF that is a Nikon or necon brand.	O
It raw file if you shot it with a Canon it might say CR2 if you shot it with a Sony.	O
It may say something is probably gonna say something else, so the different Camera manufacturers will use.	O
Their own extension for their own raw files so pay no attention to that because it's going to vary Camera by Camera.	O

You'll notice that a bunch of these also RDNG that stands for digital negative that is also a as a raw file that is non proprietary that's actually Adobe's longstanding proposed standard for raw files that aren't Camera manufacturer specific aren't software specific so if you have a DNG file can be created by any Camera who converted from any cameras native raw format into DNG.	O
And used in software all the way back to photo shop 7.	O
I don't mean there's no CS 7.	CHITCHAT
But all the way back to version 7 before there was even a CS let alone a CC so that's the advantage of DNG is that it's backwards compatible all the way back to the beginning and by the way it was around photo shop 7 when raw first became a thing or editing on your computer all right.	O
So now that we know what the files come from and we know that they'll have variant extensions.	O
And we know that there is technically no real standard because all the Camera.	O
Manufacturers write their own raw files and Eng could be a standard or propose dinner, but it's not globally in use by all manufacturers.	O
Then, what's the advantage of doing this again well again.	CHITCHAT
If I double click on a raw file.	O
And right now, it's going to open up in something else hang on.	O
I want to open up in that extensionality set this to open in photo shop.	O
Sorry folks it was opening up in a plugin and not photo shop.	CHITCHAT
And let's do that OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's try one more time with double click, and now should open up in Photoshop and it should actually instead of just opening.	O
It shows me Camera.	O
Raw first because Photoshop said.	O
Oh wait you double clicked on a raw file.	O
Therefore, you might you probably want to open this up in Camera raw first so that you can do anything you want.	O
Nondestructively before you go into photo shop, so you can adjust the image to your heart's content so you notice that this seems very dark.	O
It was taken at the Lake at night.	O
I see, there's a streak going by that was probably a car lights.	O
It was a long exposure and isoft silky water.	O
But the image still could stand some improvement.	O
First of all.	CHITCHAT
It's just too dark to begin with Secondly, we can bring some of those details out that the Camera captured.	O
From its sensor into that raw format and by the way if you just wondering what is raw mean in general it means that the Camera did not process the image in anyway.	O
This is right from the Camera sensor to the memory card into your computer with a JPEG when you take a picture or use your Phone or whatever and you capture jpegs that the device that you captured it with is making all kinds of decisions for you, it may have brightened it for you, it may have corrected the color for you.	O
It may have done all kinds of things for you and more importantly, it compressed.	O
The image and those things are baked into the file so they're not as easily changed so that's the advantage of working with raw versus JPEG.	O
But we really here to talk about Camera.	CHITCHAT
So now that I'm here in the Camera roll dialog box, which by the way.	O
I want you guys to know that this is a window that opens up and you can by all means expand.	O
That window out.	O
You do not have to live with that little sliver of a Camera window you can make it the full size your.	O
Display once you get Camera open you'll notice that it's really he's pretty easy.	O
Interface don't be.	O
You know alarm by all the buttons at the Top and all the stuff over here on the side.	O
What Camera is for the most part or sliders in the slider start in the middle and you go left or right to make decisions so if you wanted to make an image brighter.	O
You can drag the exposure and make the image brighter.	O
Until you go to bright it looks like we just turned on the sun in this moment.	O
But all that detail was there in the raw file even though this was taken in the middle of the night or we can go completely dark to where we basically barely see the moon, there, so there is no right or wrong.	O
It's whatever looks best for you so if I say, Oh, that's brighter, but I wanted a little brighter.	O
I want a little brighter.	CHITCHAT
I wanted a little brighter.	CHITCHAT
I can just keep going.	CHITCHAT
Until I like it and if I ever come back and change my mind.	O
That sliders there in a position I last left it in and I can come back and change it.	O
That's the advantage of doing this in Camera if you would do the same thing in photo shop and you work, you didn't prepare first like for example, make a smart object or do something that make an extra layer or duplicate the file if you didn't make if you didn't make a conscious decision to protect yourself first, then whatever you would do would be permanent soon as you save the file that changes permanent to that file.	O

So a lot of the workflows that people have used over the years, such as duplicating layer first saving an extra copy of the image.	O
Converting the Smart Smart objects all of that was designed.	O
So that you could always go back and change your mind.	O
Camera raw starts out that way from the very beginning.	O
There is nothing else, I have to do whenever I'm making whatever changes.	O
I'm making here I can go back and change my mind.	O
So let's say that I made it brighter like that, and I click done well.	O
Nothing happens, because I open the image in Camera raw.	O
I made a change and I click done.	O
I didn't click open to continue working out in photo shop.	O
So now if I go back to the desktop where that images will notice something we get an extra file.	O
We get the original raw file untouched.	O
Unaltered nothing hard node pixels were harmed in the making of this video.	O
And then we get this new file.	O
This ex MP.	O
This metadata file.	O
This is what contains that exposure adjustment if I throw this away.	O
And double click on that file again and open it back in photo shop.	O
Let's just do it.	CHITCHAT
Throw away that be edit basically.	O
And double click on the file again.	O
Yes, I'm sure.	CHITCHAT
An open it back up.	O
Just as dark as it always was because the end, it isn't in the file it's in the meta data.	O
Now sometimes depending on a file format.	O
The metadata can be stored inside the file like a DNG or JPEG.	O
There is no separate site.	O
We call those sidecar files.	O
There's no separate file but it's still just as non destructive.	O
You don't get a convenient file to just throw away but you could reset the image back to its original without getting rid of all of the things that you've done to it, so for example, if I were to adjust these sliders make it brighter increase the shadows.	O
Uh maybe make it more vibrant so we get a blue or Sky, so forth and so on, and I hold down my option key or alt key you notice that there is a reset or maybe you don't because the Windows 2, too long.	O
So we're going to pull that window up so you can see it.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
You notice that there is a reset when I hold down option instead of cancel so I hit reset that resets everything back to the way it was so whether you have a separate sidecar file that you can toss if you ever need to, or the metadata is being stored inside the file Dingees JPEG, so forth and so on, you still are working in a non destructive.	O
Workflow alright so for example, what if I don't know what sliders to drop to try.	O
I know exposure that makes it brighter or darker.	O
But what if I don't know about the rest well in Camera raw.	O
There's a very cool Adobe.	CHITCHAT
Sensei powered auto and if you click auto that looks at the image and tries to guess what?	O
It should be.	O
You're not going to always agree with the guess that's OK, but you have the ability to start use that as a starting point to adjust a bunch of sliders for you and then you can go tweak what you don't like so for example, if I click auto.	O
Did a pretty good job?	CHITCHAT
I wish I could be happy with that, but maybe?	CHITCHAT
I want more so for example, maybe I still want it to be even a little brighter.	O
Maybe I want some more brightness, but only in a certain spot.	O
Maybe I only want the foreground to be brighter.	O
Maybe I'm going to put some text down there and I kind of wanted to stand out so these sliders are all global adjustments, but you have an adjustment brush.	O
A graduated filter and a radial filter to make adjustments to individual parts of an image so for example, if I click on the adjustment brush.	O
You'll notice that it zeroed out everything and it put the exposure up by like one stop.	O
Let's pull the exposure back down a little bit.	O
And let's grab my my brush now.	O
I'm going to take my stylus here.	O
I'm just going to brush down here and I notice everywhere, I brush.	O
It gets brighter, so if I brush down here and brush in this area.	O
Everything gets brighter in that area, but it only got brighter by.	O
Almost half a stop .45.	O
Well, now that I made the Brush Adjustment.	O
I can crank up anything I can make it brighter.	O

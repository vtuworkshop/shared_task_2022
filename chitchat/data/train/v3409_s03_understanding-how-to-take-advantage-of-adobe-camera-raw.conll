Still, I can make that ground like a spot lights on it.	O
I can also say, Oh, I didn't mean to go into water.	O
Let me hold down my option key.	O
Or alt key and he raced that part over there, so the brush toggles plus or minus depending on whether or not you holding on your optional all key now that adjustment is being made, not just to exposure, but anything else, I do so for example, if I were to turn down saturation.	O
Then it would make it more of a black-and-white just in that one spot.	O
If I were to crank up saturation.	O
It becomes just more saturated just in that one spot, so even though I started with exposure.	O
Brush adjustment.	O
I can go in and make any slider adjustment after the fact so if I wanted the shadow still to be brighter.	O
In that area.	O
The shadows could still be brighter in that area, or darker net area.	O
If I want the dehaze that spot a little bit.	O
I can be haze that spot a little bit.	O
I'm going to just any slider after the fact so let's say that I also kind of want those trees.	O
Often, in the background there to be brighter as well.	O
Well, I've already made this adjustment and if I start.	O
Brushing the trees the trees are just going to get exactly what I've done to the foreground here.	O
So what I can do is you notice that In addition to.	O
Add.	O
There is new, so when I click new that, saying I want a new point to brush whip, so now I'm brushing up here.	O
In the trees with a brand new set of adjustments.	O
I'm just gonna quickly brush over here.	O
And so now the sliders that I'm working with apply to just those trees.	O
So if I were to say for example.	O
Maybe not exposure so much.	O
But maybe I want the shadows to be a lot higher.	O
I can bring out those trees.	O
Just with the shadows slider to a point because it is dark over there, so you might start getting some artifacts or noise because you're trying to bring something out that really the Camera didn't capture or doesn't exist.	O
All right, but anyway, um those adjustments are happening just to that spot if I want to go back to adjusting this one notice.	O
When I hover over.	O
It shows me what I painted I can click on it, and now I'm making adjustments back in the foreground.	O
So I'm making the foreground brighter or darker or going to the trees and making the trees brighter or darker again based on which point or which pin I click on and I can have as many of those adjustments as I want so if I were to add 1 more.	O
One more new one and I were to come down here in the water and I'm brushing the water.	O
Just sounds weird to say that I'm brushing the water, but yes, I am.	O
Come over here and brush some more water.	O
An I would take my time and zoom in and make sure I get all the water.	O
But just quickly.	O
I brushed the water over there.	O
Now, who do whatever I want to the water, the water is a bit too.	O
Too much was pulled down some of the shadows there, but I could also send the saturation is way up on the water.	O
That's why I got so blue, but I could say you know what?	O
Maybe I want the water to be green.	O
I can adjust the tent make just that pinpoint green or pink or whatever, so I'm going to just that or the temperature I can make it blue or?	O
I can make it unrealistically blue like someone poured blue ink into it, but I can do whatever I want any part of the image.	O
All non destructively because of Camera and again if I were to click done it would simply close the close the Camera image and go back to the desktop or if I click open it will open a copy.	O
Into photo shop with those adjustments done to it.	O
Alright, it looks creepy with the foreground lighter, then Colleen don't like your foreground or go back and turn it down alright anyway.	O
The it's now in photo shop and again.	O
Now, if I'm making changes here.	O
I am being destructive to this copy.	O
But the original is still intact if I were to go back and say, Oh, I really screwed this one up close, it and open up the original again with those edits like calling doesn't like the foreground that bright so we were to go back and say no now let's go back to that raw file and open it up again.	O
And then we were to click on the adjustment brush.	O
And then we're going to that pin point because the client in this case, Colleen from South Africa wants to dial down the brightness and I agree.	O
It was too bright, but I made a point.	O
Now I can go and start from that, starting point, so again Camera raw non destructive go back make any changes you want.	O

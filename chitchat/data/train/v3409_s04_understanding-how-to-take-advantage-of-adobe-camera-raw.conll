Whenever you want.	O
And if you do open in photo shop, you're opening a copy of the raw file.	O
Now the next thing is what if you don't.	CHITCHAT
So not is asking and that's where I'm headed with it.	CHITCHAT
Not in, not is asking do I get all those options on a JPEG and this is?	O
what I was about to say?	O
What if I don't have raw files.	O
I'm not let's say.	CHITCHAT
I am photography, but let's say here not a photographer.	CHITCHAT
You don't shoot raw.	O
You don't have a Camera that produces raw files.	O
You don't have clients to give you raw files.	O
You're just work with Jpegs or tips or anything else.	O
Well again back when this first came out.	O
It only worked with raw files.	O
But since that time allowed us changed not only can it work with Jpegs or tips or anything else but there was a secret, so let's go ahead and close this one.	O
And let's say that I wanted to do this with a JPEG so I have some jpegs here.	O
And again if you know what happens if I double click on his JPEG if I double click this JPEG, it opens it up.	O
Where's my Camera raw benefit?	CHITCHAT
I don't get it in this case at least not unless I know how to do it.	CHITCHAT
I don't get it by default because Photoshop just opens up Jpegs.	O
But if I were to close that JPEG and there's a couple of ways.	O
I can get I can do this, I can go up to the file menu.	O
I'm going to choose open.	O
An I can go into where that is, it's annoying as in here.	O
It's in here it's in here and it's in here and those are the Jpegs.	O
But if I were to go and click on one.	O
Let's say that one instead of opening up like I normally would as a JPEG.	O
You would normally never even touch this stuff if I were to go here and say no no open it up in Camera raw instead.	O
Then that JPEG this one time opens up in Camera raw and I get to do everything that I just showed you to it.	O
So that's one way to do it and again not even that's old-fashioned 'cause.	O
I don't have to do that anymore.	O
But that would be a one off.	O
Hey, I just want to open up.	O
This JPEG in Camera raw and do these things to it in Camera raw like I would do with a raw file.	O
But you don't have to do this anymore.	O
Let me show you one more thing in case you do like that workflow.	O
Let's say you just always want to start with Camera because it's so easy well.	O
You can set that as your preference.	O
You can go into your preferences into Camera raw preferences area you probably have never gone into.	O
And you can say Hey for file handling.	O
Every time I click on any supported file all Jpegs just automatically open him up in Camera.	O
So what that would mean if I go back here and I now double click on a JPEG.	O
Let's double click on the 2nd one boom.	O
It opens up in Camera.	O
Raw just like a raw file would so if you like that, and you want that to be your default change.	O
It one time and then every time you double click on a file.	O
It opens up in Camera and if you don't want to do anything no problem.	O
Just click open.	O
And you're in photo shop in the way you normally would be so that is.	O
Took one way to be your default for always working in Camera, but that's right Jonas boom.	CHITCHAT
I like that, and Happy New Year so again.	CHITCHAT
It gets better because we don't even have to do that anymore.	O
So I'm going to set my Camera up reference back to the way it normally is.	O
'Cause I don't I used to have it set that way.	O
But I don't need to anymore.	O
Let's go back and said it.	O
This one let's go back and set it to just with settings click OK.	O
Well, you're saying, you don't have to do that anymore.	CHITCHAT
Why?	CHITCHAT
Because if I open up any file.	O
Like this one, it's in photo shop did not get to Camera 1st.	O
Camera.	O
Is a filter?	CHITCHAT
It has been now for a few versions of Photoshop.	O
And so that means any layer.	O
You can apply Camera roll to any image can be Camera.	O
Raw can be applied to it has nothing to do with raw files anymore.	O
You get that same beautiful easy non, destructive Workflow Workflow, now the differences.	O
If you use the filter like any filter if you don't prepare the image first it will be destructive.	O
Even Camross filter will be destructive if you don't do one thing 1st.	O
If you don't go in first and say convert for smart filters.	O
If you skip this step.	O
You can you can use Camera it just will be making permanent changes that you can't go back and undo?	O
But if I say convert per smart filters, 1st and convert that into a smart object layer now when I go back to filter and I go to Camera raw filter, which there it is.	O
It's been there.	CHITCHAT
Now, for awhile.	CHITCHAT

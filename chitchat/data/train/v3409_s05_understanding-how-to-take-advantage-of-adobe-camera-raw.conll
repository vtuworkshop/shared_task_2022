I can run Camera on anything I can open in Photoshop.	O
Any layer any image and here it is so I get the same sliders.	O
This same adjustment brush this like for example, so if I go to the adjustment brush and I just want to make the grass a little greener, I can change the tent to green.	O
And I can go in and start that's too light, but anyway, I can start making the grass.	O
Green it's OK.	O
Those 2 light.	O
Let's me see why.	CHITCHAT
I'm painting and then of course I can go in and say no no no.	O
Because the exposure also went up no no that's too much.	O
Now let's drop the exposure by the way can reset any slider to 0 by double clicking.	O
Let's drop the exposure back down.	O
Let's drop the shadows back down and now we're just dealing with the color so I can tune the color of that grass anything that I want either temperature or tent or even just working with there's a color option now the very bottom.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
All in if I click OK now.	O
You'll notice that there is a Camera raw element added to that.	O
Smart filter that I can always double click on to get back to or simply turn off if I don't like those adjustments or want to turn it off temporarily so if I say no.	O
I do like them.	CHITCHAT
But maybe that needs to be deleted or turned down or something else needs to be done double click.	O
I'm right back in the Camera raw and if I go to my adjustment brush.	O
I have that pen that I can say.	O
I can click on it, and I can delete it.	O
And get right back to where I was that adjustment is now gone click OK again.	O
An I'm I haven't really done anything but the Camera is still there, if I want to go back and make more changes so.	O
Camera filter for anything that you can open in Photoshop and it can be layer by layer so if you were to add a new layer just for the sake of example.	O
Art of Dragon, new layer in.	O
Make it small just put it up here.	O
For now, just for the sake of example and now I've got this new layer called blue Sky.	O
And I were to do the same thing I were to come.	O
I don't think this.	CHITCHAT
I think this one is already a smart filter.	O
It is our two now just gotta filter an Camera raw.	O
I'm now working with just that, once I want to darken those clouds down, no problem click, OK and that's been done to just that one layer did not affect the layer below so you could do it on a layer by layer basis.	O
You can make everything look exactly the way you want Dang this impose 4 days late.	CHITCHAT
No, it's actually early.	CHITCHAT
For every image.	CHITCHAT
You're going to do from now on our anyway.	CHITCHAT
Turn that one off turn that one on go back to the other one.	O
The other ones adjustments are still there, I can make whatever changes.	O
I want layer by layer in Camera.	O
All right, so the Camera filters.	O
Amazing I use it all the time so that's why I don't open up.	O
Jpegs in Camera raw anymore because I don't have to have the filter.	O
Amen raw files automatically open up in Camera an marks asking this question that I expected to come up and he's asking is this the same with Lightroom well.	O
Lightroom's develop an editing depending on which version of light room.	O
You're talking about is Camera, so every slider every ability is the same in light room and that's why I do it in light room because that's where my images are as a photographer.	O
But if you're a designer your graphic designer.	O
You don't shoot in raw you don't shoot images at all.	O
Then you would do it here, either in raw Camera or in the Camera filter.	O
That's the whole point of it now one last thing.	O
And that is the Camera raw filter amazing.	O
I use it all the time, but there is something it can't do that Camera raw can do In other words, the filter is just a filter.	O
It will filter whatever layer you want.	O
Just like I showed you but Camera itself has some processing capabilities that the filter does not have so let me close these up.	O
I'm just going to close this and I'm going to save any changes.	O
Uh 2 things that you would process panoramas, an HD R and again.	O
These are more photographers graphic designers would probably won't run into this.	O
But as a as a photographer, I have these 4 images here, I'll show you what they look like.	O
That's 1234 they were shot like this click click click click.	O
You gotta make Panorama well.	O
Now your Phone does it just by holding it anyway.	O
But if you were using a regular Camera and you were shooting a Panorama.	O
You would probably have multiple images 2 or more.	O
So now I could select those 4 images and again.	O
I would do this in light room.	O
But if I weren't in light room.	O

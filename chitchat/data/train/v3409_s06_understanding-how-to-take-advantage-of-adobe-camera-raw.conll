I can still double click on all 4 images offer raw files.	O
Oh no what the heck is this OK.	O
I don't know what that was Skip Skip Skip Oh, it's still opening that stupid perfectly clear hang on.	O
So what happens when you try a plugin so let's do this same thing.	O
I need to teach it that it should open these up in photo shop and not the thing that took over my whole computer.	O
Are there?	CHITCHAT
OK, cool, so now back to what I was saying.	CHITCHAT
If you were to take all four of those images and open him up, they would all open up in Camera raw in photo shop.	O
And there, there on the side here, then a film strip.	O
The filter doesn't give you a film strip.	O
The filter can only handle 1 layer at a time.	O
But in this film strip view.	O
I could select all four of these images.	O
And I could go to the film strip menu in the upper left corner here and I can choose merge to Panorama.	O
And when I choose merge Crown Arama.	O
It's going to do the merge.	O
It's going to give me a preview and I'm going to say no no no.	O
I know you cut some off guard and fill the edges in which is a new feature.	O
So I'm going to get the full Panorama and now I'm going to go ahead and say merge and what that will do is create a brand new raw file so it's creating a file that didn't exist.	O
That's the combination of all four of those images and it opens it up and wrong.	O
So I can continue editing it and continue working with it.	O
So I have the original 4 on the left plus the brand new stitch together Panorama.	O
An now I can do whatever I want with this because this is a brand new image so if I want to.	O
Again, it already did auto on it, but I want to make it even brighter or more vibrant and more saturation make it unrealistically green and blue I can.	O
Because again this is all non destructive and I can do whatever I want here, so again same thing.	O
If I open the image.	O
It will open it up in Photoshop to keep working.	O
Open up a copy of it.	O
If I say done then.	O
It just applies those changes that are still non destructive to the actual image.	O
All right that's yes that is really fun is that Agni Ogni.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully pronouncing it correctly one more thing that you can process.	CHITCHAT
I did a man HD are I'm sorry did Panorama.	CHITCHAT
The other thing is an HD are so what's an HD R versus a Panorama.	O
The difference is it's the same image captured with 2 or more exposures.	O
So this is a medium dark light so that I can bring out all the details that would normally get lossed with a single exposure so for example, we go to the medium exposure.	O
You'll notice that these stain glass windows are all blown out.	O
If we go to the darker exposure.	O
They're still blown out, but we can see yeah, we can see a couple of over here, we go to the light.	O
One everything is blown out, So what this will do is if I select all 3.	O
I can say merge 2 HD R.	O
And it will create a composite of all preimages, bringing over all that dynamic range from the shadows.	O
All the way to the highlights in everything in between to give me a new image so again merge.	O
That will create this new image that I'm telling you to save.	O
And now I've got this new image open that I can do anything.	O
I want with so if I were to bring down.	O
This highlights a little bit more.	O
Yeah, there, there comes a stain glass soda stain glass now is there.	CHITCHAT
Barber bring Dana White's a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
We can see windows and things that we normally wouldn't have seen with that one exposure.	O
We still keep the detail in the light areas.	O
We still keep the detail in the dark areas and This is why photographers create HD.	O
Rs neither one of those would be available in the Camera filter but.	O
Both of those are available in Camera light room and last but not least I said that once already I'm sure.	O
There's this application called Adobe Bridge.	O
Adobe bridges had Camera built into it also for many, many years, so if you wonder?	CHITCHAT
Why would I ever use bridge.	CHITCHAT
If you want to process a bunch of images at the same time, using Camera and you weren't Electra music.	O
If your light room user you don't need this, if you are not a light room user.	O
You're an occasional user.	O
That process is a bunch of images that's where Camera raw and bridge comes in handy so once again.	O
I could select multiple images.	O
Here hit command R control arm windows.	O
Take me into Camera raw and Camera.	O
Raws built right into bridge also what's nice about bridge.	O
Is it can be processing a bunch of images hundreds of images doing things to them while you work in photo shop versus if you work in Cameron photo shop.	O
It ties up photo shop until your done so.	O
That's another reason why we use programs like Lightroom and programs like Bridge to do that work for us.	O

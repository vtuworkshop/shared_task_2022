While we're doing things in Photoshop, so for example, I could process hundreds of HD Rs at the same time.	O
In light room while I work in Photoshop, so that is Camera.	O
That's hopefully you understand a little bit better now than you did, 29 minutes ago.	CHITCHAT

The problem when I strongly light in the dark area colored dots, sometimes appear in this area so.	O
Asking on Facebook.	CHITCHAT
When they strongly lighten a darkened area, so let's say we take this one.	O
And let's say we were to go in with the adjustment brush and we were to go in and we're going to reset that it were reset saturation going to Reset D Hayes.	O
And we were to just do exposure in this really dark area right here.	O
Well, you'll notice that we zoom in on that it didn't really do, do, do us justice because we went to bright and what he said, is about strongly lighting something up so if I bring that down a little bit.	O
Then it becomes OK.	O
If I go too far.	O
I'm going to start getting artifacts and what he's probably referring to with color Docs is called noise.	O
And noise is something that happens in digital photography when the sensor doesn't have enough information to render a proper image, meaning it was too dark, so Unfortunately.	O
There's not a ton, you can do depending on how badly the noise?	CHITCHAT
How bad the noises, however.	CHITCHAT
Just note that kamarov does have noise reduction, so I would try the noise reduction slider in that same area that you're brightening up way too bright.	O
'Cause it was too dark to begin with, and see if that reduces the color noise.	O
Also, there's noise reduction here and there is.	O
There is a definite didn't didn't tomorrow.	O
I'm hang on in the adjustment brush that's why.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Get out of the adjustment brush OK.	O
Forget out the adjustment brush.	O
You have the noise reduction in the adjustment brush, but you also have.	O
A detailed tab and that's the one with the Little Pyramids.	O
Here little triangles.	O
The detail tab has a whole noise reduction section, including color noise reduction.	O
Windows little doctor seeing so it will try and reduce the color noise that was introduced into the image as a result.	O
OK.	O
So hopefully you got something out of all this working in raw.	CHITCHAT
I want you to work in raw now.	O
Camera that is whether you shoot whether you shoot for all the time you should jpegs all the time you don't shoot anything you process images.	O
It is the way to go in terms of.	O
Working with imagery imagery that you want to be non destructive so again cancel out of this it.	O
Will it will do nothing to the image but if I had apply that horrible adjustment to it, I could always go back and delete it.	O
Undo it change.	O
It drag the slider.	O
The other way because it's completely non, destructive all the time.	O
When is it destructive it's only destructive when you render out a copy of the image so the original still stays in to actually print share put online make a JPEG from so forth and so.	O
All right folks with that, said, well thank you for watching uhm.	CHITCHAT

I want to try to do 15 pushups.	CHITCHAT
Every morning I have already failed at it 'cause I missed today.	CHITCHAT

Let me know in the chat with your news New Year's resolutions are and I'm going to start drawing so tonight.	CHITCHAT
I'm using Adobe fresco as usual.	O
It is my favorite drawing app.	O
Currently, that Adobe has there's a few of 'em in the App Store their stuff like Adobe draw.	O
Adobe Photoshop sketch that kind of stuff.	O
They even launched Adobe Photoshop on the iPad.	O
It's kind of a lightweight version.	O
I was kinda, hoping it would be some more features in it, but not the point.	CHITCHAT
Fresco is the new one that I think is is definitely kind of leading the charge for them as far as drawing apps go for Adobe.	O
And there's a hair dust or something on my iPad.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that I like fresco alot, like it's definitely become one of my favorite apps.	CHITCHAT
I'm starting to use it for a lot of client work and it's certainly taken over to at least layout.	O
My characters and then if I want to add texture.	O
Things like that.	CHITCHAT
I take it out of fresco and put it into illustrator usually my workflow.	O

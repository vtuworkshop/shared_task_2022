You know you don't have to.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know if it helps me at all.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like having like the multiple layers.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it Sparks ideas like the way the lines kind of overlap.	CHITCHAT
I start to see something and caveman.	CHITCHAT
Yes, Kim This Is It's a caveman exactly.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, see.	CHITCHAT
Now we're going to start we do this every stream like I start building stories and talking about like what their lives were like so we've got like this, you know, bearded caveman.	CHITCHAT
Person.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't know just kind of grumpy like maybe didn't get like this, you know.	CHITCHAT
Is mutton?	CHITCHAT
Men called me, I don't know what they called me.	CHITCHAT
What is money even now all I know is that money is something we used to eat and when I played Skyrim?	CHITCHAT
Not in real life, like I ate in the game.	CHITCHAT
While I played Skyrim, I think I ate baloney, and cheese.	CHITCHAT
Lot weird part of my life.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Because they talk about the red line sketch so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I started doing it 'cause sometimes.	CHITCHAT
It Sparks ideas.	CHITCHAT
While I'm drawing like where these like little like little folds, and stuff.	CHITCHAT
My illustrations and it started kind of helping me to identify like better wear those folds kind of can occur and it's going to be a little bit of a better road map when drawing so again.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's you know it's not for everybody.	CHITCHAT
But I started doing it, yes, it's pretty much just me retracing stuff.	CHITCHAT
A large majority of the time, but it just gives me a little more confidence when I go to do the thinking part.	CHITCHAT
And we want to do the whole thing, but like just kind of.	O
Some stuff.	O
'Cause, like I'll use it now to like really kind of.	O
Taylor in this beard here.	O
And in case it was curious so I'm using an Apple pencil.	O
I'm on an iPad.	O
The 9.7 inch also just realized man hold on my monitor.	O
It has me all blown out.	CHITCHAT
Can I adjust that let's see here sorry folks.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to turn down this light?	CHITCHAT
That's on my face, making me like insanely.	CHITCHAT
Turn this down a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Better.	CHITCHAT
Have a big monitor in front of me that you can see on the webcam and the light from it is so bright that with the webcam sometimes makes my face like Super Crazy blown out, so I apologize about that.	CHITCHAT
Anyway to do what I'm doing here.	CHITCHAT
I'm using an iPad 610.	CHITCHAT
Nine point 7 inch in an Apple pencil so every so often.	CHITCHAT
You'll notice my lines are like really nice and fine an right now.	O
They're like kind of like thick and the way I'm doing that is by angling the pencil or the yeah.	O
Apple pencil almost said the brush pen that would've been where the Apple pencil sideways and just kind of like see if I could show you this kind of like you know just.	O
Going like that kind of like when you draw with the side of a pencil normally.	O
And again I apologize that I was like super blown out there for a minute.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to get a better webcam.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe a DSL are some sort so that.	CHITCHAT
You all can see my.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
Ugly mug.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't say my beautiful face but?	CHITCHAT
Like a poorly shaving kind of disheveled person so really called that.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we got this, dude's beard.	O
Alright I'll sketched in configure the rest of this out as we kind of go.	O
So one thing that's kind of cool about the beard like when I do her.	O
I was just fill it in with a solid color.	O
Maybe tonight will try and some little different.	O
I don't know we'll see.	CHITCHAT
Let's make a new layer so one cool thing I would like to point out the fresco.	O
Even if I didn't make a cool new layer and I just selected my vector brush.	O
If you look over where my brushes are I have my toolbar set on the.	CHITCHAT
Right side because I'm left handed so I draw with this hand, they use this.	CHITCHAT
Thumb typically to kind of go through an select on the toolbar what I need to use so.	CHITCHAT
If you select the vector brush and let's set this too black for right now and excuse me.	CHITCHAT
If you select the vector brush an you just start drawing fresco recognizes that you're not using a pixel brush and it makes a new layer if you look over on the other side again on the left side.	O

It will recognize and it will make a new vector layer for you so you know something something kind of cool.	O
Let's think about why you working kind of just kind of jump in and do your thing and we start with here.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
Should probably turn on pressure dynamics and I should turn this down so I I am working with a square canvas here.	O
I think it's.	CHITCHAT
Solution settings 4096 by 4096, so it's pretty big.	O
I believe fresco labels as 4K.	O
Is a 4K Square and rightfully so that's really nice.	O
If you're working with pixel brushes a lot and you need a really large canvas 'cause you don't want to have to go back and re draw anything 'cause.	O
If you scale up a pixel.	O
It's not a vector.	O
It doesn't scale infinitely which is a big pain in the butt.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
You know it's a good price size to work with that I do work with vectors a lot, so.	CHITCHAT
Kind of weird that I'm working with canvas that big so I really don't need to.	CHITCHAT
But it's all good.	CHITCHAT
True so let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Let's do that.	CHITCHAT
Let's make it I.	CHITCHAT
So for anyone curious is what I'm doing that's new.	CHITCHAT
I'm using the selection tool to create a circle to create a nice perfect eyeball.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Unlike Adobe draw fresco does not have a shape tool.	O
I've talked about this in the past and previous streams.	CHITCHAT
You can go through and watch.	CHITCHAT
I do some really in depth like.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
Walkthrough how I do this process.	CHITCHAT
To make like really nice circles, you can go watch.	CHITCHAT
Those it's pretty much what I'm doing right now.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, until they add a function like they had an Adobe draw or sketch where they have like a little shape tool you could pick some cool stuff.	O
This is kind of how you gotta do it.	O
Unfortunately, or at least the way that I found to do a best.	CHITCHAT
And let's see here another one.	O
People.	CHITCHAT
Skip and there, we go that's an animal.	O
So I hope everybody had a nice holiday.	CHITCHAT
Maybe everybody got some time off definitely excited to be back like I was saying at the beginning of the stream.	CHITCHAT
Kind of between Christmas and New Years and everything and visiting family have not been streaming as much as I wanted to, but I'm back going to be streaming a whole lot more.	CHITCHAT
Hoping to bring some new short form content to everybody so you have to sit there and watch.	CHITCHAT
These like longwinded streams.	CHITCHAT
You can start watching some short content.	CHITCHAT
That's maybe a little bit more engaging and fun.	CHITCHAT
So definitely follow me and stay tuned for that kind of stuff that will be coming out.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully soon who Bing I get some stuff up by the end of the month.	CHITCHAT
But you know.	CHITCHAT
The shorter streams take a little bit more time and.	CHITCHAT
Such as so I kind of Willy Nilly, like to actually like put some thought instruction behind it, so you actually learn something.	CHITCHAT
If there's anything anyone's ever interested in learning.	CHITCHAT
Do drop me a message man here on Behance like.	CHITCHAT
I respond people all the time.	CHITCHAT
You know if anyone is watching right now that's message me in the past.	CHITCHAT
But if anyone is they can probably contest too.	CHITCHAT
That's hit me up before they can definitely contest that I do respond.	CHITCHAT
I'm a real person.	CHITCHAT
You know, I like to reply and I like having conversations.	CHITCHAT
Right so let's try to do this like full want to do this.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing this backwards, let's hide that layer real quick.	O
The first is mouth.	O
Emma teeth are half circles.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
I should mention this, I was do the Top row 1st.	O
'Cause then my guys all get overbites and instead of Underbites.	O
I like that better for some reason.	CHITCHAT
Character number.	O
Sometimes you just get so stuck in like a flow like your own process.	CHITCHAT
That.	CHITCHAT
So anyone that's watching and TuneIn If you got any questions.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to ask, don't be shy.	CHITCHAT
I'm here to help.	CHITCHAT
Definitely want people to start to learn the different types of softwares.	CHITCHAT
Frescoes not just 'cause it's the one that I like to use the most it's not the only one I use.	CHITCHAT

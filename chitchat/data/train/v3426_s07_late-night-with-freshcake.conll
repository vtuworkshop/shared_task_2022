Oh boy mess this up 'cause I went down too far into the part of the beard.	O
Hold on folks layer.	CHITCHAT
Discovered Adobe capture waiting in Logan Airport, like way long ago.	CHITCHAT
Boston and I decided that.	CHITCHAT
Like I was going to try to like make brushes out of like elements that I found around the airport, which you know.	CHITCHAT
Seems like a good idea, but then you're just a weirdo with your Phone out walking around an airport just taking pictures of everything when you start to look kinda sketchy.	CHITCHAT
I did end up with some cool cool results, taking pictures like the rafters and stuff in the building so.	CHITCHAT
Harmony app to try that with it doesn't always work.	CHITCHAT
It definitely works.	CHITCHAT
Better to like kind of create something that you would just kind of like dab around on the screen, and used to make textures.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I'd make a brush that would be used as like something for like but I intend to actually drag across the screen, and paint with.	CHITCHAT
But it'll be capture is a pretty sweet app.	CHITCHAT
So you can do some cool stuff for that.	CHITCHAT
The pattern tool that is pretty rad.	CHITCHAT
Like you can take anything and turn it into like 70s wallpaper.	CHITCHAT
Alright gotta crazy looking person.	O
Looks kind of like a?	CHITCHAT
I said your name from the League rafi or whatever his name is.	CHITCHAT
The hilarious character with anyone here watch the League watch it for a little bit.	CHITCHAT
It was fun.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's let's hire rough sketch.	O
Let's put in some detail here.	O
It's kind of.	CHITCHAT
So 'cause the beard is all black we gotta.	O
Going to kind of paint in.	O
Little lips and stuff, and white so I'm actually just going to.	O
Use the sort of like circle.	O
I keep touching by the way it takes the brush are currently using and turns it into like an eraser.	O
Which is really cool function?	CHITCHAT
Little better right now here we go.	O
I like it a lot.	CHITCHAT
I've started using in a bunch.	O
And I kind of like it 'cause I can set my normal eraser.	O
Like the eraser tool here to something specific and then I can set like usually this race for tool set something like really large so I have, like a really bigger racer and then I'll use.	O
This my current brushes and eraser as well.	O
So I have 2 races and I can kind of switch between quicker and work, a little faster.	O
I want to have like a snarl kind of lip.	O
Will raise up that one too.	O
It looks kinda weird?	CHITCHAT
Maybe not it was leave the bottom lip.	O
There's like a little.	CHITCHAT
Something that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, go check out Adobe capture it's really rad.	O
There are some cool stuff in there like I said the pattern tool is pretty pretty pretty sweet.	O
Traffic I capture colors with it.	O
Actually, no, I use Adobe capture a whole lot.	O
When here, you know what I'm drawing on an iPad I can show you.	O
Mac Adobe capture.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I use it for all sorts of stuff, he's going to have a bunch of weird shapes and things 'cause.	O
I just take pictures of things, but I really like the colours alot on it, and I use this all the time to capture colors.	O
I go in constantly and will like you take pictures turn the Camera and take a picture or something.	O
Do real-time tutorial here people right Camera.	O
Oh, boy, it's going to get weird or here's my desk.	CHITCHAT
Could grab some colors from my Mac mini and things boom.	O
And it kind of, well, yeah, it'll sort of like create gradients and kind of give you some some cool stuff to kind of work with you can find like you know all different stuff look at the image.	O
You can kind of movies around in the image we got like a PlayStation controller over here.	O
And this is like a Super Wack fast tutorial and then you hit save.	CHITCHAT
It will save it as a color palette for you and it'll kind of it will throw it up into here and then you can have a color that you can access in your CC library, so it's really fun app highly recommend it.	O
There's other cool stuff in there, too, like OK now we're now we're now we're talking.	CHITCHAT

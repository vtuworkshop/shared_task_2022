Let's just go through this.	O
Let's see what other cool.	CHITCHAT
Things are there, you can make materials so like using the Camera.	O
You can take a picture or something and you can turn it into a 3D material for Adobe dimensions.	O
I never use type.	CHITCHAT
There's like this capture thing that you can take pictures and stuff like this shape here is.	O
I took a picture of the boardwalk in Atlantic City and it converts.	CHITCHAT
Oh no source image is not available.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's on this one.	CHITCHAT
'cause apparently I did two of 'em No.	CHITCHAT
No more source images.	CHITCHAT
Sorry this is the boardwalk from Atlantic City.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I did a paint splatter.	CHITCHAT
I took a picture of Instagram logo.	CHITCHAT
'cause I need it.	CHITCHAT
Some tattoo art that I found probably online.	CHITCHAT
But then you can also make patterns.	O
You can see like I took some of my characters and made these like wacky weird patterns out of this image here.	O
So yeah, you could do some really cool stuff with this, it's a.	O
It's a really rad rad app and then a lot of that stuff gets integrated often into the different you know Adobe apps.	O
You can access those libraries from your desktop on photo shop all that kind of stuff.	O
Yeah, highly recommend.	CHITCHAT
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
I wanna try to.	O
Take out like a big section of beard let's see.	O
This is the.	CHITCHAT
They will highlight.	O
Now I've got like skunk beer that's weird.	CHITCHAT
Nobody likes that would be like having a skunk beard.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Please forget like what tool I had selected last.	CHITCHAT
Classic issue.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I don't know if I'm digging the like weird skunk lines that I'm adding in here.	O
It just feels.	O
Odd.	O
You don't want to go back and we'll figure it out later.	CHITCHAT
Kind of like the full like density of the beard.	O
Something that's always kind of nice like in art and that I think everybody should always remember when you're drawing don't be afraid to just have like a large section of black space.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it kind of helps anchor your drawing and it kind of add something to it like I talked about this one of my previous streams.	CHITCHAT
It might actually been the last time it might have been the holiday, when I did over Christmas but.	CHITCHAT
When I was in Art School, something always did was take like a I think I have it one up here I do.	CHITCHAT
Take a drawing sketch a bunch of stuff out and then like take areas and just fill them in with black to try to help kind of anchor stuff like I said earlier like kind of helps this is another good one got a nice explicit.	O
If I'm here.	CHITCHAT
But you might have already super tiny, but then I kind of failed in these little nubs.	O
I don't know like fingers.	O
Some of 'em in black to kind of help.	O
Add in a little bit of like wait to the image so little little.	O
Take it for what it's worth little piece of.	CHITCHAT
Fresh cake advice so here let's duplicate this now, let's.	O
Duplicate let's merge.	O
Inside that let's put white behind it.	O
Bill good done.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
2 layer.	O
Wait vector emerged so I started doing this, too recently.	O
Merge down so I put a white solid behind and then.	O
I lose kind of like the white on the outside of shapes now.	O
This guys got like a fill so there, we go.	O
We kind of go transparent.	O
'Cause I started drawing in a lot of background kind of stuff and it's kind of nice to do what I just did because it makes it really easy to.	O
To add in any kind of background elements.	O
'cause now when I draw let's say get a black line here.	O
Now, when I draw I can just draw right behind him and I have to worry about erasing anything, it's kind of nice.	O
Let's see here I was trying to put something behind him.	O
I don't know what to put behind him.	O
Weird.	CHITCHAT
Swirly kind of motion.	O
I should have done a better rough sketch earlier.	CHITCHAT

What that looks so cool OK?	CHITCHAT
Don't answer the last question, we're sticking with purple.	O
We're going with.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
These little details that I made early on.	O
Sometimes it helps to like wait off on that stuff to the very end.	CHITCHAT
FY I kinda went a little too far, too fast in the beginning.	CHITCHAT
Because you have to go through and like keep tapping and redoing stuff.	CHITCHAT
We attach it with this, I'm just kidding.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really going to get 2 of us.	CHITCHAT
Hawaii would hold me to that, like fresh cake never got that tattoo.	CHITCHAT
Like a right.	CHITCHAT
OK let's see here.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Here we go right, so we're just adding some shading so the way that I'm doing this really quick.	O
I created a new layer and I just set the opacity at 10 and then I select the color of my line work and now I'm just kind of going through and just kind of adding in some some shading I.	O
I don't know I'm kind of torn on if I should fill this, dude in with color.	O
I normally do actually this kind of purple is working really well so make a whole will stick with it.	O
We're here, we're here, we're doing, it might as well.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Awesome sauce.	CHITCHAT
Back to this layer machine layer.	O
Yeah, so all I do is I take the color of the line work put on new layer turn down the Opacity and then just trace.	O
That's another machine and sometimes I get pretty crazy with it like there's some you can watch.	CHITCHAT
Some other streams like I'll kind of like go in and try to like really kind of create some sort of.	CHITCHAT
This guy.	CHITCHAT
Odd shaded shape like that.	O
You know just to kind of add something to it.	O
I think it'll work.	CHITCHAT
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there, we go.	O
Just kind of blocking like these big areas of shade.	O
Kinda messed up on the nose there close to close.	O
And something always to watch out for like I said that problem.	CHITCHAT
For a long time when I would like draw, I'd get like this on the iPad an like.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes you gotta step away and like look at something like that in its entire T.	O
You can't be like super granular and like in here trying to do.	O
That kind of stuff like it just happened to be the nose and I was trying to like figure out something that clearly wasn't working, because I was zoomed in super far.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	O
Make some shade on the nose.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
I have.	O
Paint bucket selected.	O
There it is.	O
You.	CHITCHAT
And now here.	O
The either shaded some shade on his face.	O
Alright let's put some highlights so highlights are the same way.	O
But I do one thing different I start with the Opacity set all the way to 100 and I draw my highlights.	O

Hide this layer right.	O
Want to.	CHITCHAT

I'm going quiet for a second here.	O
'cause I'm like I'm thinking through this big time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I want to resolve this hold on.	O
Here we go.	O
I think everyone right now is like what is happening.	CHITCHAT
Promise it's going to look good.	CHITCHAT
For restarting from scratch nothing's getting.	CHITCHAT
What I want to do is I want to separate this like background shape that I created?	O
Because.	O
Wanna have some more control of it?	O
So I can do things like that.	CHITCHAT
Make it brighter or whatever.	O
Just sort of hidden.	O
So it's like I said earlier this is the fun part for me like I love this part trying to explore and see what I can do push stuff.	CHITCHAT
She did.	CHITCHAT
I think I like the lighter highlights that.	O
Yeah, I think we got something here.	CHITCHAT
Alright so let's take all this, let's take this character.	O
Let's just put everything into one group.	O
Its name are liars build.	O
Wow, this line work.	CHITCHAT
Line work.	O
Rough.	O

EKG shade.	O
Dome.	O
Always important to label your layers like I can't stress that enough it's something that I'm really.	O
I wanna make this really bad at.	O
Air highlight but super important 'cause when you pass projects off to other artists like you want them to know what they're doing, and where they're clicking.	O
The singer Spec thing and also like it's just good practice cool and we can put these guys together.	O
'cause they're hidden.	O
There we go, we got ourselves a sweet character.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Dude, just chilling.	CHITCHAT
This inspired me to try to grow a big fool burly man beard and lose some hair up Top, wow.	CHITCHAT
I've lost a lot of hair on Top already so I don't know how much more I can lose but.	CHITCHAT
You know to get his level.	CHITCHAT
I think that actually have to grow hair out on Top to get to this.	CHITCHAT
So to start growing hair.	CHITCHAT
Go buy some rogaine.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, this is uh.	CHITCHAT
I'd say that we're pretty much there.	O
The only thing I do want to do is grab this color.	O
Go over here.	O
Fill this part in so that it matches.	O
And we're done that's it boom.	O
Oh, wait.	CHITCHAT
No, we're not done.	O
What am I saying we're not done.	CHITCHAT
We're not done there, we go.	CHITCHAT

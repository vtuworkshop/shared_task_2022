I feel like.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Are we stable yet?	CHITCHAT
I'm uh I'm losing frames like crazy.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what the problem is.	CHITCHAT
Let's try let's see if we're looking alright here.	CHITCHAT
Let's try movement tests, Yeah Laggy, it is.	CHITCHAT
Hi everybody, um welcome.	CHITCHAT
I need to turn on something 1st and uh.	CHITCHAT
I will do that now wherever it went hold on a second.	CHITCHAT
Hold on a second.	CHITCHAT
Tool timeline that's right the tool timeline will pop that bad boy on real quick?	CHITCHAT
How are y'all doing today?	CHITCHAT

And today we're going to do what is written right here.	CHITCHAT
Man my Camera is all over the place to just give me one second.	CHITCHAT
Give me one second?	CHITCHAT
How are you all doing today?	CHITCHAT
I don't know why my night stand is visible.	CHITCHAT
Now it's never usually visible there.	CHITCHAT
We go that's better.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be working with some screentones today and the reason I'm doing that is because it is contextually relevant to what I'm working on personally.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I've been working on my own little comic for the last while it's been awhile since I've started working on it, I guess I can get rid of our.	O
Let me let me get rid of this.	CHITCHAT
We don't need this anymore.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
But working on a comic for awhile and as you may know some of you may not most of you probably won't have a big fan of manga manga anime.	O
Stuff like that, but mostly the art in manga.	CHITCHAT
It's insane looking at the history of manga using screentones and not using screentones manually doing hand toning with like cross hatching.	O
Even a little bit of Point Alyssum.	CHITCHAT
It's insane.	CHITCHAT
It really is.	CHITCHAT
It's crazy.	CHITCHAT
And now we're in what 2020 now.	CHITCHAT
Welcome to 2020 years going well by the way.	CHITCHAT
Now that we're in 2020 and it's been this way for about 2.	CHITCHAT
Decades now but we have access to water called computers in computers, are fantastic.	CHITCHAT
They allow you to do all kinds of really handy stuff that would be otherwise really tedious to do manually with traditional work so.	CHITCHAT
That brings me to screen tones and screen tones for those of you unaware.	CHITCHAT
I imagine most of you are aware but a lot of people probably aren't as well.	CHITCHAT

Screen tones are basically implying grayscale value like from black to white and not even just grayscale.	O
But just value in general really you can use colored screen tones that's totally valid.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
They're meant to imply value by density and what I can do to kind of show you what I mean here is I'll use a very simple brush and I'll put a couple of these dots together here will zoom in a little bit closer.	O
And depending on how close and big.	O
These dots are.	O
They will imply.	O
A different level of value also I'll just drop a few dots in here and I'm going to get fewer.	O
I can't really make a much smaller because well, we're actually working at a pretty small resolution here.	O
But basically if we just put a couple in between.	O
These dots here as we go back there's a whole like math and logic to all this that.	O
I'm not too familiar with, but I will touch on that a little bit as we go along.	O
But yeah, as as I kind of fill these in you can see that it's not a very good example right now, but basically at a distance.	O
This area looks a bit darker in this looks a bit lighter and that's the whole principle to screen tones.	O
It's pretty simple to be completely honest.	CHITCHAT
But it can be a very complicated.	CHITCHAT
Thing there's a lot of much like any form of Art.	CHITCHAT
Watercolor acrylics crosshatching all those different things that fall into really any category.	CHITCHAT
Can appear simple but very rapidly get complicated and have a lot of contextual decisions to make?	CHITCHAT
Technical aspects as well all of which I will do my best to cover today on the stream.	CHITCHAT
An I'm not a pro.	CHITCHAT
I don't know everything there is to know about Screentones and this is a learning experience for me as well.	CHITCHAT
Hey Turtle, how's it going?	CHITCHAT
You're using?	CHITCHAT
Uh your anonymous turtle handle today?	CHITCHAT
I saw you on Ryan stream like a couple months back and you had your own professional.	CHITCHAT
Handle much like I am here now how you doing.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you came by Are you ready to learn about screentones I sure AM.	CHITCHAT
A couple of things I want to talk about for screentones.	O
There's going to be these custom brushes.	O
Similar already have the Kyle brushes specifically that come with your creative cloud subscription.	O
So if you've got the creative cloud subscription.	O
You can go to like I think it's the exchange Adobe exchange.	O
It could pick up all these brushes that I'm going today.	O
I'm sure there's more, but what I have right now is probably sufficient.	O
And then also in Enjun solutions to making screen tones and I don't want to simply say screentones halftones are also going to fall into this category, and they get a little bit more.	O
Diverse and their usage typically screentones as the name goes are just grayscale screen tones, primarily for doing illustrations and black and white and.	O
And actually got this little illustration here where you can see.	O
I've actually used some screentones practically.	O
It's really hard to tell.	CHITCHAT
I know I'm sorry, but you can maybe see a little bit of dots there and those dots are there.	O
They're not part of the the cameras lack of quality those are actually little dots to make up a grayscale value.	O
So I've got about 2 hours today before I have to go.	CHITCHAT
And I will do my best to cover most of the basics and also talk about some examples to first of all I'm going by the way Journal.	CHITCHAT
There's a tremendous amount of latency between what I say, and when you hear it.	CHITCHAT
So I said that about.	CHITCHAT
3 minutes ago so there's roughly at 3 minute gap.	CHITCHAT
So hopefully that's not to interrupt if.	CHITCHAT
This is the beta program so I'm guessing that as they roll out more official stuff.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be a lot tighter at least I hope so.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure it's mostly Codex and things like that.	CHITCHAT
But That being said, I'm going to follow.	O
These exactly as I have a drawn out here and I'm actually working on a?	O
A format for an actual thing that I need to keep clean so let me just make a new save up here and will get back to it.	O
OK.	O
I had talked about perhaps.	CHITCHAT
I'm going back to value paintings or something today or I talked about my next stream and maybe that but I think this might be a little bit more fun and a little bit more relevant to what I'm working on right now, but yeah, so custom screentones.	CHITCHAT
Basically, you can make your own screentones.	O
If you want to now.	CHITCHAT
I watched a remember who it was, but what they've done is they made a pattern.	O

And then they just did the shift F5 fill with their own pattern.	O
We're going to do something similar here.	O
I've got a couple already there.	O
Maybe not ideal for this particular project.	CHITCHAT
But I will breakdown how to make your own screentones.	O
First, we're going to go through a very like loosen rough example of each of these 3 things here and then we'll break down to some more specific examples now.	O
Unfortunately, a lot of the Times that you can find.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Manga or things like that online or other screen tones that have been used.	O
There typically super low quality.	O
So the examples.	O
All have won't be all that useful because they just kind of look like grayscale values.	O
But I will try to share as best as I can some good examples.	CHITCHAT
OK so how to make a custom screen to know what I'm going to do right now is just make a selection here hit shift F5 to open up your fill options.	O
I've seen people I've seen people go to like edit Phil and like it just it.	O
Hurts me so ship 5 is the way to go for doing an actual feel like this and I'll select custom pattern contents pattern, custom pattern.	O
Now, this is a pattern that I've made already.	O
And I will go through the process of making the pattern as well.	O
But since I've got some ready to go go and open one up.	O
I don't know if these are going to look at or not, but we do have these guys.	CHITCHAT
These are basically 5 simple circles in a die pattern and I'm just going to press OK and they're a little bit weird.	O
But there you go you get basically what is the screen tone and that's oversimplified for sure.	O
And these are huge too.	O
I think I was actually using these for different project, not necessarily screentone related and that's why they were a little bit weird, but look through a couple more that I have here I think this one might be a good one.	O
That's also very huge very awkward as well, but that's fine.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
And this is just a single dot which will end up looking like that.	O
I'm not a professional for using patterns in photo shop, so please bear with me as I work on this.	CHITCHAT
But what I'm going to do is.	CHITCHAT
This is for the people who just want to see the info and get out.	CHITCHAT
'Cause I know there's a lot of tutorials.	CHITCHAT
This is not a story by the way this is just kind of meh experimenting on my own but also trying to share my knowledge as I go along too.	CHITCHAT
But for people who want to just see what I have to have to say, and then get out.	CHITCHAT
Basically, we're going to make a very small piece of our pattern.	O
These are very bad dots or the screen tones, but will probably work nonetheless.	O
Will just make a quick 3 by 3 little box here and we're going to make a selection?	O
And then what you can do is go to edit.	O
Define pattern and will just call this 3 by 3 dots.	O
OK.	O
And that's pretty much it so now, what I can do is make a selection here shift F5 and then find my 3 by 3 dots here.	O
And then press OK and there, you go you get a very loose screentone.	O
Let me see if I have any illustrations that would be good, too.	CHITCHAT
To use as an example.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I need to open bridge up I think.	O
As it turns out looking at photo shop icons doesn't really help.	CHITCHAT
That's gag in the sense of like a joke.	CHITCHAT
Not like something else don't worry.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Uhm yeah, I've got will work with.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Which of these would be a good example I think that?	CHITCHAT
Maybe this one.	CHITCHAT
Will try this one out or maybe?	CHITCHAT
Let me find a better example, something a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Generic.	CHITCHAT
I tell myself that I'd like to prepare my.	CHITCHAT
My stuff in advance.	CHITCHAT
But it's rare that are actually do so there, you go.	CHITCHAT
OK, I've got some Fox is here that I've that I've studied.	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at these Fox is going to add some screentones with these guys so they're not quite.	O
Not quite the cleanest there we go.	O
But they'll work.	O
Let me just make these flat black.	O
And what I basically do for this is there's a couple of options.	O
You have the option.	O

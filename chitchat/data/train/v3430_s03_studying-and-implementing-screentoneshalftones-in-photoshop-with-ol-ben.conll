I like the most is to fill your entire canvas with your screen tone pattern.	O
Like like this.	CHITCHAT
Just fill the whole thing of course, we do have the issue of.	O
The White Alpha was retained from the from the initial initial creation of the pattern, which is unfortunate, but we can do a multiply and that will make it so that you can see right through the white.	O
So what you can do now is make a Hey, Leslie, Oh, cool fantastic.	CHITCHAT
I'm hoping that this will be a handy thing to follow along with I hesitate to call dictatorial but.	CHITCHAT
So now we have a very rough stream till made simply of our 3 by 3 dots, but now, what we can do is fill the whole canvas make a mask and then fill the mask using I think it's the black.	O
Oh, fantastic, Hey, how's it going lenardo?	CHITCHAT
Is that Leonardo yeah?	CHITCHAT
I think it?	CHITCHAT
Is isn't it?	CHITCHAT
So now that we filled the whole camp with black everything is invisible to black doesn't allow any light through that's kind of the idea of a mask.	O
I won't talk too much about the masks because that's a whole topic with of its own.	CHITCHAT
But what we can do now is erase the mask.	O
And that will reveal the screentone using white that is, we won't erase it will paint it with white that will get rid of the mask and now we can just.	O
Cut away the spots with the screen to show through.	O
And it will start to take effect and again this is a very crude way of doing it.	O
You can definitely put the effort in put the effort into your screen to look nice experiment with Densities, which is a big factor of a screen tone?	O
How close your dots are together and also how large the dots are too.	O
I tend to prefer something that's not too big but also not too small.	O
Typically, I feel like if you can see the individual dots at a full view on your display.	O
There may be a bit too big so I like to keep him a little bit smaller and a little bit tighter.	O
Let me make a additional screentone real quick.	O
And I'm going to get rid of my white background too.	O
So we have an issue with the Alpha anymore.	O
Although the Alpha might will find out will find out in a second.	O
So I'm going to get a hard round brush at a size of one and we're basically to be making pixel art here.	O
I'll make a couple do a 5 by 5.	O
And this is going to be an incredibly dark and dense screentone.	O
But I want to show you all what that will kind of look like now remember when you're making your selection.	O
The space around your object will also be included in the in the pattern, too, so that will definitely make an obvious and weird gap between your patterns.	O
Especially if something's tight and geometric is this So what I want to do is make sure that I get basically a pixel.	O
I want to get a space the width of the dot.	O
Around the selection here that way they should be able to connect up just right well actually will make only half of it have the gap as it makes sense because we only want this width here to space.	O
The two selections apart.	O
If you have it equidistant around the entire T of the selection.	O
It will have a 2 wide gap.	O
So you want to make sure that one side is one set off another one is not.	O
It's not what we'll do is go to edit defined pattern and will call this one.	O
Screentone example to about that.	O
So we're going to go back to our Fox is here make a new layer and then fill that layer with the new pattern.	O
We just made and that should look alright.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can see we get an ice equidistant pattern of pixels basically.	O
And will make a new mask will fill it with black and now, what I can do.	O
Is unlock the mask from the layer?	O
Which will allow us to move the layer itself really in the mask won't be interrupted so I'm going to do that because what I want to do.	O
Let's erase or clear out the mask again here.	O
So we can see the Fox.	O
I was feeling like these dots are a bit too.	O
Small So what I'm going to do is actually scale it up once I get him in place.	O
So remember, we're racing the mask were not painting anything here were just clearing the mask.	O
By doing this we're not actually affecting the image at all.	O
Now what I can do is select.	O
Here, the actual layer.	O
And now if I move this and scale it.	O
It will work independently of the mask below well, I guess the mask above in this case so I'll scale it out roughly to 200% and we can see the screen.	O

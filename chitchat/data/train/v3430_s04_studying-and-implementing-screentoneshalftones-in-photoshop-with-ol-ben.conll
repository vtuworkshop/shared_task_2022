Tones are a lot bigger now you will get issues with distortion and what's called Moray.	O
And I think it's more a It's MOREI think there's like an accent on the E as well.	CHITCHAT
Why are maybe I don't know I've seen people say foray into more as like a learning example so it might be more right.	CHITCHAT
But you will get weird distortions when you scale and shrink and expand and change your screen tones and ice box.	O
Fox.	O
Box box.	O
So that the Maury stuff is a whole thing in its own an I'm not very knowledgeable on that I've only just learned about it actually but it will be a big issue when you work on like shrinking your images down to share them online.	O
If you're a smart artist to work at a high DPI at a higher resolution and then shrink it after.	O
Well, I guess, saying good artist based on that is a little bit, too, narrow to say.	CHITCHAT
But if you want to have nice clean artwork.	O
You'll typically work at high resolution and then you shrink it down.	O
It will change your screen tones, so that's a factor to keep in mind as well so that's a very quick and brief look into making custom screentones.	O
I'm not going to save these changes.	O
I'll keep the Fox is open actually will go ahead and close that.	O
The next thing that we talked about are the Kyle brushes and the Kyle brushes are like I said earlier included with your?	O
Creative Cloud subscription you can go to the exchange and you can get all these brushes to follow along with if you want.	O
An I'm not going to talk about how to like add the brushes.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to show you where to get him.	CHITCHAT
It's not really the topic of the stream today, but you can find no problem.	CHITCHAT
If you look.	CHITCHAT
But once you've loaded the brushes.	O
You'll be able to access them in your?	O
And your brushes here we've got a few there are all labeled with the prefix of Kyle's so you know exactly which ones are, which I prefer to look at my brushes this way.	O
But I think for the sake of this go and show the stroke and.	O
What kind of scale this up a bit too, so you can see a little bit more specifically the brush I'm working with.	O
I don't like to work and this format specifically.	O
It's too.	CHITCHAT
There's too few brushes at once, but it's really handy for.	O
For president in.	O
Scale this up a little bit more.	O
If if Photoshop allows it.	CHITCHAT
It's very possible just crashed I may have to relaunch it.	CHITCHAT
I will say I don't know I don't know what the issue is I look at it, it caught up.	CHITCHAT
Uh the Kyle brushes in 2020 photo shop 2020 have seem to cause me some issues, where it will just kind of freeze.	CHITCHAT
My engine for a while.	CHITCHAT
My my photo shop and I don't know what the causes and I don't know if there's other like related issues to that that I don't know about.	CHITCHAT
But just bear that in mind.	CHITCHAT
If you work with the gold rush is just in general.	CHITCHAT
I'd recommend saving right away and often because I'll often work on a project and not know if I like it.	CHITCHAT
Until it's frozen and I have to lose it so.	CHITCHAT
Make sure you save in your stuff that's just a general rule that always be saving your stuff.	CHITCHAT
I grew up in a in a time playing games, where there wasn't autosave yet to save manually.	CHITCHAT
Whenever you wanted to save your game and you think with that history.	CHITCHAT
I would know to just be like constantly saving stuff, but still.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
So the Kyle brushes.	O
While there are a good assortment of regular inking type brushes very good traditional feeling brushes in a lot of ways.	O
It does come with a pack of.	O
Filled tones as well, and these are a little bit.	O
More thought out than the ones I just showed you they have a texture.	O
That's applied and it will be consistent.	O
No matter how many times you pick your brush up so that texture is always going to be hanging out there.	O
And no matter how much you paint over Top of it, it won't go away, and their pressure, based as well.	O
Anne what that will do is if you press hard.	O
It'll fill dark and as you lighten up and you go across your canvas.	O
Will get a little less dense so you can get some nice loosen rough tones here and there.	O
No big deal.	CHITCHAT
It's been pretty good, and you can build him up.	CHITCHAT
If you want as well.	CHITCHAT
And that's a really important aspect that I love.	CHITCHAT
But I think it's a bit sensitive for me.	O
Sometimes I just want to apply a smooth casual flat tone here and I'll get little variations like right in here, you can see little variations that well can be kind of cool as like an organic look too.	O

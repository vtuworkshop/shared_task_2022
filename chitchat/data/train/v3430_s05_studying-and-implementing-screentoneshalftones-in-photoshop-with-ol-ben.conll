It's got a very hand painted feeling to it.	O
If you just want a nice clean tone.	O
It's kind of tough to get.	O
Now there's probably a way what you can do is you can actually click with your mouse and you can get some.	O
Depending on hard you click you can get some much lighter tones, but again, it's really tough to get it just right and I don't know of a way to fill a specific level of the tone either.	O
So you're kind of stuck with what my solution is to make a selection of what I want to tone and then make a really big brush and just gently touch over Top of it and that kind of works for Maine for some people with like less powerful computers.	O
These brushes when they're very large can take some time to render so it might.	O
Make you have to spend like a good you know 4 or 5 minutes waiting for the filled happen.	O
So this is something to bear in mind.	CHITCHAT
But these are really great tones.	CHITCHAT
I like him a lot there.	CHITCHAT
A lot handier than some of my other methods and they're already there, so win win win in my opinion.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to make a couple of selections here.	O
I'm going to show you a couple of.	O
Gradients done the Screentone.	O
As best as I can.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, see pressure sensitive stuff on it, it's it's a.	O
Pretty sharp cut off.	O
Very gently try to modify how hard I'm pressing without.	O
Too hard.	O
OK, there and you can see this is a good example.	O
Now I've not really shown a good example of how these screentones can look like actual gradients actual proper grayscale values at a distance and that is the whole point.	O
As an experiment I'll make a red brush.	O
And you can see I initially said it was.	O
Screentones were for grayscale values, but this can also apply to other values as well doesn't have to be limited just entirely too.	O
Black and white but you can actually use colors and a lot of people will very actively do that.	O
They'll make that a point to make their skin tones.	O
Have a different Hue or saturation for a very specific reason.	O
And those are all the screens.	O
We have screen tones are cool because you can basically turn anything into a screen tone and you can make like a house or a background over tree.	O
There are a couple of more simple patterns.	O
Which ones do we have?	CHITCHAT
We have these crosshatches?	O
What the crosshatches here?	CHITCHAT
Which basically couldn't be used as like a chain link fence or just another type of appearance pretty flexible.	O
And again, these are all the cow brushes, which are available with creative cloud.	O
They're not paying me to say that I just wanted you guys to be very.	CHITCHAT
Very clear on where to get these guys because I think if you if you've got a creative.	CHITCHAT
Cloud subscription and you're not using the call brushes.	CHITCHAT
You're kind of like like these brushes alone are probably worth a monthly subscription to be completely honest, they're really great.	CHITCHAT
They do have their drawbacks, but you can fix those very easily.	O
Because you have the brush settings that you can change, so you know if maybe you don't want to have a size jitter based on Prem pressures turn it up turn it up.	O
You know it's just complete control.	O
It's super handy.	O
I might be something to think about though for flat tones.	O
And then I will now jump into the photo shop methods of making your own screen tones.	O
And that can be done fairly easily.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit of of an awkward situation in some ways, but in other ways.	CHITCHAT
If you just kind of do it.	CHITCHAT
It's not a big deal.	CHITCHAT
I think I've got my.	CHITCHAT
It's alright OK, we're going to make a quick screen tone here.	O
I say Screeton, a gradient here.	O
This is a very clearly black to white with grey zone between and.	O
The important thing about a gradient is the gradual change from one value to the next.	O
And you can do that with screentones normally but this is another way of doing it.	O
So what you can do is take your grayscale and this could be anything.	O
I want to show you before.	O
We actually get into that.	O
Let me make a very brief rough grayscale not.	O
It is all thank you.	O
That dissolves are great will get into that.	O
At some point.	O
Those are in my opinion very relevant through screentones will just drop in like a very rough, something rather here.	O
See we've got like a a dark area and then maybe the foreground here could be a nice bright light bulb.	O
Just a light bulb here imagine that imagine it with me.	O
I know it's a bit tough to see but it's a light bulb.	CHITCHAT

And now you got a nice screentone there and it's fantastic.	O
Now it can look a little bit artificial.	O
No, the The Moray isn't what you want turtle that's the problem.	O
You don't want them or a?	O
The the wire.	O
I don't know how it's meant to be pronounced that's the problem.	CHITCHAT
It happens, you'll get like Plaid textures at a certain resolution.	O
I've got, I think it's here.	CHITCHAT
This is from Chapter 5, so if you might have actually deleted the one that had the yeah look at look at this guys hair here for example, you can kind of see, there's a bit of a Plaid texture, and that's caused by shrinking the.	O
Shrinking the screen tones down and that's really in a lot of cases, not what you want so that's the main wire.	O
The Moray that you want to try to avoid if you can.	O
And you can kind of solve that in one of two ways.	O
I'm not going to talk about it just yet 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I want to also show off a couple of different methods of making screen tones.	O
One that you can do, I've not really worked with this myself.	CHITCHAT
I've not found it to be very useful.	CHITCHAT
But if you want.	O
This particular look.	O
You can go with it.	O
I think it's under pixelate.	O
Color halftone and this will use colors and it's a little bit weird, too, but you can get some halftone looks out of it this way.	O
And I think what we can do is actually going to filter.	O
Thankfully halftone these channels here are going to be colors, so I think it would just zeros or maybe.	O
Moving maxes out 255.	O
It will come back as being just black and I'll set this Max radius to 2.	O
It needs to have 127.	O
Maybe just having him all the same will work.	O
Yeah, that works so that's one way of doing it.	O
And again that's filter.	O
No pixelate color halftone and these are all set to 0 right now and if you choose like a smaller number or bigger number of little change the size of these dots.	O
Let's make another gradient here.	O
Will do a radial from the inside out like that or the opposite rather?	O
Just like how about that looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
I'll make a selection if you make a selection.	O
The filter will only apply that selection, so I'll do I think it's control.	O
Alt F to reapply my filter set it to 4 and then you get a nice a nice dinner.	O
There, too, so that's one option there.	O
And again if you do want to add some colors, you can change, these around.	O
And this should be.	CHITCHAT
I think it's RGB an Alpha.	O
I don't know what all the four channels are 4 typically was just 3 the red blue and green so the last might be either the Alpha or the key or it might be a CMYK, which I guess the key in the Alpha kind of the same thing, but that Channel 4.	O
It's for something.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I can teach you how to use these color halftones to this to this degree, but the default settings are probably work alright.	O
And you can get some cool colored values and their two if you want if that's what you're looking for again.	O
Screentones, you can get a lot of mileage out of him.	O
There's a lot of flexibility.	O
You can have a lot of fun with them.	CHITCHAT
Lots of stuff you can do, but there's also.	CHITCHAT
Eh.	CHITCHAT
Well, you just have all these pixeling options in here, which can be used for different things point, the lights might be cool.	O
Get a little preview here.	O
I don't really know what this is trying to do looks like it's kind of similar to the halftone, but maybe not.	O
Will set this cell size to like 4 and just see what it does?	O
Looks kind of like bacteria filter got it will take a look there.	O
Good good show.	CHITCHAT
Let me take a peek.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what they've got.	CHITCHAT
Would that be for a mosaic is that?	O
What you had in mind.	O
It could be under like textured whoa that's an interesting work isn't it.	O
Mosaic is there Stainglass, I'm not actually seen is this a new one or is this one.	CHITCHAT
I'm just not aware of.	CHITCHAT
What is that when called?	O
Halftone pattern.	O
Look you there and articulation as well, it's not quite right, but halftone pattern there.	O
Let's see if I can change the size Oh that's interesting.	O
It seems a little bit low user kind of cool aren't they?	O
I've not ever seen these before.	CHITCHAT
Are these new?	CHITCHAT
I think he's a little bit smaller.	O

I want to see though there's the one aspect, though I've actually not getting black or white.	O
These are actually grazed too.	O
So this does have Gray values in there as well.	O
But I guess you could double up on your filters if you do that again.	O
Or rather do a pixelate halftone.	O
I'm going to 0 these out again.	O
We might get like a stacked effect that looks kind of gross doesn't it.	O
Maybe if I change the cell size to 2 for that it needs to be 4 OK, you can't go any.	O
Any smaller than four with that one.	O
So then maybe what we can do is copy it and take it back over here.	O
How to get rid of this?	CHITCHAT
Get rid of all that stuff there.	O
And go back to grayscale.	O
Hitman.	O
That actually is very similar results to the color halftone method.	O
Kind of looks like a face doesn't it?	CHITCHAT
It's kind of creepy isn't it?	CHITCHAT
So there's a couple of ways to make your halftones.	O
Lots of ways to go about it.	O
One other method, I've used is I've actually made fulfills and then halftone them not just fills but also gradients of different levels, which has resulted with me, having quite a few different types of custom screen tones that I've made personally and I use these for quick convenience.	O
And I will briefly go into these guys so these are all named after their pixel density and what they do.	O
I don't really have it seems like my lightest Gray, which I have here seems like my lightest Gray is still pretty dark, so not quite got alot.	O
Of a huge, huge value range, but it is a value range.	O
Nonetheless, and this is going to operate very similarly to the first making your own pattern method that I talked about earlier just that.	O
This is a little bit more streamlined and a little bit more efficient and a little bit more I think.	O
Cleaner.	O
And these are screentones kind of made through photo shops bitmap algorithm so they aren't quite dots.	O
But they are pretty consistent and pretty handy.	O
You typically want to have your harness for your brushes when you use the masks at 100% because screen tones are either on or off and if you have isoft and soften the edge to your brush you will get some grayscale elements which is not really what you want.	O
And how I'd say go as far as using the pencil because that will never have.	O
Any feathering to it.	O
Now, some things to avoid when working with Screentones.	O
Typically, unless you know what you're doing, and let's see know about how the screen.	O
Tones work intimately you'll typically want to avoid overlapping screentones.	O
Because then you'll get definitely this is more a pattern.	O
I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
But this might actually be.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there, it is there, it is see that's the problem there.	O
You'll get weird overlap and your initial screen tones will look different and if you zoom out of zoom in or scaling weirdly they will get strange affect supplied to them that you don't want to have so typically you want to try to avoid stacking screentones and less you know what you're doing.	O
There is a way to do it.	O
I don't know what that method is not right now at least.	O
It's a whole math in and of itself.	CHITCHAT
And I'm not I'm not at a place in my life where I want to care about it that much at the moment but at some point I probably learned how to do it.	CHITCHAT
And when I do.	CHITCHAT
I'll tell you I'll come back and I'll share everything guys.	CHITCHAT
But you can maybe get away with just like bumping up the edges of the screen.	O
Tones together that might be an option as well.	O
But once it starts to cross those lines, it will make the image darker.	O
It will accomplish that but it can look a bit gross so how do we deal with the Moray?	O
I've seen a couple of solutions.	O
The first of which seems to be the most convenient easiest method of doing it is to just add a slight blur before you shrink your screen tones, so we can merge these together.	O
The name my ruler again and.	O
Hold on a second.	O

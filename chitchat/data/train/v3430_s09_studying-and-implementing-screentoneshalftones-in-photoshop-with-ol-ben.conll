Actually want to fill this in a little bit more.	O
I wanted to be more obvious what's happening here, so we make this a bit bigger.	O
Will get this Fox 2?	O
Will make him totally tone deaf?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
This will combine these 2 and first thing to do is right away.	O
I'm just going to shrink this down.	O
So we're going to go to image size and I'm going to have this percentage wise.	O
And you can see we get all kinds of weird stuff going on 1st of all.	CHITCHAT
It's Gray now don't know why that happened, I think that's the compression algorithm at work there.	O
Let me undo that and I'm going to change the compression from by linear to nearest neighbor, which is good for pixel art action.	O
And the screen turns are kind of pixel already so I think that it applies here too.	O
And you can see that.	O
From what I can tell it just completely ate the light.	O
The lighter screen tone.	O
It just gone not even there anymore.	O
You can maybe see like remnants in this tone here.	O
Maybe not it just gone doesn't even exist anymore.	O
There.	CHITCHAT
And now it's not so how do you fix that?	CHITCHAT
Well, let's try this out?	CHITCHAT
Let me go to filter and then blur and then Gaussian blur and we want it to be a very small amount not a huge amount just a small enough amount.	O
That, it makes them a little bit more anti aliased.	O
It's tough to see but there's definitely a couple of different grade skills in here.	O
I know it is tough to see though.	CHITCHAT
So now let's try shrinking this down.	O
We'll see if it goes away.	CHITCHAT
It had hit harder time alright.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
But I can assure you if you shrink it down.	O
You won't get your maurey patterns anymore.	O
Well, there's that.	CHITCHAT
Not a good example, but not any other thoughts.	CHITCHAT
I have before I move on to examples.	CHITCHAT
It's not really.	CHITCHAT
I'll show off a couple of these patterns here.	O
I've got a deviant art account under the name.	CHITCHAT
Lt Tim if you can find that I've got these packs there, I might actually upload.	CHITCHAT
This pack to my Behance page as well, but you know, I made the effort of making these.	CHITCHAT
And just given away might be a little bit, too, generous, but got these clouds here any photograph.	CHITCHAT
You can take you can pretty much make a screen tone out of which is pretty handy.	O
These are some clouds.	O
I took a photo of for example.	O
Been more visible like this and it will take some time when you're experimenting with making your own, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like the Fox?	CHITCHAT
Is there a little study.	CHITCHAT
I did, but they'd be a good example.	CHITCHAT
You can basically turn any photograph into a screen tone.	O
But if you're not careful.	O
It'll look really stiff and that's the biggest factor of using an automatic algorithm to make your screen tones and I'll just look really kind of stiff not ideal, but you don't really get a lot of options, sometimes because.	O
You know, making clouds is hard enough on its own.	O
And doing it with just screentones like if you're gonna make this yourself.	O
It's just a nightmare.	CHITCHAT
So I find nothing wrong with just using these if using this background elements.	O
It's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
Some people like to implement full on screen tones.	CHITCHAT
Liechtenstein I think he was like around what like the 70s.	CHITCHAT
Let me take a peek.	CHITCHAT
Liechtenstein.	CHITCHAT
Not not the country.	CHITCHAT
But the artist when was he a thing?	CHITCHAT
Early wow.	CHITCHAT
He was born in the early 20s.	CHITCHAT
Impressive but he's responsible for.	CHITCHAT
If you've been to art school.	CHITCHAT
You've probably seen it before.	CHITCHAT
Like these.	CHITCHAT
These pop tarts.	CHITCHAT
And these will be much more half Tony than screentone.	CHITCHAT
But using a lot more visible screentone patterns.	CHITCHAT
I think like think of the name Screentone.	CHITCHAT

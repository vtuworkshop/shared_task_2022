I imagine that what they did is they just had like a screen and they painted over Top of it a very literal screen to get these effects and that's kind of where the root of all this is from and that's super cool and I think, but it is different than like a screen tone done for manga, they don't.	O
Well, they do.	O
I don't know how screentones originated in the manga sense, but this is pretty much like.	CHITCHAT
Imagine a sheet of metal with like holes all throughout it and then they put that down and paint over Top of it.	CHITCHAT
And that's how they get these colors.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, one of the Founding Fathers that imagined of contemporary western screentones alot of comics from like Marvel, like Batman and Superman used this technique.	CHITCHAT
A lot and I guess you know Wonder Woman, here as you can probably tell.	CHITCHAT
And these are much more aggressively used screentones, making a point to show them off and there are a few brushes that you can get that I have for example, that can actually achieve this goal.	O
I don't remember where I got this brush pack from so you'll have to forgive me for not being able to provide a resource to that, but I've got a few.	CHITCHAT
Half Tony brushes here and these are great but they're a little bit weird, too, because unlike the Kyle brushes.	O
They don't.	CHITCHAT
They don't tile at all.	O
They kind of stack on each other so you'll get a weird build up like this, where you might not like it and in some cases, it's kind of nice but typically the use cases I have from my screen tones don't involve overlapping textures, now you could solve that probably by.	O
Well, the method.	O
I'm thinking of just ends up with Kyle Brush, but you could make these dots.	O
Just like build him up a little bit.	O
Maybe use your mouse actually to get a good click, and just choose that circle.	O
And then we just make a little pattern out of it.	O
And then you could save that pattern and just do a filled with that, but then again, you would just get a Kyle Brush at noon.	O
Today I think so.	CHITCHAT
You could say have like a character here for like an object.	O
I'll make like an egg.	O
The result brush.	O
Don't know what's going on my brushes that little annoying.	CHITCHAT
Got an egg got nyseg pretend.	CHITCHAT
Pretend it's an egg.	O
And now we can go back to this screen tone here this halftone brush and just do a fill.	O
When you get that effect.	O
Pretty straightforward.	O
And then if you're careful you can line up just right like that.	O
The overlap cleanly as an option you have for sure.	O
Do a couple of fills here in there.	O
And you kind of get the screen tons are thinking of.	O
Yeah, good question, I don't know I don't have any knowledge on like Western Screentones.	CHITCHAT
I think for mostly manga stuff, it must have been to save on time because you know if you're manually dotting everything.	CHITCHAT
It's going to take you like literally months to finish a single page of of any of any artwork.	CHITCHAT
You're working on so I don't know what the western reason was, I imagine it's mostly stylistic, though.	CHITCHAT
I have no idea, though, will have to look it up together.	CHITCHAT
So you can get some more stylistic looks with halftones and of course, you can always use colors.	O
I would recommend in any case, that using screentones yourself make them all on a separate layer at least 1 separate layer because as soon as you merge your halftones with your art.	O
You're kind of stuff there and especially in this case here?	O
What if I want to get rid of the screen tone well.	O
Part of the issue is, you can't use your wand tool to select it because well first of all their individual.	O
And 2nd of all the same color as your line art.	O
So you can't just delete it.	O
So if you have it on a separate layer.	O
You can adjust it.	O
You can change.	O
You can scale.	O
It you can delete it.	O
However, you like without affecting your art and that's I think a pretty important thing.	O
You can't quite see here.	CHITCHAT
I use this particular template that I've made myself to do all my art for my comic book an I have a specific folder just for tones back here that I sometimes use.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes they get ahead of myself and just start stacking tones wherever but	CHITCHAT
Typically, I like to have a whole folder dedicated screentones.	CHITCHAT

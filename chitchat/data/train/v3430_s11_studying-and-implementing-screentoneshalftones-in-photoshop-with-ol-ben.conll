Some people go as far as labeling the screentones individually by their density and what their usages.	CHITCHAT
I've seen people do that to me.	CHITCHAT
That's too much.	CHITCHAT
It's too much too many files, too many layers not about that personally.	CHITCHAT
It's entirely up to you and what your workflow is though.	CHITCHAT
I often will just find myself stacking tones on random layers by accident.	CHITCHAT
And if I were to work, a little bit harder on my comic I would definitely make a point to separate them, so that's what I'd recommend now we're going to move on to some examples.	CHITCHAT
Of actual.	CHITCHAT
Real.	CHITCHAT
Screentones being used in manga and I'm going to use some of my examples.	O
When I talked about my I was doing.	CHITCHAT
Amongus study about a month ago, right around when I first started streaming on be hints.	CHITCHAT
We did a little deep dive.	CHITCHAT
And to manga mostly.	CHITCHAT
An mostly the line art actually but this time, we're going to take a little peek at as soon as I can find these.	O
Actual screentones implemented.	O
An manga.	O
So bear in mind.	CHITCHAT
For this series here that I'm going to be using there will likely be spoilers.	CHITCHAT
So if you have any interest at all, and not being spoiled on certain pages.	CHITCHAT
This is my warning to you OK.	CHITCHAT
Currently we're going to be looking at Demon Slayer.	O
Which is a pretty new anime Salada you probably haven't seen any of this stuff so bear in mind you may be spoiled OK, so taking a look at particularly this one lots of really cool screen tones here.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I have a hard time identifying when a manga is done digitally or when it's done traditionally like for this one for example, I can't imagine manually making these screentones or any of this art in general.	CHITCHAT
I just prefer to do to do digital personally.	CHITCHAT
It's just so convenient and clean.	CHITCHAT
But this I don't know this may or may not be done traditionally.	CHITCHAT
Uh but lots of manga artists today still manually do all their work and it blows me away.	O
They'll get physical screentones and cut them out and that blows my mind.	CHITCHAT
It's incredible manga.	CHITCHAT
Artists work, so ridiculously hard.	CHITCHAT
It blows my mind, but I think that in this case.	CHITCHAT
They've probably done a like a white paint over Top of their screen tone to give it a cool effect and a lot of times will actually physically scrape away that owns which are typically.	O
Overlaid on Top of their final art.	O
You get you get some general gradients here and again.	O
We have the problem of looking at scanned pages so not terribly clean, but you can see a little bit of like.	O
Conspicuous pattern there, it's a little bit weird isn't it, it's interesting, though.	O
But they'll typically used ringtones is just a way of well in some dramatic cases, though you've probably seen it on shows like?	O
Chowder, it was called had a very distinct art style, but they would have static textures that were revealed.	O
And they wouldn't move the textures wouldn't move they would just stay in one place and sometimes screen tones are used in a similar way, where they just put like you know if there's folds in clothing.	O
It doesn't matter.	O
Just put in the screen tone and let it happen.	O
And that's used a lot of the cases.	O
Here, like on the back of this guy's jacket and maybe even on this robe here.	O
I think that's just a static screen tone.	O
Overlaid on an area to save time more likely sometimes stylistically, but usually to save some time.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
But also just for filling in black spaces now I don't know.	O
I imagine having like manually mask off an area and painting with watercolors was not interrupt your actual line art would take more time than just cutting out a sheet.	O
Of Grey screen tone so that's probably the main reason why screen tones were so popular but I wonder personally.	O
I think the screen?	O
Don't look good stylistically.	O
I wouldn't prefer to use values.	O
I would prefer to use the screen tones myself but.	O
I just I wonder why they would prefer to do that.	CHITCHAT
Interesting.	CHITCHAT
Next up, we've got another page.	O
I don't know which of these might be a good example, though I'm just kind of like I'm literally just grabbing any page.	CHITCHAT
An it's an incredible example right away.	CHITCHAT
I think just every single page of any manga, I've read in a long time.	CHITCHAT
Just exceptional.	CHITCHAT
Use of screentones Here's a good example.	O
Now, one problem you get with making some kind of custom preset.	O

Screentones is that you're kind of limited for their usage and I'm looking at specifically the Top right grayscale screen tone here.	O
Well, OK, imagine you have like a sheet of A4 paper and it's got a diagonal gradient.	O
You can rotate that a bunch.	O
But you're kind of limited on your real estate.	O
You know you can't really just drop a whole screen tone here and I think that this is really fascinating how they've managed to get this to be such a natural gradient that actually moves.	O
Along with the direction of the roof here.	O
That's typically something you don't often get as far as I can tell so I think it's really interesting.	CHITCHAT
Furthermore, what's really interesting is that there's not a lot of screen tone going on here, which is a good example of crosshatching which maybe I should do a whole whole stream based on cross hatching, too because that's a big a big thing as well.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, you get a really dynamic shot here and you know looking at this.	O
In my File Explorer.	O
I thought it had a lot more going on than it did for screentones, but not a lot of this is just.	O
Manually placed hatches and values and it's impressive.	O
This must have some screen Tom into it, though like I can't imagine.	CHITCHAT
Wow, that was done otherwise.	CHITCHAT
I guess carefully.	CHITCHAT
Carefully must be the other answer.	CHITCHAT
Um we're going to move on to another manga.	O
This ones attack on Titan.	O
I talked about this quite a bit in a previous stream, but this ones are really cool usage sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Just adding that one flat screen tone over over a whole piece adds a huge level of depth.	O
And this is a great example.	O
Now, taking look at this tone here it seems to like have a weird organic edge to it and.	O
I will I will actually share.	O
A method doing that one thing that I've been really interested in recently are.	O
Dissolve brushes now I was trying to figure out what these were back when I was working on.	O
I think it was.	O
My my rock rock.	O
Town you guys remember that the Little Rock town that I made about 3 weeks ago.	CHITCHAT
Now I think I was looking for how to get those cool.	CHITCHAT
I don't know like well, I I can call him now to solved looking brushes and I recently discovered that is fantastic and they work really well as Screentones, too, so let me just drop in a quick quick I'll fill.	O
Just a really quick, I'll fill right here.	CHITCHAT
My brush a bit bigger.	O
I like this brush a lot it's a little bit more.	O
Visually interesting little circles in there, I like that.	O
A lot, So what you can do actually is just get really any brush.	O
I'm going to get a softer round brush.	O
Make it reasonably large, not too huge, though Annan said it to dissolve which it already is thanks to the call brushes and now you can just push why is it Oh yeah, it's been set back to the brush?	O
Let me pick a racer and then go up to here and now we've got Oh.	O
You can't actually do a dissolve with the eraser.	O
You have to do it with the brush.	O
But you can very gently get in some nice fills to your screen tones here.	O
Without interrupting 2, obviously the flow of the tone itself, so these tend to flow pretty nicely with the screen.	O
Tones normally but what you can do is actually flip it go from black to white and actually chip away at your screen tones, too, and that is super handy and now you can make your brush really small and tight.	O
You can find the edge of your screen tone like here for example.	O
Yeah, there's so crazy, it's fantastic.	CHITCHAT
I think it's looking at the actual like I recently went back to the first few chapters of attack on Titan and they're pretty rough.	CHITCHAT
But the screen tones were always pretty nice, yeah, we can just ship.	CHITCHAT
These these away a little bit here.	CHITCHAT
And it will make the edges of that owns a lot more natural because it is making like a radius of attack to the area around it even filling tone a little bit more probably back here too.	O
And you can also do flow.	O
I imagine it's probably not really not really a factor.	O

What about opacity is that?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the opacity works.	O
So you can change the opacity to change how densely comes in.	O
You get some nice nice effects out of that.	O
So if we had like a character's face.	O
OK, I'm gonna have to go back to my.	O
My typical method of looking at these brushes 'cause I can't I can't do this anymore.	CHITCHAT
Speaker.	CHITCHAT
Come on photo shop you can do it, I've moved back to not using my other PC because I wasn't doing the 360 panels and it still having hard time if that's OK.	CHITCHAT
So you can just have like a?	CHITCHAT
This is the face and say, We want to like bathe it and shadow.	O
Just like me, Casa on that reference page.	O
I'll start with just filling by safe Phil making a selection and I always expand.	O
My selection by 2.	O
I have a shortcut for it.	O
I've talked about it quite a bit.	O
It's basically just select modify expand by 2 because you do get even with the cow brushes quite a bit of Haloing unless you're using like a pencil you're always going to get.	O
This is using dissolves that's not really the case here, but you'll typically get like a small bit of like alias section.	O
That's Gray so I always just do a quick expansion.	O
Melons fill this.	O
Uh this is interesting this is a little bit more like A.	O
A crosshatch actually and this is the other direction, too, is this.	O
I think it is.	CHITCHAT
Here's the other direction, so we've actually got some some halftoning.	O
Some halftoning via cross hatching, which isn't really my plan.	O
Let me just don't do that, but that is interesting.	CHITCHAT
The Kyle brushes come with a diagonal like from Top left to bottom right and a Top right to bottom left brush so you can get some natural.	O
Natural consistent crosshatches another huge fan.	O
Personally, of of crosshatching like that, I prefer to do it manually but to each their own so now we just got this flat here this flat screen tone.	O
I'm going to go to softap round set dissolve set to white.	O
Just drop in some.	CHITCHAT
I'm just here and like an idiot.	CHITCHAT
I managed to make my screen tone attached my line art like I told you guys, literally just moments ago, not to do.	O
Are kind of stuck with that we can get that.	CHITCHAT
Just push these affluent.	O
And we get some you get some nice soft screentones there.	O
Just like going to exactly the same exactly the same as attack on Titan.	CHITCHAT
It's just fantastic, though it's really cool about this, though, is that it's 1 flat tone.	O
There's not overlap.	CHITCHAT
The only overlap you'll get is like in the blood here or in the mouth.	O
But that's not screen time.	CHITCHAT
That's all manually placed liner so the line art and the fills can work really well with the screen tones.	O
It typically work hand in hand in most cases.	O
And it really looks like there's just one tone applied to the entire page.	O
And so it looks like to Maine.	CHITCHAT
I think it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
I think the less you can use to make more of an affect the better as far as screentones go.	O
Another one we got here is similar situation.	O
This is an interesting, though I wonder how how these tones were overlaid because you have a street tone being used to give the look of.	O
Not just your hair better dresses well there's like a base value, which is this here.	O
And there's a second tone being applied over Top to give it that Shadow and I said earlier.	O
It's really difficult to do.	O
That, without getting the Moray but it's been accomplished.	O
I don't know how it was done.	CHITCHAT
But for the most part, there really is just um one tone being used other than that which is really cool.	O
It does give it a weirdly flat look.	O
Because if you were to come again so.	CHITCHAT

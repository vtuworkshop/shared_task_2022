Uh the screen tones are used to apply changes of value.	O
That's the whole point of the screen tone at its core So what that means is there has to be value in your mind to start with.	O
So if you look at this and think yourself.	CHITCHAT
While there's meant to be the Screentone.	O
What is meant to be 2 values there?	O
That makes everything a little bit less dynamic right all you really get is a highlight.	O
A Shadow and amid tone and until you really get to play with when you're using screentones like this specifically.	O
There is some screentone variation up here actually.	O
Let me stand corrected.	CHITCHAT
So it does make it look a little bit flatter, but I think it's as flat as it needs to be.	O
I think it achieves its goal.	O
Now this is a really interesting one bra zerk.	CHITCHAT
Is our next example?	CHITCHAT
And it's an example in the sense of not really being an example.	CHITCHAT
It's not quite true.	CHITCHAT
This guy back here is got some screentone usage as well.	O
That guy does 2 and 2 distinct screentones.	O
May I add or at least distinct in the sense of.	O
They don't look quite the same.	O
It's very possible.	CHITCHAT
That's the same screen tone just chipped away differently.	O
And there's a little bit on guts here as well, but otherwise.	CHITCHAT
Mirta does a lot of manual tone in the form of crosshatching it's insane.	O
I would imagine they use like?	CHITCHAT
He must have used like masking tape to get such a clean line here.	O
But something like that.	CHITCHAT
You can see, there's like elements of a physical line there, but I would definitely personally 100%.	CHITCHAT
Artificially screentone this sort there's no way I would manually make all those lines.	CHITCHAT
'cause that is ludicrous and this guy had takes him awhile to pump out a chapter and you know why looking at this.	CHITCHAT
It's absolutely Lucas.	CHITCHAT
It's insane.	CHITCHAT
Again, you might look at this link Oh that's the Screentone.	O
There, too, Nope well.	O
That's not true.	O
There is some screentone Here for sure.	O
On the rocks.	O
But it's mostly just cross hatching.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
An interesting example is actually the text gets all the screen tones, but nothing else, really does except there is a little bit of area back here that gets it, but It's just it's it's incredible here man Eric there.	O
We go look OK.	CHITCHAT
I was, I was a little bit too, quick to uh.	CHITCHAT
To say there's no screentones happening here, but, yeah, a very affectively very thoughtfully placed typically in my experience screen tones are used to work as a shortcut to get quick.	O
Visual interest without a whole lot of ever put in but it looks to me like berserk is full of screentones only when they serve their purpose.	O
I don't know how in the world, you would ever do.	CHITCHAT
Grayscale value like this manually.	CHITCHAT
Without using screentones I don't know how you would I just don't know like the cross hatching would just get so messy.	CHITCHAT
Just so quickly if you're to manually do that so.	CHITCHAT
Very incredible in my opinion.	CHITCHAT
I'll take a look at Dragon Ball.	O
Because Dragonball I think is going to be a really interesting example.	CHITCHAT
There, the ones to use screentones.	O
Very sparingly.	O
Typically, just for things like clothes never really shadows.	O
Because Dragonball doesn't really have very heavy shadows.	O
You'll typically find your fills only done when it's really necessary or like relevant.	O
Like Goku's hair for example.	O
A lot of especially like kind of like Nori Comics, like something you've probably seen Watchmen.	CHITCHAT
They use a lot of lot of those fat fills for shadows and then they taper those shadows out.	CHITCHAT
Dragon Ball doesn't really seem to be the kind of.	CHITCHAT
Kind of manga to do that.	CHITCHAT
But you will have probably seen what I'm talking about how he will just get like a really fat fill like?	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Well, I guess like this except like.	CHITCHAT
Less contextually.	CHITCHAT
Let's contextual than that.	CHITCHAT
But otherwise yeah, it just screen tones for flat values and that's about it really.	CHITCHAT
Like even all of this is patched.	CHITCHAT
It's just really interesting to me, so many different artists will approach their screen tones and so many different ways.	CHITCHAT

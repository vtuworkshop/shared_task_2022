Um.	CHITCHAT
And others will use them quite liberally this is from Vinland saga.	O
And here the whole background instead of showing like houses or environment.	O
They've limited just to just to screentones along with a little bit of cross hatching on the sides and this is much more exempt 3 of how I would personally use screentones just to kind of drop in some varied looks.	O
Without putting too much work in.	CHITCHAT
These what are what I would call Lazier Screentones, not to say that they're done effortlessly but there's a lot less thought.	CHITCHAT
I think to how they're implemented.	CHITCHAT
And they're a little bit more generic and broaden their usage too.	CHITCHAT
But you do get on this guys.	CHITCHAT
What is that I guess it's just like a little cloak?	CHITCHAT
Much more rougher texture looks a little bit like A.	CHITCHAT
Almost like a rocky texture in some ways.	CHITCHAT
But you get these sort of rough translations into one one to the next kind of like what I've done.	CHITCHAT
I've got 2 tones that have done something similar.	O
Got this one here.	O
Just making much rougher transitions from one to the next.	O
That's one thing I've done quite a bit and also this bumpy one this one is very bumpy.	CHITCHAT
A very bumpy screentone.	CHITCHAT
And those are really easy to do you just make a make some rough transitions from one to the next and then pop it into your bitmap adjustment and then there, you go you get your screen tones very simple.	O
And I do say um lazy, but it's very much oversimplifying it.	CHITCHAT
I would hardly say that Vinland sagas art is lazy, but it's more about the principle of the method of of how they're used little bit Lazier and nothing wrong with it just.	CHITCHAT
Just it's just that much quicker way of doing it, you know.	O
This is like an obvious example of?	CHITCHAT
The level of?	CHITCHAT
Of integrity of the artist here, you know.	CHITCHAT
All of this is probably manually patched in.	CHITCHAT
Just incredible.	CHITCHAT
And it's also a bit of an example of?	CHITCHAT
Just dropping in textures basically.	CHITCHAT
I would hesitate to say that this chain Mail is the screen tone, but it's very possible that they have done something like that, it would make total sense to me to turn like a chainmail texture into a screen tone and those are all things you can do you can make really anything into a screen tone like I said earlier.	O
Now I have been looking at ways of adding a halftone screen tone shader to blender.	O
But I have not quite gotten there yet, but that is something that I think would be interesting.	CHITCHAT
So that's a pretty rough example of just different types of usages for screen tones.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
I don't have any good example projects to work on.	CHITCHAT
Today.	CHITCHAT
As far as screen tons go, but maybe I'll do a few more examples.	CHITCHAT
I've got about 40 minutes left and we'll see what we can come up with along the way.	CHITCHAT
If any of you guys have questions so far, about like any of the methods that I've used up to now on how to actually get some screentones going on.	CHITCHAT
No means let me know.	CHITCHAT
Let's just see what we can come up with today so.	CHITCHAT
How about we make a chainmail screentone like I was talking about an that again so screen tones and patterns go along really well together.	O
Basically, a screen tone is just a pattern of like.	O
Dots.	O
Better just repeated of like you know different densities for the dots and everything.	O
So I'll just make a few while we're here.	O
Maybe some of these I'll actually have usage out of who knows?	CHITCHAT
But an interesting idea that kind of comes with Screentones is.	O
Go.	CHITCHAT
Is like the types of shape you used to compose your tones and most cases you'll use just circles just dots.	O
But you can also.	O

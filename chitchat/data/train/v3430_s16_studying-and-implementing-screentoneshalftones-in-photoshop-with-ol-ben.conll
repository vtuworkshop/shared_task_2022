Say make a And X, You can make an X you can make a diamond.	O
You can even make little hearts if you wanted to.	O
Earlier, I had said that what you could do is just make a little grid of dots.	O
But you could really get away with just the 1.2 and then you can change the density based on how far away.	O
The edges of your selection are to make your?	O
To make your pattern in the 1st place, let me give this a?	O
Let's make this even on all sides of 44 by 44, based on nothing.	O
I've based that number off of nothing at all.	CHITCHAT
It's entirely based on just what I felt like doing at the moment.	CHITCHAT
I'll make it roughly centered that's usually pretty ideal.	O
Centering your tones to make a nice and even.	O
So, there, we got a little heart pretty simple and straightforward.	O
And when I go to edit.	O
I'm going to go to pattern define pattern that is.	O
Call this.	O
Part tone brilliant.	O
OK.	O
Now just zoom out here.	O
Do the selection fill that and I'll choose the little heart there.	O
And there, you go you get some hard screentones very nice.	O
And if that's not quite.	CHITCHAT
Do you want it for you, you can?	CHITCHAT
Scale it down a little bit.	O
You can make your selection of its smaller.	O
Make like a 20 by 20?	O
How is that?	CHITCHAT
You get a much smaller tone that way.	O
And that's entirely based off of one object.	O
So it looks a bit.	O
Artificial this way.	O
If you have a few more if you can make like a solid like I think it 3.	O
By 3 at minimum, maybe like a six or a 5 by 5.	O
You can get a lot more variation in the actual dots.	O
That might make it look a little bit more organic.	O
I like to make my art look as organic as possible because.	CHITCHAT
I like to pretend that I've done more work than I actually have and I'm sure a lot of people like that same feeling as well.	CHITCHAT
I honestly feel like just the principle of using screentones digitally.	CHITCHAT
Is kind of trying to look like it's got more effort put in than it does at the root of it.	CHITCHAT
Obviously, there's the factor of like just kind of looking nice and that is the thing as well.	CHITCHAT
There is somebody on Deviantart, who has remember who it is, and I don't have their files.	CHITCHAT
But they actually have a whole bunch of like actual patterns that you can load into photo shop.	CHITCHAT
You would just go to like import patterns and then choose the one that they've had as a dot PST file.	CHITCHAT
But they've got a whole load of very specific screen tones of different like Densities and also.	CHITCHAT
Dot sizes, too, so how closely are and how big they are.	CHITCHAT
I don't have any of that.	CHITCHAT
But what I do have and I should have mentioned this way.	CHITCHAT
Earlier is there is an extension on the Adobe extension store.	O
Let me just bring this up real quick.	CHITCHAT
It's the exchange.	CHITCHAT
Rather, the Adobe exchange together.	O
We could take a peek and find it as a team, so you go to hear this is exchange.adobe.com click on creative cloud.	O
In this particular instance and here you can filter by your product.	O
You want to go to photo shop and we'll see how many pages down.	CHITCHAT
It is so it's not here.	CHITCHAT
It is on the first page.	O
Comic kit just open that up.	O
It's free very nice and this is a manga comic oriented extension that you can get.	O
And they do have screen tones that you can make in photo shop very quickly and very easily.	O
So now that I've got this already have this just download.	O
This added to your exchange.	O
Whatever you need too, and you'll be good to go.	CHITCHAT
And the way to use it.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know at first, but I know now how to use it what you can do.	CHITCHAT
Is one of two things really you can make a selection?	O
So say that you have some line art of like character and maybe he's got like a nice cup of tea here.	O

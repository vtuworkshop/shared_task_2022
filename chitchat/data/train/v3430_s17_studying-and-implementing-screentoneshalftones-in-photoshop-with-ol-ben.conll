This is literally just what's coming to mind.	CHITCHAT
Just having a little sympathy, perhaps and.	CHITCHAT
Go give him a nice like.	CHITCHAT
Line across is teacup here just having a little sip.	CHITCHAT
That's pretty good.	CHITCHAT
It's just an example.	CHITCHAT
Areas fantastic, he's got for whatever reason, he's got leather gloves on how does that sound?	CHITCHAT
He's got some leather gloves song for drinking dusty that's going to be a factor in just a second so we're going to do is we're going to make a selection of We want to fill.	O
And we want to fill this guys leather gloves in.	O
How's that sound you guys on board with that.	CHITCHAT
So we could do is go to shift F5 and once you've installed the.	O
The extension, you've added it to your exchange it should sync to your.	O
You know to your photo shop.	O
You can go to script.	O
Instructions.	O
For you guys as well if you want to.	CHITCHAT
And when you click on script you'll have.	O
OK.	O
Let me make sure though this might require yeah, you have to be on pattern first enable script and then select this drop down and you will find 4 new added scripts to your photo shop 2 of which are screen pattern screen pattern and speed lines.	O
One of 'em is English ones Japanese depending on your needs.	O
Choose whichever one works for you here.	CHITCHAT
We're going to choose screen pattern EX stand for English.	O
And then hit OK.	O
And it'll open up this window now.	O
My mouth is getting really dry.	CHITCHAT
Now this is a really tough tool to use.	O
And it took me a little while to really kind of get comfortable with it and I'm still not quite there yet.	CHITCHAT
But there's a couple of things to think about so the first of which is the preview zoom here at the bottom now.	O
This is a little bit vague.	O
I think that it's most accurate if you go to a very small.	O
Yeah, a tea sipping Bart.	CHITCHAT
I don't know that this is the accurate one or not, but typically it's either very smaller actual pixel will find out in just a second, but the size that this is will roughly represent what you're going to expect on your actual Phil.	O
But it will take some time to figure it out.	CHITCHAT
Now there are 2 major factors to consider when using this tool.	O
If you're going for just like a simple simple flat tone without any gradient to it at all.	O
You will have 2 literally.	CHITCHAT
Just the 2 things to think about and that is the pattern scale and the pixels per inch.	O
The pixels per inch is exactly how it sounds.	O
It's how many dots are going to be in A.	O
Well, an inch it's a little bit vague because what that inches is dependent on your file size for the most part your dimensions that you're working with.	O
But it will typically be that one by one.	O
And also the patterns scale so there is a flat scale.	O
You'll typically want to have your scale at like .2.	O
That's what I've tend to found to be pretty good, but depending on what you want to get you want to change that the smaller the scale is the more it is zero point number.	O
The lower that number is the smaller it will be the tighter your pixels will be so we scale is down.	O
Let me actually go to this is fine one to one you can see it's a very.	O
Small dots that aren't very close together.	O
Now, if we make the patterns per inch higher more patterns within an inch it will get.	O
Denser.	O
Right so you have to get this balancing act of size of your pixel.	O
Size of the scale in relation to how many there are in an inch so if the scale is bigger your dots will be larger.	O
And you will get a much closer to black image made of bigger circles, so if I make the scale here like .6.	O

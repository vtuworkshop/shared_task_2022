So you have to like click again.	O
It's just it's very awkward to use an it seems like the rotation happens based on nothing there's like no obvious.	O
No obvious.	CHITCHAT
Like bases that this uses for rotation roughly 0.	O
I guess you would think it would be straight up and down, but it's diagonal.	O
So you have to almost work in 90 degrees or 40 fives or fractions of 45, but say we moved to like 45.	O
We should expect vertical right at 45 years to expect vertical and see if that's the case.	O
It's not.	O
Or almost to 45 it rotated from the corner counterclockwise.	O
You would think that increasing from zero to 180.	O
Would be clockwise, but it's not?	O
We go to 0 is the same place so very awkward to figure out where you want to get your tone app and here we can do minus 45.	O
Is it just it all seems a little bit awkward and weird to use for me but of course the more you use it.	CHITCHAT
The more it'll be familiar and not so hard to figure out randomized patterns is pretty cool because you can get this too.	O
It'll like jitter stuff I think is the idea.	CHITCHAT
It'll it'll jitter the spacings of where the dots should be to where they're going to be, it's been cool textures out of that.	O
I'd say a little bit of randomization doesn't hurt.	CHITCHAT
And randomized size is a little bit dangerous.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I guess it seems like randomized size just means make some of them bigger and some of them not I don't think that's a very good randomizer, but that's fine.	O
Can only do so much with tools like that?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, you can randomize the size a little bit get some junk going.	O
Little bit chunk doesn't hurt.	CHITCHAT
Up.	O
And, of course, we have all these different types of.	O
All these different types of.	CHITCHAT
Gradients, which are handy insects.	O
I think is really cool have not had a good chance to use it yet, but it looks like a cool usage and of course, you've got the same tools to influence both of those.	CHITCHAT
You got like a nice little.	CHITCHAT
Plaid look as well.	CHITCHAT
I'll see how these look if you stack.	O
So we want to have like a drop shadow here go back to just to.	O
Normal.	O
Increase the pixels per inch the patterns per inch.	O
Select that.	O
Yeah, you get some weird like cells, having a cell party going on off the back of that which is a bit of a mess.	O
So there's our our little Bart Simpson, sipping some tea.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
And, of course, we can just use.	CHITCHAT
These are tones assault shadow as well.	O
It's a bit of a shame that I don't have any like good projects to work on revolving around this maybe what I'll do I don't like to work on my comic here on the hands, but maybe I'll do some do some pages on behaves.	CHITCHAT
This also.	CHITCHAT
It works alright.	CHITCHAT
So it's just a very rough example of a couple of Screentones and that's again using the comic kit, which is available on the Adobe exchange at exchange.adobe.com and you can also you know?	CHITCHAT
Why are there pick up the call brushes?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I will show you guys where to get those?	CHITCHAT
Let's together find out how to grab those guys were they at.	O
I think that you just click on it.	O
No.	O
How do you get the brushes?	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I just like search by Kyle brushes.	O
I have no idea.	CHITCHAT
There somewhere.	CHITCHAT
There's somewhere you can find him just just look it up.	CHITCHAT
Kyle brushes Adobe exchange.	O
They're all, free is fantastic.	O

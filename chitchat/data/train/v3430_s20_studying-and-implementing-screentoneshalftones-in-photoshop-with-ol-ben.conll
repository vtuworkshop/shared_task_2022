Are there any other projects any other ideas that I think should be talked about before he before you rap up for today.	CHITCHAT
I can't think of any right off the bat.	CHITCHAT
This was Done using a similar method to what I was using before where you convert your.	CHITCHAT
Your regular images.	CHITCHAT
Into halftone patterns.	CHITCHAT
Should I a deep dive into my really terrible?	CHITCHAT
Screentone comic work till I can do that, too also got this turtle here.	CHITCHAT
Which is using I think these are kind of blueish tones actually?	CHITCHAT
Yeah isn't it being kind of blue.	CHITCHAT
But just a general mixture using the screentone stylistically as opposed to practically.	CHITCHAT
Is that?	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll share with you all a brief example of some of the screen times, I've been using.	O
I think that this one was done.	O
Using the comic kids screen tones.	O
I just doesn't need an area for these did Phil and they went ahead and did the work for me.	O
Here you get a good example of the Moray that I so desperately want to avoid.	O
But I actually have exported this page.	O
I thought I did never mind.	CHITCHAT
Let me just go ahead and do that, and see how it looks so we go to image image size.	O
I'm going to actually need to blur.	O
This 1st and I think it might already be blurred.	O
Now let's just Blurt, a little bit.	O
Select that.	O
Which again will introduce a pretty dramatic level of grayscale value image size?	O
Drop this down to 24.	O
So the screentone itself has become basically.	O
Different levels of.	O
Of Grey, which isn't really ideal, but it does kind of give off the same look.	O
Without compromising too much of what I'd like to have.	O
And we just save that.	O
And we'll see upon.	CHITCHAT
Saving this, if it has got that more more A.	CHITCHAT
The more I look.	CHITCHAT
Here it is there shouldn't really be much, although maybe like here, you might see a bit of it.	CHITCHAT
You can see this is stop really becoming dots.	O
On the front of the turtle.	O
Let me take a peek.	CHITCHAT
I don't think there's any on the turtle but there may be.	O
No there are no screen tones on the turtle.	O
Those are all crosshatches.	O
Now I have had an issue where I'll look at my.	CHITCHAT
My screen tones in photo shop in the look just fine.	CHITCHAT
You do get a little bit of that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you guys can quite see but there's a little bit of Amore effect going on.	O
On the face here or if you're a little bit further out.	O
It looks a little bit different than it does when you zoom in a bit further, and that's exactly what I'm talking about so actually open this in my browser.	O
And you can see it's not too bad here.	CHITCHAT
That looks fine.	O
I typically find out looking at it in the browser is the best way to see if it looks OK.	O
Obviously, if you guys at home aren't making comics or anything for print like this, it won't be a problem at all.	CHITCHAT
They definitely get some weird effects going on with this guys hair specifically.	O
Or.	CHITCHAT
My earlier chapter think are much better example because I wasn't using very good techniques to make these screentones.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I think that this one looks rough on purpose that was the screentone I used intentionally.	O
To give up that look.	O
I can't move which of these specifically were so rough, though I think that these here might be a good example because these were very messy.	O

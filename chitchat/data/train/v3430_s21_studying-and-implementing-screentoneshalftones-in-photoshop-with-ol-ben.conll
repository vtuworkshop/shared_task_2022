Let's take a look here.	CHITCHAT
Not quite but these are still fairly rough.	CHITCHAT
Screentones, I'm not very proud of.	CHITCHAT
What ended up doing for a lot of these pages here?	CHITCHAT
Was I had just gone to fully painting everything in a uh.	O
In a grayscale wash.	O
And then converting it using the bitmap method and pasting it all back into my scene and it didn't look ideal to be completely honest in my opinion at least it's one of my bigger bigger drawbacks.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
Anyways I'm going to be wrapping up in about 15 minutes and 15 that is.	CHITCHAT
I think this is a good opportunity now to start looking at some other peoples art on Behance because typically get myself about 3 minutes to do that normally.	CHITCHAT
So spending some time, too.	CHITCHAT
Take a look at what people have on Behance, now get myself.	CHITCHAT
Some extra time is pretty nice.	CHITCHAT
And once I've done that will wrap up and I'll be back tomorrow, actually for another couple of hours and then on Sunday as well.	CHITCHAT
We're going to go for the full weekend full streams all throughout the weekend.	CHITCHAT
I've got a couple of things beforehand know Leslie followed my work.	CHITCHAT
As rough Oliver Ivan Julian.	CHITCHAT
And uh.	CHITCHAT
Well, that was 2 days ago.	CHITCHAT
Thank you to those 5 for a follow my work appreciate you.	CHITCHAT
OK let's take a peek.	CHITCHAT
Uh the The Discover Page hasn't been.	CHITCHAT
Changing 2 dramatically recently but this is looking like a pretty new batch of stuff to look at these are all featured things here all look we've got a From what I can tell.	CHITCHAT
Like I said look at there.	CHITCHAT
Some screentones Speaking of which huh?	CHITCHAT
How about that some good examples here.	CHITCHAT
This is work by.	CHITCHAT
Christoph.	CHITCHAT
Tastic.	CHITCHAT
These are really cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm really inspired by this kind of stuff I.	CHITCHAT
I have a hard time of coming up with good independent pieces like this.	CHITCHAT
A tiff file tiff files are usually pretty huge that's the thing tiff files are really good at like preserving details.	O
But not really too affective.	O
I think PNG is really slow are the way to go.	O
If you're talking about screentone stuff.	O
Still, I don't know what you're seeing right now.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, turtle if you have any specific questions.	CHITCHAT
You can just ask me on discord.	CHITCHAT
If you'd like to.	CHITCHAT
I can give you all the knowledge.	CHITCHAT
I know bearing in mind for very long amount of time I was saving all myself as Jpegs and it's not quite ideal.	O
I think I was doing that because like?	CHITCHAT
I think it was red bubble only accepts Jpegs I think.	O
So I had the impression that Jpegs were the way to go no they're not they're not great at all.	O
I think these are probably manually placed dots, but we do have some some screen to these are actually the halftones that people were talking about earlier or I guess I was talking about these earlier just pretty simple halftones.	O
This effect can be pretty easily achieved by just getting like a Gray and then converting it to 1/2 tone.	O
Those are super cool again that's Christoff Staras.	CHITCHAT
Super interesting I'm going to try to find exclusively screen and halftone work right now and studio build already has a couple in here.	CHITCHAT
Although the usage is a little bit less typical little less of what I've been sharing but that's kind of why I like it.	CHITCHAT
I like seeing implementations like this and what school is like.	O
Polka dots are kind of like halftones aren't they?	O
It's kind of the same idea.	O
Studio build their now lure Nicholas, who we can see right here.	CHITCHAT
I think yeah.	CHITCHAT
I I didn't seem at first, but I was thinking to myself that these look like the kinds of works that would really do good with some screentone action.	CHITCHAT
And right there, you got some looks great.	CHITCHAT
That's more of the Liechtenstein 1950s type of screentone usage as well that I talked a little bit about.	CHITCHAT
Very gentle usage, not every piece, I've seen has it.	CHITCHAT
In fact, just the one so far does but yeah, very gentle very mild usage.	CHITCHAT

I think works best.	CHITCHAT
For stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I think that if you want to use screentones.	CHITCHAT
If you want it to look like you're using them use them as gently as possible.	CHITCHAT
Or as aggressively as possible.	CHITCHAT
Don't really think you can middle the road it's so, so easily.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Not really finding any other examples right off the bat, though, which is not weird to Maine.	CHITCHAT
I think that it's very expected that screen tones.	CHITCHAT
Aren't that often used here's some more stuff by Christophe?	CHITCHAT
I really like his usage of of the halftones in screen time, like these are really great.	CHITCHAT
They're just uh just an interesting mixture of what's almost like a watercolor look.	CHITCHAT
With a very sharp.	CHITCHAT
Comic book look to it.	CHITCHAT
While adding in those screentones really honestly, I feel like these are a very modern Liechtenstein.	CHITCHAT
Implementation it's a very modern look.	CHITCHAT
Of what you'd expect.	CHITCHAT
The evolution to be, I think is the exact same stuff actually as might just be the exact same stuff.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, we also had am I talked a little bit about this person's work, a while back it's interesting how?	CHITCHAT
Consistent these themes can be.	CHITCHAT
This is a very uh.	CHITCHAT
Interesting usage as well, though it's almost.	CHITCHAT
They're almost used in a way that.	CHITCHAT
They're not even screentones anymore.	CHITCHAT
It's very weird.	CHITCHAT
All my cars are coming back by the way friends.	CHITCHAT
Not sure why are where from but they are nonetheless?	CHITCHAT
I do aim to work on my comic a little bit on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
Once I'm done here, so turtle.	CHITCHAT
You might want to come.	CHITCHAT
Check out what I got going over there.	CHITCHAT
I imagine Danny still going on so I don't want to.	CHITCHAT
Have to fight with him too much for for viewership.	CHITCHAT
Imagine that we share pretty much the exact same audience for the most Part 2.	CHITCHAT
I thought that we had, we were going to be able to see some screentones Here But.	CHITCHAT
Can't quite tell.	CHITCHAT
These are very.	CHITCHAT
Gently used screentones or thing.	CHITCHAT
The squash looking guy.	CHITCHAT
Looks like you might have some tone is going on in there, but it's really tough to see.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad that be Hans is slowly filling the void that pinchers left.	CHITCHAT
Pinterest Unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
Has become too difficult to find quality work on?	CHITCHAT
Point Alism and screentones share a very interesting space, I think that point, Alism.	O
Is?	CHITCHAT
Very distinctly different from screen tones.	O
While they are meant to do the same thing.	O
I think that the point.	CHITCHAT
Alism is much more intimate.	O
I think there's a much more personal.	O
You know age dot is put thoughtfully for the most part like oftentimes will just find yourself.	O
You know tapping dot cell just to get him out, but	O
They're much more thoughtful in their placement and a lot more personal too because the point of them dots usually you know.	O
Just just much bigger than a screen tone would be normally an the point.	O
Alism dots are there to be seen you know not not felt I guess it's a weird way of putting it but?	O
Thing is a super cool.	CHITCHAT
It's really great.	CHITCHAT
And you'll often get stuff like the Top of this horn for example, where you'll get really hard edges that taper out.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, all 3 screens.	CHITCHAT
Hope your desk is big enough.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Point is I think is a lot more difficult to use the screen tones to personally.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying my hand at some point, alism stuff just not very good at it, although to be fair.	CHITCHAT
I'm not all that great at Screentones, either so maybe that's just a me problem.	CHITCHAT
Very possible.	CHITCHAT
I want to look at all these other things, too, but I want to try to keep it contextual you know, but I like it quite a bit like all this stuff.	CHITCHAT
Having some jittery issues, though.	CHITCHAT
What's going on?	CHITCHAT
Adobe.	CHITCHAT
Help me out guys will just use the scroll bar.	CHITCHAT

I think that I saw.	CHITCHAT
I've seen this before.	CHITCHAT
This is a manga about rugby now.	CHITCHAT
This is an interesting use of tones.	CHITCHAT
These touch much more in my opinion into the realm of like uh.	O
Just standard illustrations using like dissolved brushes.	O
'Cause these don't really feel this feel grainy more than they do screentone which I think is really interesting because there can be overlap, there as well.	O
You can see, though, that there's like that circular pattern.	O
I'd used before on.	O
With the Kyle brushes, they have a similar pattern to this so that could be artificially done.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is a good look.	CHITCHAT
This is like a full on comic hanging on the hands page.	CHITCHAT
So you guys go take a peek at this.	CHITCHAT
This was from.	CHITCHAT
I just said his name didn't I.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's from ult it's Thomas Roofs, an Matthew Bertolet, so you can go check his out.	CHITCHAT
Oh here's some more modern.	CHITCHAT
Implementations of a more leakage time look as well.	CHITCHAT
See very pronounced large halftone patterns here.	CHITCHAT
Along with a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
Cross hatching to this ones by Van Orton design.	O
There's that for you.	CHITCHAT
Uhm yeah, some here as well fairly lithographic looking very cool.	O
Mostly Hatch, based but a little bit of that screen tones hanging out there.	O
That's actually pretty big theme for most of this so far, lots of cross hatching.	O
Little bit of halftones.	O
I think this is really cool, though it gives you some good examples and ideas of how you can maybe use screens in your own work, and this is interesting leave.	CHITCHAT
They've elected actually chop their screentones as opposed to let them just did it on their own, which to me.	CHITCHAT
I think is a bit too.	CHITCHAT
Bold of a move.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't like that as much.	CHITCHAT
I like to keep my screen tones whole.	O
I like I don't like to jump my tones if I can help it.	O
Yeah, but this is very pop party so this is another good example.	O
I think of more modern approach to the to the pop art.	O
Interesting how this what I would call a rim light is being transitioned into 1/2 tone as well, and it's really cool clever usage.	O
Also, interesting to use a uh.	CHITCHAT
A flat combined with the halftones as well, typically you get one or the other.	O
It looks like it's kind of done both here for this one.	O
Is just a couple of cutaways?	O
I suppose of how the illustrations looked flat?	O
Pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Anything else.	CHITCHAT
We'll see if we can get down there.	CHITCHAT
Oh, maybe I'll find some examples in here of what I was talking about earlier.	CHITCHAT
It just so choppy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, little bit of that's present here, notably on like the leg where you can see a bit of a like a halftone dissolved but it's not quite a halftone.	O
It's a weird Gray area between using a flat color as a screen tone, but also as a blender.	O
Yeah, like red knees legs here.	O
Or you'll have to color overlaps.	O
Let me just show you what I mean.	CHITCHAT
You'll have 2 colours basically say we have like?	O
A person.	O
Like this and say, We want to like fill that and we want to go with only the colours.	O
We don't want to have any liner.	O
Yeah, you like the buzz Lightyear One I like that one, too.	CHITCHAT
So you want to have like a?	O
Like a typical orange color here.	O
Tried that one and then have like a shadow.	O
And what we can do is get a brush I'll keep it.	O
Well actually go to like a proper brush here will make the size bigger it's it dissolve already.	O
Then we could just like.	O
Oh, that's what some change the spacing.	O
Brush tip shape spacing all the way down there, we go.	O
How to get rid of our jitters?	O

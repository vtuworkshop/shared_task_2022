And make sure the hardnesses all the way down to.	O
And then just delete all of that.	O
And you can get that really cool smooth.	O
Dillard transition, which does have some screentone elements to it, which I'm all about.	O
Just hide that select everything outside of the head here, I can delete that a little bit more cleanly.	O
That's what I was talking about earlier getting was nice, smooth, one color to the next transitions.	O
I'm going to lock.	O
The Opacity on this.	O
I'm going to push him fully is a little bit more.	O
Whoops.	CHITCHAT
Push and pull these a little bit more.	O
And I was wondering for a long time how to get this look and that's how you do it is this purple to you guys 'cause.	CHITCHAT
It looks like it's a bit more pink on my other monitor.	CHITCHAT
I hope that is not too pinkish.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to say that this display is wrong, and this ones right.	CHITCHAT
This one is the correct one.	CHITCHAT
I've got to assume yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's how you get those cool transitions and of course, if you.	CHITCHAT
If you blur it a little bit too.	O
Just get a little bit of a blur going on.	O
That will smooth out those those colors, a little bit more so than us so sharp.	O
So it's a little hard to look at, I don't know how other people do it, but I think that's a totally valid valid route date for that.	CHITCHAT
OK, well that's it for me today.	CHITCHAT
That's it for me on Behance today go back tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
With maybe somewhere Screentone Studies, not really sure just yet.	CHITCHAT
But I like to come up with some cool ideas, maybe even delving into this artstyle little bit more this specific type of like.	CHITCHAT
I want to say like Kurtz, Kasak, but I know they've never actually used this look, but I feel like their artstyle kind of.	CHITCHAT
Is cohesive with this with this illustration type look but this is a look?	CHITCHAT
I wanted to get for quite a while.	CHITCHAT
At least implement when I know when I want to, but I never really learned what it was exactly what the process was so now that I know that I might do some more of this kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Possibly tomorrow, not really sure yet otherwise, though everybody thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Gotta appreciate y'all.	CHITCHAT
Let me just make one more check to see if I have any more people to think.	CHITCHAT
We have one person.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately, I can't pronounce that but thank you nonetheless.	CHITCHAT
You know who you are?	CHITCHAT
How was that yeah, I'll be back again tomorrow?	CHITCHAT
Don't really know when exactly it's going to be a bit of a weird day for me tomorrow and the next day.	CHITCHAT
But I will be on then and yeah, thanks for hanging out hopefully this was relatively educational.	CHITCHAT
I might do a recap tomorrow of basically everything we went over maybe get some more specific illustrations to work on and then put the screen tones with, but yeah, that's all we got let me do this.	CHITCHAT
Oh hold on what do you guys think of this?	CHITCHAT
Will make it really awkward?	CHITCHAT
It doesn't want to do it.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
OK, I wanted to transition very slowly, but it refused so.	CHITCHAT
Now let's go back to this, yeah again by everybody.	CHITCHAT

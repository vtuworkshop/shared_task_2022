You're missing out so you need to come on with it with it.	CHITCHAT
Let me see if I can now.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Still, not showing up wine at Camera.	CHITCHAT
Oma.	CHITCHAT
I don't see it OK, so download Adobe fresco is free.	O
There's some things in there that you're going to like me personally, I'm all about the vector and the reason I like vector brushes because you can export it to illustrator as a PDF whatever file you working on export as a PDF open into illustrator boom vectors.	O
You can see all your anchor points.	O
You can see all your paths and handles everything all of that is good to go.	O
It's awesome.	CHITCHAT
It's amazing.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Alright so if you guys can hear me in Simi.	CHITCHAT
That's cool if it sounds a little weird.	CHITCHAT
Please let me know 'cause I cannot monitor for some reason all right there, we go.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna keep on rolling keep on rolling Alright.	CHITCHAT
So here we go, we got my sketch, which I could have done in Adobe fresco.	O
But I really like the feel of Sketchable is so and I like going live.	CHITCHAT
And showing off my process so I'll jump on Frisco or sketchable.	CHITCHAT
Fresco is available on the iPad and the surface, but Sketchable is only for Windows 10.	O
So here we go turn down the opacity when it comes to my sketch go ahead and select the layer where I'm going to start my drawing.	O
I have my vector brushes selected all right.	O
It is the basic round.	O
I like that brush and I like that.	O
It supports on pressure, however, with this drawing.	O
I don't want any thicker thin lines any variation in the lines.	O
I just want a solid.	O
Line the stays consistent throughout my drawing so I'm going to see if you can see that now my face on the way so let me go ahead put this over here.	O
Pressure dynamics i'mma turn that off and what happens is that now is not doesn't.	O
The line does not change in with.	O
An it doesn't respond to the pressure that I'm putting on my pin, which is good.	O
That's what I want I mean, it's up to you to choose what you want?	CHITCHAT
How you want it and let me see what that shows that shows angle roundness and so on, but now I'm going to go ahead and there's a smoothing.	O
I never paid attention to their smoothing.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if it really gets a little.	CHITCHAT
Jagged and you're so on.	CHITCHAT
When mine.	CHITCHAT
When I'm drawing alright so let's get that 8 take it down to 2, 1/2 and test out the drawing.	O
I'm going to put away the layers by clicking on the layers icon and then let's see let's see what happens.	O
Well, that's OK.	O
I like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make sure that it looks like a drawing that's what I want.	O
And that means that I wanted to have not to be super perfect.	O
I don't want it to be perfect.	CHITCHAT
I don't want the lines to be super perfect.	O
If I want to super straight lines and I would use Adobe illustrator front when it comes to the vector lines, there, it is very cool look at that.	O
And I'm telling you we're gonna sit here and work on this tonight.	CHITCHAT
And when I say we I mean, I mean me.	CHITCHAT
But we're gonna work on this annual see how.	CHITCHAT

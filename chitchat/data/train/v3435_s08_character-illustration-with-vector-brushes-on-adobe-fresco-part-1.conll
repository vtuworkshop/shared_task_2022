And then that hand is OK, yeah, yeah, yeah.	O
Huh.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the fingers feel little far.	O
Both hands.	O
I'm good with that.	CHITCHAT
I may need to rework the hands.	O
Not against it.	O
So matter fact, Oh I got the fingers.	O
Separate or look at that I did good.	O
Come on.	CHITCHAT
I was glad I did that, then I can just go like this.	O
And I can bring that down you see that.	O
That's why we work in layers.	O
I did not pay attention that I did that.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad I did do that.	CHITCHAT
Did I do that that?	CHITCHAT
All right now, the hand.	O
The other hand.	O
So that was good this one needs work.	O
It's a matter of fact when I'm going to do just going to turn down their opacity.	O
Give me another layer.	O
And try it again.	O
'Cause I can do better.	O
So let's go.	O
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
One of them now.	O
So this one is to be lower.	O
And see like sometimes you gotta remember how the flow your knuckles and your fingers.	O
How they fit together so that you can get the most realistic looking hands possible?	O
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
Dance.	CHITCHAT
And then this girl he ran out there, it is go.	CHITCHAT
Let's go on like this.	O
This.	O
Huh.	CHITCHAT
The same with the Mustang.	O
A little better.	O
Not perfect, but better.	O
Let's do it again but still.	O
This turn off this hand, so that we don't have that problem.	O
And they go back here.	O
And then go right there.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright alright.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
No let me down here.	O
No.	O
Skype.	CHITCHAT
Little bigger and then these definitely smaller.	O
There.	O
I like that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let me know what you think is it OK.	CHITCHAT
Yahoo.	CHITCHAT
Put that there.	O
This here and now I can follow my design.	O
There it is.	O
We had same.	O
Same look.	O
System and see.	O
Alright very good, I got it so let's go with that and now I can adjust the pen.	O
Get the eraser an look I can just erase the parse.	O
They need to be gone.	O
I could leave it.	O
And then what I end up doing is adding the color between the layers so some of these lines are.	O
Covered up.	O
But a lot of Times, some that's extra work.	O
Because now you have to make sure that one layers exactly on Top of the other layer an if it overlaps in more than one way, meaning that this one layer should go under initiative to go over depending on the part that you're looking at and.	O
Yeah becomes too much of a hassle so it's easier to just do this.	O
Don't do what you think is right, what works for you.	O
As a matter of Factly me, I'm still right here.	CHITCHAT
This is gone all the way out.	O
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
There it goes, and I need to fix that.	O

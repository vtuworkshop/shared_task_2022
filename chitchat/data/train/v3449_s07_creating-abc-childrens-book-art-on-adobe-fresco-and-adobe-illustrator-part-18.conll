OK.	CHITCHAT
So some of you guys may be able to see it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if I can see it.	CHITCHAT
Let me double check It looks like it's there, OK, so something happened to it here.	CHITCHAT
Let me close out a few things.	CHITCHAT
Mama I don't know what happened on that side, so let's go ahead and get back to it OK.	CHITCHAT
We're back.	CHITCHAT
We're back.	CHITCHAT
Yes, OK Alright If you can see me if you can hear me say something say something.	CHITCHAT
Please say something, I'm on be Hans.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, sometimes sometimes things don't want to work the way you tell him too.	CHITCHAT
Right there, it looks like it's still working, so when the key role in OK.	CHITCHAT
We're back so as I was saying.	CHITCHAT
I worked on this and uh Adobe fresco every time you finish a letter.	O
I like to export every time I finish a letter.	O
I go back to the home.	O
The House, the little house on the side.	CHITCHAT
I click on that, so that I can then make sure it saves and there.	O
There goes there was a little cloud on the Top right and it spins the little sink spin so that then you can.	O
It saves up to the cloud.	O
So now let me double check that what we got going on here live there, it is says live?	O
I just wanna see that we have a video.	CHITCHAT
It shows a video over there is not showing the video anywhere else.	CHITCHAT
And that's OK as long as you guys can see it, then we get to go.	CHITCHAT
So now that I have saved this uhm with the creative cloud now go ahead and export also but sometimes I export first just in case the creative cloud export doesn't work.	O
So we're not going to worry about the time LAX export fields.	CHITCHAT
We just saw what happened.	CHITCHAT
Almost last this whole string.	CHITCHAT
Uh because it's so took the drawing took so long.	CHITCHAT
It's along video for the time last very long and uh it.	CHITCHAT
Only records the strokes and not real time video.	CHITCHAT
But just to wreck the strokes and so then there's a lot of lines in this drawing so that's what happened.	CHITCHAT
So now we're going to click on export as and I'm going to call this ABC.	O
Umo vector vector brushes.	O
It vector lines, there, it is I said, and the format is going to be PDF.	O
It's important that we do PDF here.	O
It's important that we do PDF because that's what's gonna uh keep all those vector lines alive so now we export.	O
There it is I have a a 2019 folder with ABC books.	CHITCHAT
'cause I got several books that I'm working on that.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to work on fresco files.	O

Cool, cool, OK, So what do we do now?	CHITCHAT
Now comes the fun part is kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'll let me clean up.	O
I gotta clean up.	O
These layers alright, so uh.	O
Let's open our layers to see what we got.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Bethany for following my work I need to turn this turn of- uh.	CHITCHAT
This is goodbye alright so thank you.	CHITCHAT
Sue Young Alright.	CHITCHAT
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
These are all the layers.	O
And I think I know what happened with the be with the letter.	CHITCHAT
BI did something that's why it looks so little alright, so what's happening is that whenever you create a layer in some artwork with Adobe fresco and this happened, not didn't happen.	O
I don't remember it happening with Adobe trial is that it creates this other artifact of a layer that is really not necessary for it to live there.	O
So here's an example there.	O
It goes right there right so that's got rid of that let me.	O
And now we have is the vector lines this is my signature.	O
Make doing the layer.	O
Go here.	O
Signature.	O
That's my DTS danger, you layer lock it.	O
And let me do a bunch of layers, cool, cool, cool the letter Z put it there.	O
This is gonna be page.	O
Z see that.	O
Page DTM saved.	O
Start cleaning up your layers organizing.	O
Organizing getting rid of this clipping path that I don't understand what it's for.	O
But this whole long Z layer there, it is, isn't that letter.	O
C.	O
So that group right lock it.	O
Next, the why.	CHITCHAT
Click on that get rid of it.	O
And let me do that to other letters.	O
1st and then I'll start organizing it too late into uh.	O
Layers.	O
So that I can have them on a different page.	O
An I gotta create pages.	O
So how do we create pages well?	CHITCHAT
We're gonna do?	CHITCHAT

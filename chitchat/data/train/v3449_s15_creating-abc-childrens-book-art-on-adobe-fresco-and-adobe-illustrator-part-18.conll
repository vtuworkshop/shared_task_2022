What's happening is?	CHITCHAT
OK, so coloring pages kind of bland right.	O
It was very cool looking it's got all this, some these shapes and things.	O
But now you look at it like uh?	CHITCHAT
What's the fun here, so let's grab.	CHITCHAT
This group, which is the A and then I'm going to make a copy click, and drag there.	O
It is a new way so let's lock that, a grab this other A?	O
Turn down the Opacity.	O
To like A6 sex or whatever 14 cool cuckoo hold down the shift bone look.	O
Various.	O
So now you get a little bit of more action on the page and so it be nice if.	O
Just go right there.	O
Haha Annona I know what to do as a matter of fact.	CHITCHAT
Now I think that's that's good that's good.	CHITCHAT
There it is now this side is not gonna have anything an I'm OK if some of the letter.	O
Um sticks out outside the page 'cause when it's time to export you're not going to see that it's gonna.	O
It's not gonna get exported.	O
However, there's a part right there.	O
That's gonna be a problem because it's gonna show up on the other.	O
Page, where it doesn't belong then I can click and drag right here.	O
The elites boom there, it is.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, let's go right, there delete boom look at that.	O
I understood that delete now we need to clean up, um inside of this letter because I don't want this uh.	O
Other other letter in the background to come through where we're going to color in so the best way to handle that is to click, and drag inside with the direct selection tool and then hit delete.	O
One delete on one delete only need to do one day at a time late.	O
Yep, there, we go.	O
Delete that.	O
Yes, it.	O
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I guess I could make the letter, A with my pen tool.	O
May I guess I could do that.	O
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry illustrator purists.	CHITCHAT
I do what I need to do to get the job done.	CHITCHAT
And it takes a combination of different things and sometimes you know you go for what you prefer.	CHITCHAT
Drawl about the pencil Dan.	CHITCHAT
And that's how I am when I teach then of course I will use the pencil.	CHITCHAT
Then it's probably going to be a better option since uh.	CHITCHAT
It's faster.	CHITCHAT
I mean as many clicks in click, and drag them that I'm doing right now, I probably would be done.	CHITCHAT
If I was doing it with a pencil.	CHITCHAT
How many clicks and drags do you need to make the letter A?	CHITCHAT
And I'll tell you what once I get the print version of this book.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna look at it and be like man?	CHITCHAT
What was I thinking?	CHITCHAT
And then it's gonna be some edits and changes that need to happen.	CHITCHAT
So those of you who are going to get a free copy of this uhm.	CHITCHAT
Is there some things that could be better and I know that once my wife looks at it?	CHITCHAT
She's gonna spend a lot of things that could be better.	CHITCHAT
There it is dumb so we got the letter egg inside the page for the background.	O
We have another copy of the letter, A but with the opacity really turned down and it probably that's good enough maybe make it darker.	O
There.	O
Done of course I see more pieces that could be better enemy drop my.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
My chair chair.	CHITCHAT
Look at that so matter fact I could have grabbed the eraser.	O
And just erasing things.	O
Go ahead.	O
Control a bone look at that.	O
You see that I mean, there's a lot of different solutions for the same thing.	O

Another layer of course I'm drawing another letter, A?	O
How many letter asses you need however many it takes?	CHITCHAT
That's how many.	CHITCHAT
Don't.	CHITCHAT
Are you dumb?	CHITCHAT
I brush allows you to.	O
Um draw on the screen kind of like a vector brushes on fresco.	O
You draw on the screen, except that it becomes a shape.	O
The other brush the paintbrush makes gives you.	O
Pass.	O
This one gives you a shape there, it is.	O
Yeah, yes, cool down there.	O
Yes yes yes.	CHITCHAT
I like it control minus central minus and now we have that page.	O
I like it.	CHITCHAT
I like it, I like it.	CHITCHAT
Let me know what you think was this method better was the other one better who know.	CHITCHAT
Who knows since you respond as a matter of fact now?	CHITCHAT
I can actually fix this right get the eraser?	O
And then go here, I must now I can see.	O
The background.	O
See that.	CHITCHAT
Cool, back to the one of my arrows and look at that so now when I move.	O
These 2 layers.	O
This is gonna be letter, A white.	O
If I need to move and this the letter, A layer.	O
I can grab the letter, A white with it.	O
And so when I shift and move the letter, A back is I will not have to adjust that at all.	O
'cause I only the parse that the letter, A white is covering are not gonna show so even no matter where I move that letter, a white layer it.	O
Will it will block the letter, A back?	O
Does that make sense?	CHITCHAT
I don't know it kinda is a whole?	CHITCHAT
I got lost in a whole bunch of letter 8 things.	CHITCHAT
But their letter 8 gun control S OK, so about saving you constantly have to say you have to save all the time.	O
There it is it takes a few minutes, a few seconds.	CHITCHAT
Uh sometimes you gotta go get your son to drink.	CHITCHAT
But there it is OK cool.	CHITCHAT
Now let's it.	CHITCHAT
But you have to say you don't don't work for an hour and then think that everything is gonna be OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm not done with the letter, a hold on.	O
So now here.	O
Uh let's do another layer.	O
Oh, I got tons of layers up here piling on bone.	O
This is gonna be in left Page left side areas go here.	O
Van and go there, so why I'm doing that is uh.	O
Yeah, so that I can cover the parts that I don't want.	O
So does it go outside the page yet, but who cares doesn't matter 'cause.	O
It is not gonna uh.	CHITCHAT
It's not gonna end up in the file anyways.	O
But just so that we can keep a clean looking.	O
Um document let's do that, so that's the left side, so the left side will include whatever I want to have for the letter X?	O
OK later a page a done.	O
Save.	O
Unlock the be all wait a minute you still saving.	O
Scott to say.	CHITCHAT
Done.	O
There you go letter P?	O
What are we gonna do the same thing see.	O
Now that I figured out a way to layout this pages these letters now.	O
I just follow my process and I roll right through roll right through it.	O
I did forget what my percentage was, I think it was uh a 19%.	O
And I need to make sure that I kinda keep a consistency and the size which I'm not apparently.	O
I am not.	CHITCHAT
I can tell so let's bring it there.	O
Yeah, yeah, this size is much bigger.	O
This Phone.	O
And I'm looking at my bleed I'm gonna be missing that corner on the blade.	O
As OK.	O
Messi bring it over.	O

It's an order blank pages, yeah, blanket inside back back cover.	O
There it is.	O
We exported to PDF now you can use this file.	O
Let me close this uh.	O
Illustrator frog because it's heavy.	O
So a lot of pages.	O
We have exported as a PDF from a close illustrator.	O
I have my files right here.	O
They're not going anywhere.	CHITCHAT
No need to be scared.	CHITCHAT
And if I were to open this PDF out.	O
I think I could still grab the vector layers and so on.	O
I don't care 'cause I do have the illustrator file.	O
There it is the book layout that's The One I was working I was working on.	O
There it is book layout aren't life book layout.	CHITCHAT
Yes, yes, I know I know high CPU.	CHITCHAT
Alright so in any case.	CHITCHAT
Oh let's do the close up shot boom so you guys can see me.	CHITCHAT
Let me uh.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah that microphone is working right there.	CHITCHAT
Let me tell you, it's uh.	CHITCHAT
It's been a High Road right.	CHITCHAT
It's been tough to make sure that a number one.	O
I worked through the sketches to get the shapes too.	O
I can look at the letters and no that's what I want.	O
But until I see the letters and I sketch him.	O
I won't know that's what I want which is why we have to start you have to start the project and just get out and waited and see what happens.	O
Then, at another I have the letter shapes.	O
I start working with the composition and a little bit of detail and that's all still sketching there's no pencils.	O
So I did the sketching in the detail to see whether or not I want to make adjustments to those shapes and which markers which pencils combination and flow balance.	O
You know all those things that make graphic design fundamentals and elements work for your.	O
Images and illustrations and uh so then.	O
After that boom vector brushes.	O
Vector brushes vector brushes.	CHITCHAT
All man you.	CHITCHAT
See you see you see the videos that I'm be hands.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of them answers.	CHITCHAT
A lot of vector brushes.	CHITCHAT
A lot of vector brushes, drawing drawing drawing drawing with vector brushes.	CHITCHAT
Not that there's more than one vector brush.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm just drawing with the vector brush right so there's a lot of videos with vector brushes.	CHITCHAT
Then, after that is uhm now, what we're working on illustrator.	O
You saw me working 5 pages.	O
It was tedious.	CHITCHAT
I have, I messed up the first page.	O
A That's 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I kind of had an idea?	CHITCHAT
what I wanted to do then wasn't working for me, it felt like come.	CHITCHAT
It was gonna have to delete delete.	O
Delete too much when it's easier to just make that shape and I'm block out a part of that background.	O
So 1 sided that you saw how easy to get it is to get into that flow.	O
ABC DE but after that is making sure that I have the full book laid out and uh in in a way where it allows me to see the composition on my pages so that I have the multiples of 4, which is how you make a book get a book published.	O
It has to be multiples of 4 and I think that come at the 16 it was not enough.	O
Pages.	O
At the end of the letter Z to the end of the book I needed a couple extra cushion.	O
I know I could add extra things in there and I think I will gonna definitely put my bio or drawing on myself, um and so on.	O
But those are the those are the steps that I just showed you that it takes when working on a project like this, where you know that is, is going to end up as a product somewhere.	CHITCHAT
We start our creativity, we started creative process we start our.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Creative exploration for the fun of it.	CHITCHAT

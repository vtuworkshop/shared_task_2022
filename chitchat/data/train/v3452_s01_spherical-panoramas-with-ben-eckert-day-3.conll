Like very gradually taking its footsteps into the like you know common common usage domain you've got.	CHITCHAT
Valve releasing their half-life Alex game, which is probably the biggest endorsement for VR that there's been yet and the more we get into the space the more you're going to need concept art.	CHITCHAT
You're going to have people who can develop virtual environments quickly easily to get ideas across for presentations for concept art for actual development all kinds of things like that.	CHITCHAT
I think that this can have value.	CHITCHAT
And not just that, but also on the consumer side, having people more often using things like the rifts in the quests and the other VR tools.	CHITCHAT
I mean, you can even do VR on your phone and open that up and multiple VR programs.	CHITCHAT
It's more like I guess I don't know if you call it VR necessarily but it's becoming a lot more widespread and I think being able to.	CHITCHAT
Do something like this in Photoshop, which is so easily accessible and just doing it right in your typical work environment is super cool.	CHITCHAT
So I'm more and more falling in love with doing these spherical panoramas.	CHITCHAT
And while they might not be the most like technically useful.	CHITCHAT
Uh illustrations, you can't really quickly, import a scene like this into a VR space like in blender or in my like you can't.	CHITCHAT
You can't really use this for modeling.	CHITCHAT
It's much more like just your standard concept art that you'd see for a game pitch or anything like that, really just in a pseudo VR environment, so that's I think got a lot of value to it.	CHITCHAT
And with all That being said.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm ready to get to painting so there were a lot of bumps in the roads up to this point on the first day we ended up getting something made but it was just such a a choppy awkward experience, I didn't really have a good workflow.	CHITCHAT
We were just discovering it.	CHITCHAT
It was a slow learning procedure for.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully both you and me.	CHITCHAT
Day 2, I had some research I knew what I wanted to do I knew how to do it, but the actual like execution of that was pretty bumpy.	CHITCHAT
We had a few crashes.	CHITCHAT
Some hardware problems as well as seemed like my computer just isn't.	CHITCHAT
It's not a bad PC, but it's not quite up to doing like large resolution fully VR things on its own and streaming.	CHITCHAT
So now I've got the second workhorse PC to do the streaming and coding for me, I've got my primary PC here for just the one task.	CHITCHAT
It's got one goal in his mind and that's to make a panoramic photo sphere.	O
And I think it will workout I think it'll workout alright today and in fairness.	CHITCHAT
I already did the sketch and the hardest part is doing.	O
The sketch because of the latency because of the intensity of the simulation of the textures in the sphere.	O
So now if we just do a painting it should be pretty straightforward like from this point on it should basically just be any other painting and photo shop just in the fact that it's.	O
Kind of weirdly distorted right that's the one thing about this so.	O
We're going to play around with the offset we're going to play around with getting some nice textures, and paintings going on here.	O
I'll talk a little bit about the inspiration for this particular piece here.	CHITCHAT
I kind of had in my mind.	CHITCHAT
Imagine you're in some sort of like not really a ship, but like a small floating platform that's got like like like a boat like a motorboat except in the Sky and surrounding you are all these rich pink yellow clouds very fluffy very.	CHITCHAT
Warm and comfortable alongside these whales that are flying above Yuan.	CHITCHAT
It's a very fantasy environment and I think it's going to be.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be tough to do, but I think it'll be fun, as well.	CHITCHAT
and I think what I'm going to also do is up to this point, I hadn't really tightened up my line art.	O
I think I have a lot of opportunities here to make the line art a lot sharper and cleaner and overall a lot better.	O
I'm going to try to really get a good presentation here and that's going to be my focus making sure that it.	CHITCHAT
Looks good.	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to make sure that it feels good in the VR space.	O
An I think in general.	CHITCHAT
You should probably flip those priorities.	CHITCHAT
You should make it feel comfortable first.	CHITCHAT
But I think it'll feel comfortable anyways so.	CHITCHAT
If I can make the painting itself look nice.	CHITCHAT
I have high high hopes for how this is going to turn out so this will be my second attempt at a properly nice looking photo sphere illustration.	CHITCHAT

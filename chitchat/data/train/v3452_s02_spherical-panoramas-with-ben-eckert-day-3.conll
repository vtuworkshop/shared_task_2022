So again we've got about 2 hours today to work on this.	CHITCHAT
I can go over if I really feel like I need to put the extra time in but I think will be OK with just 2 hours for this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start out with.	O
I think I'm going to focus on the colours 1st and then I can add my tightened up line art after that.	O
We've still got the Christmas lights up to celebrate our December.	CHITCHAT
The ending of our December and then maybe I'll get some cool firework effects for new year.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have a pretty busy January.	CHITCHAT
So I might not be able to put too much time into making that look spiffy, but I think it'll be alright so with That being said.	CHITCHAT
Let's just go ahead and start blocking in some colors.	O
I'm going to keep actually the first thing I want to do this is the first thing I like to do in every painting now that I've learned that is important is to get rid of all the white all the white is actually an Alpha.	O
It's not transparent.	O
I could set my line art to multiply that is an option, but I think it's just.	O
Much more simple to just get rid of all the white.	O
So pretty quick and easy Oh yeah, now that we have a project open.	CHITCHAT
I can enable the tool timeline so those of you at home, watching the video after can keep up.	CHITCHAT
You can see what I'm using my tools should be pretty simple pretty straightforward.	CHITCHAT
But there are a couple of tricks that I like to use that might not be entirely obvious.	CHITCHAT
So again, yeah, we've got our nice guy with the whales.	O
It looks pretty good in the VR environment.	O
There is one problem, though, is that maybe up towards the Top.	O
I have a whale above the viewer so that might get a little bit weird looking but I can fix whatever I need to in the photo sphere itself, so again select color range.	O
We're just going to select the white.	O
And then press OK.	O
And then I like to use a action that I made I might even do a video a stream, about actions.	CHITCHAT
Lots of people have done them and they've done better than I have.	CHITCHAT
But you know if you guys want to see what my opinion is on him.	CHITCHAT
I'll be happy to do that.	CHITCHAT
But my action here is set to F-10 and that is set to expand my selection by 2 pixels, which is generally pretty good.	O
But in this case, maybe a little bit too much so I'll just do that a couple of times.	O
And then maybe just do a select modify expand by one.	O
And that's a much cleaner much cleaner cut out.	O
And there are a couple of options here again.	O
We can just do multiply and put that above everything and now if I paint back here it should.	O
Let my colors through as they are there shouldn't be any variation to the actual color?	O
Some blending modes you'll have that issue where like overlay for example, if we pay here it won't be the exact.	O
The exact read that I initially put down.	O
So multiply is pretty good for that white basically does nothing to your to your colors.	O
But as the as the values get darker.	O
It begins to affect that and you can see that effect happening with like these Gray lines in the black lines so for the most part will be able to keep our wow.	O
Are colors just how we want to?	CHITCHAT
I think I want to start with just a nice a nice of wash too.	O
To get us some?	O
Get us some base colors in.	O
When is my trusty watercolor brush and just start pushing around some nice nice pinkish Sun City colors all around?	O
That'll be pretty fun.	CHITCHAT
It feels a little bit dishonest to call this a spirit Panorama stream when really it's just a normal painting stream.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
What it does and the going into is pretty important?	CHITCHAT
The way I'm actually doing all this is pretty much critical to how the end result will look in the photo sphere.	CHITCHAT
So maybe it's not too dishonest, but	CHITCHAT
People might show up thinking to themselves Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
Let's figure out how these panoramic photo spheres.	CHITCHAT
Look and let me see.	CHITCHAT
I'm just painting.	CHITCHAT
So I feel like there's a burden that I have to carry to make this look as a engaging and interesting as possible so.	CHITCHAT
That's what my job is.	CHITCHAT
It's important to remember the distortion when you're painting, these an my base line art has done a good job of helping me know how the shape should work I did draw it all in the photo sphere itself, so it should have.	O
Its natural expected distortions based on the closeness and furnace from the Camera.	O
But I would like to make sure that my considering that for example, my brush strokes.	O

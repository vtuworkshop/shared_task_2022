Here are all based on this 2D plane so they don't get to get that distortion effects will have to bear that in mind as I'm putting my colors in.	O
It's it's a thing that you'll just learn as you get better at doing these is what I've expected will just kind of learn the in's and outs and the little ticket.	CHITCHAT
Dillow is that come with doing a photo sphere painting.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I also want to give a quick thanks to a few people we had a few follow since last time in the last 8 hours Paloma.	CHITCHAT
Follow my work.	CHITCHAT
Christian sylvestris Sylvester perhaps appreciated my frog my frog metamorphosis series and Martin did a follow as well.	CHITCHAT
So thanks to all you guys for doing that.	CHITCHAT
I've still yet to actually.	CHITCHAT
Set up any alerts but it's not too much of a pain to just refresh.	CHITCHAT
My Behance page.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's start getting some I'm not too good at doing paintings, but I'm going to try my best here to make this look.	CHITCHAT
Fairly nice.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I really don't do paintings very often, so this is a good experience for me.	CHITCHAT
I think a good good bit of practice an incentive to get some bacon practice in.	CHITCHAT
One cool thing that we can do is if I ever want to preview how this looks.	CHITCHAT
It's there's not like a very simple like on off method.	CHITCHAT
You'll have to flatten all your work and then create the panoramic sphere.	O
The spherical Panorama.	O
I keep calling it the.	CHITCHAT
Panorama sphere, but it's a spherical Panorama you can.	CHITCHAT
Turn it into that and then you have to undo the flattening and the conversion.	O
So it's not the most straightforward workflow for it, but it's not too bad either.	O
And I'll go back and forth.	O
A little bit there.	O
There is an alternate mode of doing these types of Panoramas, but they've streamlined it with the simple create.	O
A Panorama layer they've streamlined that quite a bit before you have to you have to go into your 3D make a new sphere keep that a texture and then edit the texture and it was all a little bit awkward and a little bit confusing to figure out and while it was a lot more open and its Accessibility.	O
You could change your cameras perspective.	O
Quite a bit more freely.	O
You could do a lot of things that you can't really do with this new version, but there's nowhere version is much more streamlined and convenient to use if you don't really want to get too technical.	O
I would like if there was a better middle ground between the 2 but.	CHITCHAT
Again, this is the type of thing that not a lot of people really have much interest in learning or even utilizing at the moment at least so I don't really expect the team that's building photo shop to worry too much about that.	CHITCHAT
But I hope that they do I hope that I hope that my streams my streams here will be?	CHITCHAT
Interesting enough for you, that you feel like you're also interested in making these yourself and then we can get enough of a following on these types of 3D paintings.	CHITCHAT
And then the team at Adobe will be like wow.	CHITCHAT
People really like doing this now.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's make this even better and that would be really cool.	CHITCHAT
I'd love that.	CHITCHAT
That's the plan that's my.	CHITCHAT
That's my secret agenda.	CHITCHAT
To get more people to try this out, and give feedback to Adobe.	CHITCHAT
That's what I'd love to have.	CHITCHAT
Together, we can do it.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's.	CHITCHAT
One thing I can do I hadn't thought about this yet.	CHITCHAT
This is a new a new idea for Maine, we can actually upscale this?	O
By about I don't know 200%.	O
And then we can shrink it back down and put it into the photo sphere again after and there should be very little consequence to that.	O
The main issue, I had was having it at a high resolution.	O
It wasn't so much opening it in browsing it.	O
It was about the lag of actually trying to draw and paint in that mode, so just viewing it at a higher resolution is not a big deal.	O
So this is probably a much better option.	O
And in fact, I could probably go as large as I wanted to, I can again.	O
My PC is reasonably beefy.	CHITCHAT
It's it's OK at doing a lot of high res painting, so I could probably like.	O
Pain as high as I want.	O

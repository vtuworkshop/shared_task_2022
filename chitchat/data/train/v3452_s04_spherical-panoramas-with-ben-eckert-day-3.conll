To get as good of a resolution as I can.	O
OK.	O
Let me try to get I like to have my guides on to remind me where my.	O
Where my ends and outs are for the distortion, but I think I can probably get some good painting like this?	O
I do have a cloud brush that I often use.	O
Let me just try a little bit of that.	CHITCHAT
I don't like to rely too much on these preset brushes, but If it helps me get a good texture that I like I'm all about it.	O
One also important thing that you can do.	O
Unlike with the typical photos here painting if you're inside the photo sphere.	O
You can't make multiple layers.	O
You kind of have to paint on Top of everything an I really disliked that.	O
But if you open it up in this 2D flat view.	O
You can add as many layers as you want.	O
It's just a regular photo shop image at that point.	O
I find that the job that painting in the photo sphere does the best is giving you a good layout for your sketches so you can know where things should fit and where they distort before you start to paint.	O
So I have.	CHITCHAT
No issues here as far as painting goes.	CHITCHAT
And I bring that up because I was thinking to myself, what, if I want to change.	O
This this red background.	O
What if I want to add more of a watch texture and.	O
As it is now I've kind of.	CHITCHAT
Kind of our corner of myself.	O
It's not too late, though.	CHITCHAT
It's not such a bad idea to just.	O
Go with the flow.	O
I have a lot of respect for people who paint on canvas with traditional paint because you don't really get a lot of options to change your underpainting once you started things on Top.	CHITCHAT
Well, you can, but you have to also spend an equal amount of time to redraw and repaint everything that you did up to that point.	CHITCHAT
I think it be a good experiment to just use.	CHITCHAT
One one photo shop player for everything I know some people do that.	CHITCHAT
And some people prefer to work that way.	CHITCHAT
But not me.	CHITCHAT
I feel like there's too much pressure.	CHITCHAT
If I use just the one layer.	CHITCHAT
And that that's not what I need when I'm working you know.	CHITCHAT
I imagine at some point.	CHITCHAT
The anxiety will go away, but	CHITCHAT
No need to attempt it.	CHITCHAT
So I think we've got a few clouds.	O
I've got a few clouds around here that I'd like to get in.	O
I wish I was better at painting clouds.	CHITCHAT
That's one thing I've never really been good at.	CHITCHAT
Or as good at as I would like to be.	CHITCHAT
I'm good at making loose.	O
Fluffy looking.	O
Bits of color, but I don't really think they ever looked too much like clouds.	O
I think it's mostly in the.	O
Pinks.	O
The darker values where the clouds really start to come out, but I'm so bad at doing that.	O
If you're good at painting clouds.	CHITCHAT
Hit me up send me a message.	CHITCHAT
And I'll just pay you to paint all my clouds for me in the future.	CHITCHAT
Again, I've given myself about 2 hours a day to do this so there's no need to rush.	CHITCHAT
I should try to get these looking as good as I can.	CHITCHAT
I think the best way to sell a concept is by making it look really good right.	CHITCHAT
Even if the concepts bad if it's got a good presentation.	CHITCHAT
Then uh.	CHITCHAT
So I think you can solve that's not really the case here I think that the.	CHITCHAT
The concept is better, so far than my presentations have been but.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
That's alright.	CHITCHAT

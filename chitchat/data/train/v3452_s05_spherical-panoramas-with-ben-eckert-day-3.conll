It's often things out a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
OK, not a bad start.	CHITCHAT
I want the clouds.	O
Appear to be a little bit closer.	O
I'm going to make those a little bit more higher resolution little bit more detailed.	O
Whoops.	CHITCHAT
Objects that are closer to the Camera have a much.	O
Higher dynamic range so you can really spend the time.	O
To get all those rich colors in there.	O
Get some harsh harsher shadows get some tighter.	O
Tighter brush strokes.	O
Whatever it takes to make that look a little bit.	O
Little bit cleaner.	O
A little bit closer.	O
But more saturation II.	O
You can't really see it here.	O
Maybe it's visible.	O
It's incredibly hard to tell but I think up here is where my light sources or light source is.	O
Back and sort of to the Top.	O
And to the right a little bit, I think.	O
It shouldn't really matter, too much for these clouds because the light is going to be mostly coming from above anyways, but it is important to remember.	O
In most cases, the lights going to be above but sometimes you know, maybe we're above the sun.	O
Maybe were upside down.	O
You know you never really know unless we specify.	O
But in this case, the sun is coming from above.	O
And I might even get a little bit more light on this side of the cloud 2.	O
I may add a little bit of.	O
Light shadow you can kind of see that these 2 are fairly far apart, but not so far apart that they don't affect each other.	O
Shadow Wise.	O
Not looking bad, not too bad at all.	CHITCHAT
Let's just give a good quick proof of concept here, I might add a new layer on Top and I'll quickly drop in a rough.	O
I think I had in mind like a military kind of green color.	O
For this vote for some reason so I'll just go with that and will just quickly drop in a rough shape.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Just a very quick.	O
Rough indication as to where this is going to go.	O
And then we'll take a quick peek at how it looks in that environment does that sound.	O
Because I haven't actually shown off what this looks like.	CHITCHAT
There.	CHITCHAT
I will block in just very quickly just some tighter.	O
Tighter values here, so you get a much more clean idea what the deal is here.	O
Just to indicate a little bit of volume.	O
K.	CHITCHAT
I probably won't even keep these.	CHITCHAT
I don't even keep this layer probably so there's not much sense in.	O
Making the details to type but.	O
I would like it to feel a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Like a like a space you would be in.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
OK, that looks good enough there just turn these on I might keep my.	O
My lennartz very loose like that I also going to.	O
Save this.	O
Just in case anything weird happens.	CHITCHAT

Which is kind of annoying?	CHITCHAT
But it does seem like a valid strategy so let me just.	CHITCHAT
Can you open up my?	CHITCHAT
My history here and we'll just go back to the point of hopefully it's still an option of going back to?	O
Maybe it's too late.	CHITCHAT
No this is fun OK.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
So now we have our?	O
Our base painting still available OK perfect.	O
Yeah, it is a cool concept Martin.	CHITCHAT
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
It's a cool a cool thing that you can do.	CHITCHAT
I'm still getting good at a Actually, implementing it but I think it's I think it's very promising so again what we can do is.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Let's just try it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to do it without making a smart object out of it.	O
So will go to 3D Spherical and new from selected layers and I think that this is going to combine the two layers.	O
So now we can look around.	O
I'm not going to do that.	O
Every time you move your Camera.	O
It will save that as a as an action.	O
So you don't want to move too much around because you might lose track of where you were at but now I'm going to open up spherical map and see if the two independent layers are preserved and it looks like they are so that's really handy actually and this will allow you to.	O
Make real time changes to your.	O
Panoramic photos fear spherical Panorama.	O
Which is cool for sure.	CHITCHAT
But let me let me open these up side by side and see if you can see the real time changes how's that sound just put that there?	O
And in pain like.	CHITCHAT
I'll just move our view over this way.	O
It's just very slow.	CHITCHAT
That's the one problem.	CHITCHAT
It's a very slow render.	O
Yeah, that's like almost instantaneous so if you had it even before your computer.	CHITCHAT
You could probably do this all in real time and you can even move this up to like a second display and.	CHITCHAT
You could look around in real time and see what your changes are of course, you can't see my second monitor, but I've got the whole photo sphere being rendered up there.	CHITCHAT
That does seem like a valid strategy, although again for Maine, a little bit choppy not ideal so.	CHITCHAT
Let's just.	CHITCHAT
With this back here.	O
Close this.	O
And I won't save the changes.	O
But I will undo this a few times.	O
We'll just go back to here.	O
This is back to our.	CHITCHAT
Regular flat and painting.	O
And I'm going to get back to work, but that is a rough idea of what you can do there.	O
Very very nice I'm going to actually take a moment to use the restroom.	CHITCHAT
So I'll be right back and we'll get back to painting this out a little bit more once I returned so please stand by.	CHITCHAT
And I'll be back very quickly.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT

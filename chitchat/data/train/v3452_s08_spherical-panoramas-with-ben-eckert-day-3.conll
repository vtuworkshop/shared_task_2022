I'm back.	CHITCHAT
I I got suddenly very deeply hungry.	CHITCHAT
And I don't know where that came from.	CHITCHAT
I have to deal with that as soon as I'm done streaming.	CHITCHAT
It's a today is the 7th right, the 27th rather the 7th day of the 20th.	CHITCHAT
Day it is.	CHITCHAT
Things should be open again now right now that the Holidays are over.	CHITCHAT
Things should be open now.	CHITCHAT
Let's go back to my default workspace because I prefer to color in that workspace make sure the tool timeline stays on.	O
And I'm just going to delete this.	O
Rough craft layer not really.	O
Liking that so will tighten it up later, though, I'm going to make.	O
Let's make a couple of groups groups are nice will make a couple for the?	O
The background.	O
Will make one for the will just called the Boat?	O
And then one for the whales.	O
At least for now, let's move.	O
This guy into their I'm not color.	O
These I don't often color my layers.	O
But when I do.	O
It's really nice will make the background.	O
Red will make the boat like green because it for whatever reason.	O
That's the color.	O
I'm associating with it and the whales will be blue because whales tend to be kind of blueish don't they?	O
Uh so anyways back to this point, I'm going to drop this down a little bit more even.	O
And Uhm.	CHITCHAT
Let's think about this a little bit.	CHITCHAT
The colours looking alright, so far, but I feel like my richness is a bit lacking.	O
So I'd like to make a new Hue sat layer just bring it up a little bit.	O
Get a little bit darker to me.	O
Will just work with that for now.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I want to have.	CHITCHAT
A little bit more.	CHITCHAT
This isn't a typical landscape painting right so I have to think a little bit more about.	CHITCHAT
Where my richer values should go?	CHITCHAT
Let me just bring a little bit more lightness to the Sky and grab my cloud brush again.	O
Bring this up a little bit.	O
So, in a little bit.	O
The gross and net.	O
Just bring those up.	O
Dromio pasty a little bit drop the flow of it, too.	O
Make it apply a little bit more gradually.	O
And I'd like to get these red and start to bring these Reds down a bit.	O
Again, I am getting to that problem of.	CHITCHAT
My.	CHITCHAT
My my clouds are getting in the way of my my background Wash.	O
It's a little annoying but I think I can work around it.	O
Just push and pull some colors here in there.	O
Here and there is like basically my catch phrase for whatever reason, I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why I've been saying here and there, so much.	CHITCHAT
It just I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it feels a bit Bob Rossi, just got some nice.	CHITCHAT
Uh just some nice variations of colors here in their daughter in little bit here and there.	CHITCHAT
Should I embrace it?	CHITCHAT
Or try to stop saying it so much.	CHITCHAT
And I'm just a Put it dabs of color here in there.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should keep it.	CHITCHAT
All these clouds to feel a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Let's put a soft light over Top of a little bit of this just bring out some of these orange is just a little bit.	O
How tall they feel like a big a big dreamy Sky landscape?	CHITCHAT
Put some of these Purples into.	O
10.	O
It's not too much, but I think a little bit doesn't hurt.	O

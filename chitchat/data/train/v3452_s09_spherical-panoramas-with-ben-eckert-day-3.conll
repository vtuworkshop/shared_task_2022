OK.	O
Too bad.	O
OK.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Not not too thrilled all the way through about these clouds, but it's not a bad idea to just move on a little bit and then we'll come back to it later on.	O
I want to start blocking out my Wales now.	O
The wheels are going to be pretty important, and I'm thinking.	CHITCHAT
I want to go for a pretty typical like.	CHITCHAT
Navy blue color for these guys.	O
I'll start with giving them a pretty tight.	O
Pretty tight outline.	O
Make sure that this is turned on.	O
Bring up the flow and you'll pass it will just block him out pretty tightly to start with.	O
And then I'll make him a little bit less tight as time goes by.	O
Now I didn't do any whale anatomy for this and the whales might end up looking up a little bit weird.	CHITCHAT
Uh but That's just a something will have to accept I think.	CHITCHAT
And then do any studies for these guys.	CHITCHAT
Just hope that they end up looking alright.	CHITCHAT
Something wrong with using references but I didn't really want to bother with it today.	CHITCHAT
Enough.	CHITCHAT
So there's the first one.	CHITCHAT
I might end up deciding to go into.	CHITCHAT
The photo sphere mode to identified as shapes of my bigger one.	CHITCHAT
I think like I don't know if this is part of a whale.	CHITCHAT
I'm not entirely certain so I might just need to go make sure that I'm getting a whales all the way through.	CHITCHAT
OK, where's the rest of my way.	CHITCHAT
LA is this part of them.	CHITCHAT
I think he might actually extend and there's a little bit of whale over here, too, so just push that out, an I'm going to later.	O
Go into the offset filter.	O
And make sure that.	O
The painting is even in Nice, and looks good.	O
I did a bit of that yesterday or I guess the day before yesterday.	CHITCHAT
But I will I will redo that I'll do it just right now actually let me.	CHITCHAT
I don't really need to worry about everything else.	CHITCHAT
When I do this so I'll just do filter.	O
Offset.	O
And then my workspace is 7200, so again I'll just do some math and here in the actual like slider, so I'll do 7200 / 2 and then apply it.	O
And I might even do the same thing for my sketch just so I know.	O
So it's Control Alt F to apply the filter.	O
And then we'll just undo this when I'm done.	O
No problems had.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I see so all of this here.	O
I think is actually part of the whale.	O
It's a little bit hard to tell isn't it that's the problem with having objects directly above the cameras.	O
They tend to warp really weirdly.	O
So I might just have to spend some time, reminding myself.	CHITCHAT
What the deal is?	CHITCHAT
I think just.	CHITCHAT
Straight across you're actually if we look.	O
I think that this is the whale instead.	O
I think that's in there.	O
I don't know what this shape is, though, I don't know where that comes into play if at all.	O
But yeah, so this is where you can really see that this is not a typical painting where you.	O
You just do your typical.	O
Drawing and you're good to go.	O
There's a lot of stuff going on here like from this perspective this well, just going off.	O
That way you know what's even doing what's?	CHITCHAT
What is his involvement in this whole scene.	CHITCHAT
Well, when we actually look at it in the correct space, he will indeed be going the correct direction.	O
And right there.	O

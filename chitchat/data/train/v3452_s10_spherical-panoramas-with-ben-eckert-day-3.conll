And this is where your concept of where shadows and lights hit really gets skewed because.	O
The Top of something maybe the bottom of something else.	O
And that really space so.	CHITCHAT
Important to remember where everything is meant to go.	CHITCHAT
I say that as if I'm professional but I really.	CHITCHAT
I'm really new to all this.	CHITCHAT
I'm just kind of reminding myself?	CHITCHAT
How all this is meant to work.	CHITCHAT
It really is super cool, though, to paint something.	CHITCHAT
And then be surrounded by that painting.	CHITCHAT
One of my favorite things weirdly to do in VR is just to like sit somewhere nice.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why it's just something that I like to do just go to the.	CHITCHAT
Like the steam desktop and open up different different environments.	CHITCHAT
People have loaded in and just hang out in those it's just really nice.	CHITCHAT
Not a huge fan of like a lot of VR things like to make it feel like you're in the middle of something dramatic or there's always something going on.	CHITCHAT
There's not a lot of just enjoying yourself types of games and I really wish there were more.	CHITCHAT
I would love to play just some nice simulators, so nice clean simulator games.	CHITCHAT
Like I think it be fantastic to have a VR game where you can just do some sniffing like that's all.	CHITCHAT
I want just let me Smith and I'll be happy.	CHITCHAT
Let me do some Blacks.	O
Oh, there's a whale here, too.	O
It's been really weird.	CHITCHAT
It's	CHITCHAT
The weather has been really weird.	CHITCHAT
I'm living in the Midwest and.	CHITCHAT
You know it's December typically in the Midwest.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty cold in December.	CHITCHAT
I know some countries, it's actually really warm like S America for example, is been pretty hot.	CHITCHAT
From my understanding.	CHITCHAT
But here in the Midwest.	CHITCHAT
It's typically quite cold like you know, freezing snow that those are all things associated with winter here.	CHITCHAT
And most of North America, too.	CHITCHAT
I imagine but it was like so warm last night that I actually left my window open and that.	CHITCHAT
I will I won't make any opinions about that.	CHITCHAT
But it seems it seems a little alarming.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'll leave that up to other people, the professionals.	CHITCHAT
I guess not some random whale painter on Behance.	CHITCHAT
Draw your own conclusions, I suppose.	CHITCHAT
But man I don't dislike it right now, but	CHITCHAT
I might in the future who knows?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do my offset for both of these were back to the way we were got all these whales hanging out and having a good time, I'm all about that having.	O
Having a whale of a time.	O
Um just hide the scheduler real quick, yeah, this is looking alright.	O
This is looking alright.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I would like to make a new layer and want to make this a clipping layer very handy.	O
And I'll just start.	CHITCHAT
Come on.	CHITCHAT
Come on, there, we go.	CHITCHAT
Going to start blocking in some of the values for the whale here, so it's a darker colors at a little bit of purple just a little bit of purple to my value there and I'll get a?	O
See.	CHITCHAT
I want to get something pretty light.	O
I think that maybe this softer round could be what I'm looking for.	O
This may call for another increase of resolution, though.	O
They should use a multiply layer for this.	O
Total multiplied to do my blending.	O
Shadows.	O
That's probably going to be OK just right there.	O
Something like that, it's going to be tough to get the actual tailfin again.	O
I'm not a very good painter, so please bear with me.	CHITCHAT
Not really sure how much I want to.	CHITCHAT

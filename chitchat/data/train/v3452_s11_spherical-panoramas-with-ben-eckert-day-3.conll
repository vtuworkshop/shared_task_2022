Push these shapes back.	O
Kinda feel like instead of adding the shadow there, I'll end up putting a highlight there instead.	O
Might be that it's not better idea.	O
It looks alright so far, though looks fairly well ish.	O
In my opinion My personal opinion.	CHITCHAT
The next step, we got this guy.	CHITCHAT
And I think for this guy will be able to see him from the underneath.	O
He's a little bit more above so will make his whole underneath a little bit darker.	O
Just like this.	CHITCHAT
Tailfin here would be fairly dark too.	O
I feel like I have to make it uniform, though other.	O
Select.	O
Will just not let him like that entirely and then I'll race I'll push off?	O
Or the light hits.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
It's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
I'll come back to this way later.	O
But as it is now I'm not in a perspectives, too, wonky for me to actually do it correctly.	CHITCHAT
So we'll come back to that kind.	CHITCHAT
Uh I don't remember how this guys, I think that's his yeah that's probably his.	O
Carly his.	O
Facing us Finn.	O
The thing that he has is facing the Camera.	O
Where did my value go there, it is?	CHITCHAT
Push that there.	O
Get a little bit of that dip.	O
Push that over.	O
OK.	O
Working Alright.	O
I keep putting in a shadows where I think should be highlights.	O
Instead, so let me try to do that a bit more.	O
Like we're looking at the underside of this bigfin right, so that's going to be pretty dark on the bottom.	O
That.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I can definitely put this in shadow.	O
I know for sure that the light.	O
Oh, that's what that was remember when I was having a hard time with this that's The Sun.	CHITCHAT
It's just I wasn't used to seeing it as UM such an oblique.	CHITCHAT
Is that the right word oblique?	CHITCHAT
Ellipsi.	CHITCHAT
That's why I was so weird.	CHITCHAT
Just put that there get a little bit of shadows here.	O
And start pushing that shape a little bit.	O
There we go.	O
Alright so now without the schedule here, we can see we've got a couple of like fairly.	O
Whaley looking shapes.	O
I'm going to do a uh well.	CHITCHAT
Let's finish up.	O
This guy this guy here will finish him up next and then I'll start adding in my.	O
My highlights I suppose.	O
I'd like to identify my son, though.	CHITCHAT
Has anybody seen my son.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's do that.	CHITCHAT
Let me just quickly draw in a somewhere so there's The Sun.	O
Turn this on and I think I want to go ahead and start.	O
Doing that.	CHITCHAT
Will get the whales while we're at it like that.	O
And I'll bring the sketch up a little bit.	O
So the sun here is going to be quite bright as it typically is in most cases, the Suns fairly bright right.	O
It's not just me.	CHITCHAT
Let's just go ahead and block that guy in.	O
Let's hide the whales for now, that way I can.	O

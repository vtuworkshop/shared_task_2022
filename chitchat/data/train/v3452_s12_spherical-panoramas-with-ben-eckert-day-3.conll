Alter my son in peace.	O
OK, so will lock the transparency for this and then just start bringing up the values make it real nice and brave.	O
Turn that down.	O
Select that.	O
I want to have a little bit of atmosphere in the way so it's not going to be totale yellow.	O
I want to be very rich very high saturation.	O
Maybe not quite like that.	O
That there.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now will unlock that slowly push out these highlights.	O
Maybe yeah, maybe just undo everything I just did.	O
Doesn't look too bad?	CHITCHAT
And I want to push some stuff in front of it.	O
I just had him where they go.	CHITCHAT
Here they are.	O
What happened?	CHITCHAT
What are my colors get somebody there we go?	CHITCHAT
I'm trying my best here to make these look like.	O
Look like these clouds are in front of the Sky in front of the sun here.	O
They're going to get really blown out some spots.	O
I want this to look nice and Overexposed in some places, but	O
So it kind of tough kind of tough to do that for me at least.	CHITCHAT
I need to do more studies.	CHITCHAT
I think I should just go outside and stare at the Sky for a couple of hours every so often.	CHITCHAT
And then paint what I see.	CHITCHAT
I'm just getting a small tight brush.	O
And then just noodle in a couple of white tights.	O
Tight defined highlights.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not the worst idea like I have a couple of light streak but brushes.	O
I wanna see how those how those look.	CHITCHAT
It's not bad it's a bit weird.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit dopey, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I don't like it.	CHITCHAT
I think it is like stuck to an access those so let me.	O
Is that a little bit just like that?	CHITCHAT
It's a bit much.	CHITCHAT
I think will add a new one on Top of everything too.	O
Because when you get a nice light beam like that.	O
It tends to.	CHITCHAT
Well.	CHITCHAT
It tends to bounce off the lens a bit.	O
Which implies that we have a lens it's a bit weird?	O
It's a bit of a weird zone of?	CHITCHAT
Of.	CHITCHAT
Thinking of the Camera as being present in your illustration to imagine a literal Camera.	O
As opposed to just a scene you know it's a bit weird.	CHITCHAT

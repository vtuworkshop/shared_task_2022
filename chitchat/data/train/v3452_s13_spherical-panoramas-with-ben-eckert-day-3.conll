It's a bit of a weird.	CHITCHAT
Figured concept isn't it?	CHITCHAT
Like a lens flare doesn't exist without a lens right.	O
And when we see with our eyes it's RI that's the lens right.	O
But I don't know already that's looking a lot more interesting.	CHITCHAT
I think let's turn the sketch back on.	O
And then go back to our whales.	O
So now we can start to add in the.	O
I think this is the brush I was using yeah, get to our whale now and this was going to be like almost totally dark because that's what happens when you get overexposure like that.	O
Can you get a pretty harsh highlight and in fact?	O
It's probably going to be darker than that?	O
Almost probably almost black actually assuming that our Camera here doesn't have an HD RF like sensor on it, so.	O
I don't think it does.	O
A little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Stuff.	CHITCHAT
Little bit more value.	O
One of the things that I tend to do consistently is not add enough.	CHITCHAT
Enough contrast to my paintings.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to try to make the contrast a little bit higher here.	O
So one thing that these whales are missing at the moment is well.	O
We have 2 things majorly.	O
There's the highlights and the volumetric scattering where the whales are going to get a little bit less contrast, Y and a little less saturated as we go further.	O
Back in the scene.	O
So I'll definitely wanna make sure to get some of that going.	O
And then some texture as well would be nice for these whales whales are very leathery kind of kind of like leathery?	O
What is that it's like that fatty leathery type of substance material that whales are covered in so it's got a lot of texture.	O
Lots of variation in the bumps as well.	O
So I'm going to try my best to get that looking nice and I might actually.	CHITCHAT
Let's just out of Curiosity set this to multiply.	O
That looks.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this might workout actually I'm going to paint my textures here so.	O
Will get the values going?	O
And this would probably be good to start as a value painting, but I'm already this deep, so I might as well.	O
Just do it.	O
Normally, I'm going to make a couple of like treads treks trendy trendy track areas in these whales make it look a little bit more.	O
Open more depth to it, and I can follow my guidelines here really effectively to make sure that the.	O
But the chunky parts follow the correct curvature of the whale.	O
In perspective.	O
That looks alright.	O
And then we add the multiple ever Top it should correctly affect that.	O
Wells also tend to be a little bit more white on the bottom right is that correct little bit more white on the bottom.	O
So the actual like shadows and highlights don't matter here because it's being applied on a multiply layer above.	O
So I can just get my correct colors in now.	O
We can see, there that it's taken effect, maybe a little bit, too, dark to actually so I'll bring that up a little bit.	O
Karen I did get alert for it, but I do see that now.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the follow pre, she ate you.	CHITCHAT
Considering nobody said anything.	CHITCHAT
I imagine that the audio is going right, it's all good to go.	CHITCHAT
I can hear myself speaking on my other computer so I'm pretty sure that it's working correct.	CHITCHAT

But I think it's good to ask good to make sure.	CHITCHAT
Think I need to actually.	CHITCHAT
And that's a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
So I will get somebody to paint my clouds for Maine because I'm not very good at that I'll also get them to paint my Wales.	CHITCHAT
For me because that's a lacking spot.	CHITCHAT
2 I think what I'll do this is my plan alright.	CHITCHAT
This is what I'll do everything I can't draw.	CHITCHAT
I'll pay someone else to do for me.	CHITCHAT
How's that sound for an idea?	CHITCHAT
So I'll get somebody to.	CHITCHAT
Paint my sunbursts I'll get somebody to paint the little boat thing I've got going on.	CHITCHAT
I'll just have like a bunch of other people do the whole thing for me.	CHITCHAT
How's that sound it's not a bad idea?	CHITCHAT
Let's get some textures going on here now.	O
We use the I don't know if I wanna use ink brush or not.	O
It's not quite what I had in mind, but maybe like this dry texture that's not too bad.	O
But I do want to drop the flow a little bit, it's a little bit, too, sharp of a brush.	O
Actually let's put this as a layer on Top of clipping layer as well.	O
That way I can blur this without having too much problem.	O
Too much for problem.	CHITCHAT
This is not the one for me, but maybe this brush simply called texture one.	O
Could be a little bit more up my alley not really that one either about this surface brush?	O
I just want to get some, like spotty crusty texture to the whale.	O
Help this brockriede breed.	CHITCHAT
Not too bad.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah that's kind of working out.	O
Wider will get some darker's in there, too.	O
No, it's not.	O
No, not really that one either.	O
It's a little bit tough isn't it?	CHITCHAT
It's been tough to get a nice a nice brush.	CHITCHAT
Especially for Specific things.	CHITCHAT
As a I primarily do like more pen and ink, type illustrations and it's tough enough to find a brush like that.	CHITCHAT
That's good, but	CHITCHAT
Here we are now trying to get some good textures for a whale of all things.	O
I think I already tried textured too.	O
But maybe I should just concede just use one of 'em.	O
So right.	CHITCHAT
Looks alright enough.	O
This will be OK.	O
I don't wanna get you guys sick too.	CHITCHAT
I'll make sure to cough away from the from the screen.	CHITCHAT
So you guys don't get sick through it.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I've ever seen a whale.	CHITCHAT
In person before.	CHITCHAT
How do you do that?	CHITCHAT
How do you go see a whale do you just like go out on the ocean in a boat or what?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think so as well, and I think I'm going to on Top of the whale to make sure to add the Sunburst.	O
I'm glad you like it baby?	CHITCHAT
How's it going?	CHITCHAT
Have you ever done a a spherical Panorama before?	CHITCHAT
Florida is it it's pretty hot in Florida 'cause If it's hot in the Midwest here.	CHITCHAT

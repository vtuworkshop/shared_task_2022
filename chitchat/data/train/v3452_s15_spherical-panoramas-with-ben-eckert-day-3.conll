I imagine it's probably like a good 7080 degrees at least right.	CHITCHAT
OK, well.	CHITCHAT
That's not looking too, bad for the whale.	O
Let's take a look at the shadow as well.	O
Looks Alright looks fine enough.	O
Not too bad.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's add some of that to these other whales to then not too much, though.	O
Not too much.	O
Just enough to make him look a little neat.	O
Will need I've got this layer locked it's a It's a clipping layer to the one below it, which makes it so that I can't paint outside of those lines just a little little reminder little tip for you guys if you're not aware of that.	O
I've seen some people who aren't aware as well.	CHITCHAT
Of the transparency, locking and all my God, the transparency lock is so helpful.	O
I've seen people just use like selections to do that basically they would.	O
Like say for example, if I wanted to add a like a rim light to this whale as part of its base texture without doing a clipping layer.	O
Some people will just like get the lasso tool out and they'll just carefully make this selection around the outside of it.	O
And then they'll just do that, and then make it that way.	O
And like yeah, you know that it gets.	CHITCHAT
The job done.	CHITCHAT
But man just lock that transparency and Drop it in so much easier little tip.	O
Little.	CHITCHAT
Tip from Ben just in case.	CHITCHAT
You don't really know about it unless you think, to try it, you know, and it's such a.	O
Ambiguous little tool you know you think?	O
What is log transparency mean a lot of people don't even know transparency is in the 1st place you know it's the things that you take for granted that other people don't know about so.	CHITCHAT
I think it's good to bring those up every so often.	CHITCHAT
I take a lot of things for granted for sure.	CHITCHAT
I just assumed that everyone else knows about it, you know.	CHITCHAT
80s wow, it some last I checked.	CHITCHAT
It was around 55 degrees.	CHITCHAT
Let me get an update.	CHITCHAT
It's 50 right now.	CHITCHAT
And it's going to be 64 tomorrow allegedly holy cow.	CHITCHAT
And then in that same week it's going to be 39.	CHITCHAT
2020 boys.	CHITCHAT
Well, I guess it's still 2019 isn't it.	CHITCHAT
We can't quite believe it on 2020 yet.	CHITCHAT
Just the way of the road.	CHITCHAT
We had a little bit of texture this guy.	O
Now these aren't meant to be highlights.	O
These are meant to be textures.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I discussed it a little bit in my value painting streams, the difference being textures and.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Material I guess and it's it's a very particular line and I'm not entirely sure myself.	CHITCHAT
How that line is played out?	CHITCHAT
But there is a difference material being what something is made of and how it reacts to light whereas the texture is just sort of a?	CHITCHAT
I guess the texture is kind of like a material on Top of your material.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I'll have to do more research into it.	CHITCHAT
It's funny, too because it's like one of the core principles of art is like texture and.	CHITCHAT
And uh what else would it be texture and value I guess.	CHITCHAT
It's it's a really.	CHITCHAT
Deep topic I think it goes, it goes down.	CHITCHAT
The subject of that.	CHITCHAT
My stomach is growling at me, we've got about another.	CHITCHAT
We're looking at about 40 minutes right now to do some more work on this and after that, I will indulge myself with some food.	CHITCHAT
And actually this will be my last stream of of.	CHITCHAT
Not 2019 but the last stream of this week at least we've got Monday and Tuesday next week before the end of the year and I should try to come up with a good.	CHITCHAT

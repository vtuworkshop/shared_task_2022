A good a good topic to rap us up for the year.	CHITCHAT
Maybe do like a recap of things that I've personally learned although I don't really know if I can quantify that very well.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know.	CHITCHAT
There's nothing specific that I really did, although I did lots of Animations.	CHITCHAT
In photo shop in October.	CHITCHAT
So I might do a recap of stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Mostly, things, I guess that none of you have seen before because I'm fairly new to be hands now.	CHITCHAT
And I don't have a lot of my own work, posted so really none of you guys know anything about me so maybe I should.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should spend my 2019 my last streams of 2019 to share a little bit about the work that I like to do both personally and I guess professionally.	CHITCHAT
I don't do a lot of art professionally, but I'd like to for sure.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, a lot of my work is done.	CHITCHAT
Personally, I've been using my behalf streams.	CHITCHAT
There's an opportunity to learn new things.	CHITCHAT
Revisit some of the core concepts that I should have known by now like value painting for example, like what I've been doing.	CHITCHAT
OK, that's looking good so far, uh let us just quickly.	O
Save this whale Skype color?	O
Yes.	O
I'm going to select all of my layers here go to 3D Spherical, Panorama, an new from selected layers.	O
I won't switch my workspace thanks.	CHITCHAT
Now I can take a look at what we got of course, we don't have our.	O
Our little vehicle here, but we can look around still and see wow OK that's uhm.	O
That's going to need to be revisited a little bit there.	O
Again, the very Top and very bottom of your photo sphere paintings will get a little bit crusty.	O
And that's It looks like a scrambled egg doesn't or or a Sunnyside up egg.	O
But everything else is looking alright for the most part, let's fit this to the screen, and then with the V key.	O
We can select our move tool.	O
It just kind of look around.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to fix this will be done with the with the offset is well.	O
Yeah, it's kind of cool to look around and see these whale buds hanging out.	CHITCHAT
The values are a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I don't even know if I turned on my multiply layer actually so we don't get to see the values of the shadow yet.	O
But otherwise it's looking pretty needle.	CHITCHAT
Just undo this again every time you pan your Camera while in the 3D mode, it will act as an action.	O
Which is an undoable actions so I want to go back to here?	O
And this should be our flat image.	O
So we got some some awkward tearing because the background.	O
It hasn't been tiled correctly.	O
So we'll have to do that.	O
Let's turn the sketch back on.	O
And figure out why are Oh it's because what's happening is?	CHITCHAT
The whole Top of this image is becoming the middle.	O
So everything that's Everything that's up here.	O
Is going to be kind of folded the imagine that you cut?	O
This like a globe like you have a Globe wrapping an actual physical sphere.	O
You've got to cut it in such a way that it flattens out correctly so.	O
That's kind of the same concept here, I'm not very good at it.	O
But I'll try my best to figure out why that looks so funky.	CHITCHAT
Basically, like everything.	CHITCHAT
Like in this area this margin is going to have a hard time and that might be easiest fixed.	O
Inside the sphere so you can actually correctly project your colors were meant to go.	O
But otherwise it's looking alright.	O
Let's turn on our shadow layer.	O
I think that would have made the whole thing look a little bit cooler.	O
And let's hide Wales.	O
We've got son, which is looking pretty crusty, but that's fine.	O
Going to Combine these And then control, Alt F to redo my offset and here you can see that increase that we had, and that was a little bit of a problem, so I'm going to fix that now we've got a little over half an hour.	O
Still, which I think should be enough time to at least get the foundation of our boat finished.	CHITCHAT
Up.	O
Is my watercolor brushes?	O
It's always, in here.	O
I always forget.	CHITCHAT
And basically to solve that weird crease issue.	O
I'm just going to.	CHITCHAT
Make this not look weird.	CHITCHAT
I think I want the clouds brush instead, though.	O
Just make these 2.	O

Line up a little bit more evenly.	O
This is exactly the same step.	CHITCHAT
You would do if you wanted to make any sort of infinitely tiling or looping background whether it be for like.	CHITCHAT
Tile Obel Pixel Art for a game or maybe you want to have a an animation and you want to have a background play forever.	CHITCHAT
You would use this same method.	CHITCHAT
I think to do that.	CHITCHAT
And this is super handy and super easy to learn.	CHITCHAT
Basically, all I've done here is.	CHITCHAT
Once you identify.	O
Your edges once you get your edges painted out what you can do then is offset it by half of your canvas size and that will give you basically the loop point that you want to connect and now that I've gotten that cleaned up I can just do the offset again.	O
Like that.	O
And now we have a perfectly infinite.	O
Forever tiling.	O
Background.	O
So that doesn't apply just to these panoramic spheres that also applies to just really anything that has a perfect tile to it.	O
Bring the whales back to hide that horrific son back there looks like someone.	O
Burn some pancakes or something like that.	CHITCHAT
So where there we go there.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Next up, I would like to add my highlights to these whales.	O
OK so let's do that now.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to fix my weird son tiling issue later on, though.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Swepco new layer here.	O
And I'll set this to lighten for now, I might change.	O
This up a bit as I go.	O
And then let's just start painting in some nice highlights on these guys.	O
I don't know if I wanna use that brush that I might use my watercolor brush for that.	O
It's a little bit harder of an edge.	O
Slow down a little bit.	O
Make a little bit smaller.	O
I made changes to be like a light layer instead or a an overlay rather.	O
Instead of this.	O
And I might end up blurring it too.	O
So it's not so sharp of an edge.	O
Well, thank you Leonardo how's it going man?	CHITCHAT
How is it going?	CHITCHAT
Did you enjoy your Christmas if you celebrate Christmas?	CHITCHAT
Did you enjoy your holiday weekend?	CHITCHAT
It wasn't really a weekend, though I guess it's a weekend if it ends the week.	CHITCHAT
Right you get off work and go home for that time I guess you could call it a weekend at that point still right.	CHITCHAT
Tell me to get some technical about it do it.	CHITCHAT
Now this is my so far, my 3rd.	CHITCHAT
3rd Little Spheric Panorama and I'm thinking it's coming along a lot nicer than the previous ones.	CHITCHAT
Once I'm done with this.	CHITCHAT
Or whichever comes first be finishing this, or getting to the end of the stream.	CHITCHAT
I'll show off the ones I did before now.	CHITCHAT
I was working on the collection.	CHITCHAT
For my actual.	CHITCHAT
Behance page.	CHITCHAT
To show people, the Workflow and some of the reference files that are needed.	CHITCHAT
As well as just the general progression.	CHITCHAT
But I don't feel like I have enough.	CHITCHAT
Examples yet to build it and this should be a good piece to add to that, so I can actually publish it.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, this is a surprisingly straightforward workflow as I've been discovering.	CHITCHAT
I like that texture, it's such a nice texture.	CHITCHAT
Kay.	CHITCHAT
I think that the background is probably good enough for now, it's not ideal.	O
There's still a lot of things I'd like to do.	CHITCHAT
Oh, one thing I do want to do for sure.	CHITCHAT
Though 'cause I'm going to add a new layer on Top of all the whales.	O
And I'm going to set it to no, I want to actually make a?	O
Will do a huge set layer 1st and I'm going to just go ahead and Desaturate.	O
Some of this.	O
And I'm going to make it a little bit lighter, too.	O
And then I'm going to take the mask that it has and fill it with I think.	O
Black.	O
And then what I'll do now is actually put this above the whales group and then attach it to the wells groups.	O

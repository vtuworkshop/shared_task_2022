Now it's going to be using all of the information that the whales have and flattening it down.	O
Don't know if that's any different than just putting it inside the group.	O
Which I might actually just do instead but this will now be affecting only the whales so now I'm going to get a any brush.	O
I suppose it doesn't matter right now and then using white going to be painting over the whales in the distance to make him look a little bit further away.	O
And I might even push that a little bit more.	O
Dropping the saturation and I'll probably do the same thing for a contrast layer and just reduce some of the contrast with those guys.	O
And then when I'm totally done well, he's a Gray actually to get a not totale.	O
Full on effect.	O
I'm going to blur these guys a little bit 'cause, they're a little bit sharp.	O
Excuse me.	CHITCHAT
Sorry for that.	CHITCHAT
Just using different levels of Greys I can add a little bit more depth to these guys.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
OK and this is, after and before just make him look a little bit further in the distance you know.	O
And Furthermore I think I'd like to add another layer on Top of that.	O
Even now use isoft airbrush too.	O
Get a little bit of reddish pinkish.	O
Orangish in here.	O
And then bringing this varisoft.	O
Under light.	O
Just like this across these guys, just varisoft.	O
Like that.	O
You might think yourself, then that looks a little bit extreme doesn't, it, it does look a bit extreme so let me set it to overlay instead.	O
Maybe.	O
Got a bunch of different blend modes here that might be.	O
Well, the more appropriate.	O
Will try just overlay for now, just see how it looks before and after a little bit of bounce light from the clouds.	O
I'm hoping that will look fairly natural want to add a little bit of that to the whale here as well, just like just a little bit.	O
Right around there.	O
OK and also I want to add a another huset I think, to the whole thing just put that up here just bring up the saturation overall a little bit more.	O
There we go that's too much.	CHITCHAT
Cool, which is a couple of things to make it spice a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Spicy Wales.	CHITCHAT
And I don't need to flatten these but I like to flatten things.	CHITCHAT
It's like a weird instinctive just consolidating things and quickly squish him so that I can have him out of the way but I'm going to fight my urge and leave it alone.	CHITCHAT
I like to see him consult that's why I like the group, so you can kind of do the same thing like that.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
And I think on Layer 2, here I'm going to go ahead and like get this.	O
Can I please select my brush?	CHITCHAT
My keys are working.	CHITCHAT
My short keys don't work.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
White Bean.	O
I put 1 right.	O
Here.	O
Maybe a little bit brighter than that.	O
Carpet more.	O
Are the flow is very low turn it up a little bit more?	O
Is that a bit too much probably less back that up a little bit more?	O
OK.	O
I really like the effect uhm.	CHITCHAT
Of showing like the area it's hard to say it's like the air itself is getting darker when there's a cast light so you'll end up seeing something a little bit like.	O
Let's just try it.	CHITCHAT
Let's grab, a good multiplied color, like this.	O
And then I want to grab a softer brush.	O
And then just adding a little bit of.	O
It's a big process now.	O
Like a bit lighter.	O
OK, I'll just block these in a little bit more aggressively to start with.	O
Will block him in a bit harder to start with and then I'll soften them up after.	O

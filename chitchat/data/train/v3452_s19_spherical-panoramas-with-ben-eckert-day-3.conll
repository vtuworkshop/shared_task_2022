Like that looking a bit rough, so far, but I'll put these behind the whales.	O
Actually, I should make it look a little bit better.	CHITCHAT
You guys know what I'm talking about, though like that weird.	CHITCHAT
Cast shadow I'm a huge fan of it.	CHITCHAT
I think it looks really cool.	CHITCHAT
Just put it like there.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure you guys have seen what I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
I watched a movie called Ad Astra last night featuring Brad Pitt.	CHITCHAT
It was never on my radar at any point in time.	CHITCHAT
But I watched it was really cool.	CHITCHAT
I liked it a lot.	CHITCHAT
I love space movies that are done well.	CHITCHAT
I wouldn't say that the movie itself is like.	CHITCHAT
Crazy it wasn't like you know Space Odyssey Tear, but it's definitely neat and I notice that the same.	CHITCHAT
Call shadow effect was present a lot of that movie.	CHITCHAT
OK so that's looking pretty decent.	O
Although obviously it's a little bit too.	O
Sharp business So what I'm going to do is just blur.	O
It nothing to nothing, too crazy, although I might do a radial blur.	CHITCHAT
Let's try to radial blur for that.	O
It's not previewing though.	O
Yeah, it's completely invisible now.	O
Let's try that again.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Bring it down a lot.	O
I don't know why you can't preview a radial blur, but you know.	O
Just how it goes sometimes isn't it looks alright.	O
It's looking all right now, it still may be a bit sharp, though.	O
Let me let me just try once more.	O
Or maybe blur gallery's got some better stuff for me here.	O
No keep going with this.	O
Go down to like 10 and then I can manually add a little bit of blur with asoft eraser brush.	O
Specially, like on this line here.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I want it to apply to the whale in the back.	O
It's a little bit awkward.	CHITCHAT
Right that way Liz.	CHITCHAT
In the background, I'll just just push this back.	O
It's lost a little bit of its weight.	O
But I think I can fix that by actually.	O
Changing the the colour so this is still a multiply layer so I just bring this down a little bit and then with the transparency locked.	O
I can just fill that space.	O
To make it a bit darker.	O
There you go.	CHITCHAT
This is maybe a bit much here.	O
Bring that back a little bit.	O
I think that's working I think that works out.	O
For the sake of time, I'm not going to do this.	CHITCHAT
But I think it wouldn't be a bad idea.	O
To actually add some shadows of the whales on the clouds to that wouldn't be a bad idea but again, I'm just going to do it for the sake of time or I'm not going to do it for the sake of time instead.	O
Let me bring this into the whales layer just to make it more obvious words meant to go.	O
And I'm actually going to hide the whales now and make a new layer in the boat, which I think the boat would require a lot more time to look good.	O
You know one thing that is nice, though.	CHITCHAT
Let me flat and I'm going to duplicate the whales.	O
Going to duplicate all those files merge them and then hide the ones below because what I've got is this issue of needing to offset my.	O
My file a little bit every so often.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Like.	CHITCHAT
Filter other offset.	O
Like that I need to do that for the whales to an this the way it is now like this is the way it should be.	O

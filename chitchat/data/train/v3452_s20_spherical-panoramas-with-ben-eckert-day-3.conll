Had a bit of an issue, there.	CHITCHAT
And if I want to offset it normally would have for every single layer so I've got to come up with a way to make it not operate like that.	O
And there is the slight problem here.	CHITCHAT
I say slights pretty considerable problem of the blend modes.	O
Acting differently.	O
When merged so I'm going to hide everything.	O
And I'm going to again I'm not going to duplicate it.	O
But I am going to do a new empty layer and hold control.	O
Alt shift and E and that will.	O
Not quite not quite do what I want.	O
What that does it flattens everything as it is visibly into one singular layer but even still didn't quite get the?	O
Get the thing that I wanted out of that.	O
Me.	CHITCHAT
See if the background, you know, maybe it did work.	O
Let me let me try that once more.	O
And then undo all that.	O
Turn the background on now you can still see that we've got this weird is weird effect being caused.	O
So maybe I'll just have to.	CHITCHAT
I have an idea of how to deal with that I can just continue to work.	O
As if it's not a problem and then at the very end.	O
I can just flatten everything visually.	O
So this is probably going to be OK.	O
I suppose, but kind of sketch back on.	O
I want to take my background.	O
And then To know the background is fine as it is not going to happen to the boat and will just get this going now.	O
So I want to get some good colors for this guy.	CHITCHAT
I'm not really sure I've been thinking of like a weird sort of military green color.	O
For this, but I don't really know if I want to actually go with that.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Michael with like a nice imagining a speedboat now in some ways that I kind of think that eh.	O
Like a white, red and black combo might not might not be a bad idea.	O
But something about blue would be a good compliment to the Sky.	O
So I might go with like a bit of a bluish whitish look.	O
Let's give that a try.	CHITCHAT
Is that?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let me just make a nice.	O
Knockout layer for the boat here.	O
Hey, you know what let me actually redo the line art for this guy to.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to at some point in the future anyway.	CHITCHAT
So I might as well do it now, just tighten up the line art make a little bit more.	O
Queen.	O
And I've got just the tool for this so with the 2020 addition at least it might have been even more later than that, but they've introduced the symmetry tool.	O
And it's really handy up to this point what I've been doing is drawing half of my illustration and then duplicating it and flipping it for good symmetry, but that's annoying to do so.	O
Luckily, now we have this beautiful symmetry tool.	O
Which I think will be greatly useful and I'm just going to draw the boat again like this and I might even.	O
I don't want to move my sketch, but I might.	CHITCHAT
'Cause as it is right now, the steering wheel isn't quite lined up and I don't know if I want to move the.	O
Turn off Phone with a sketch or my symmetry plane.	O
I don't know if there would be any downsides just moving the sketch, but it might throw up the whole thing and I don't want to do that.	O
Alright let's just move.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I want the string would look nice.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I can execute like a good a good looking steering wheel.	CHITCHAT
Free hand.	CHITCHAT
It's alright it's OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go ahead and like.	O
Draw these little like I don't know spokey bits, but I'm going to rotate it later.	O
Not gonna worry.	CHITCHAT

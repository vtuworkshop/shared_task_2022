I like to say this.	CHITCHAT
I like to say.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to worry too much about the line art even though I am an even though I would like it to look good, I still just say like Oh yeah, we don't worry about it, too much.	CHITCHAT
It's it's fine.	CHITCHAT
While inwardly I'm saying I'm doing the best I can.	CHITCHAT
Please.	CHITCHAT
Please have mercy on me.	CHITCHAT
Please please don't make fun of my lousy line, art for those.	CHITCHAT
If you're not terribly good at doing the symmetry tool you can get some stuff that looks a little bit weird.	CHITCHAT
So the tried not to do that, if I can help with.	CHITCHAT
We've still got our base grid over Top of all this.	O
Which makes it really easy to fix my perspective issues so I've got this line going like this?	O
But it really should go like this.	O
In between these 2 lines here here.	O
That's a handy little cleanup.	O
That I can do.	O
The same thing here as well, just follow those lines the lines the guidelines will not.	O
Will not abandoned you will always be there and helping out?	O
We've got these lines here as well that we can use to match the curvature.	O
That.	CHITCHAT
And This is why I wanted to redo the line art for all of this because.	O
The old stuff was a little bit rushed a little bit weird, not really ideal so will just fix it.	O
We want to follow these lines now to match for the door.	O
So we've got.	CHITCHAT
I think this one here.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit weird as we approach the horizon line.	O
They get a bit of a mess of perspective grid.	O
So I'm going to try to make it look a little bit cleaner.	O
We've got about 15 minutes left.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do about 10 minutes and then I'm going to show off some of the older stuff that we did up to this point and I'd like to go and look at some other artists on the hands and really give some appreciation out to those people too.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if anybody else is live right now.	CHITCHAT
I can take a peek and I can redirect you guys over to them.	CHITCHAT
I've seen lots of people trying out the new fresco app.	CHITCHAT
I think it's only on the I think it's only an iPad actually fresco it might be available on.	CHITCHAT
Like Android, but I'm not entirely sure.	CHITCHAT
I'd love to get an Android tablet and use as a portable like sketching tool.	CHITCHAT
But I don't have.	CHITCHAT
Anything like that at the moment.	CHITCHAT
And I don't really want to draw on my Phone.	CHITCHAT
I've tried it before I downloaded the photo shop app on my Phone.	CHITCHAT
And my Phone is just it's a large Phone, but it's still just a little bit too.	CHITCHAT
Too small for that kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
Just cramps my hand a lot.	CHITCHAT
And it's not very comfortable.	CHITCHAT
But I know a lot of people who work exclusively on like an iPad or something like that.	CHITCHAT
And that seems like a really cool handy tool to have.	CHITCHAT
My cough is been getting better, but it's still there.	CHITCHAT
Still, very annoying.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I think it costs like that, although I can't really remember last winter very well.	CHITCHAT
Nothing really stands out about it, I don't remember if I got sick or not during that time.	CHITCHAT
I feel like my immune system is been getting worse as I get older, too, which is you know like how things work but.	CHITCHAT
It's becoming a bit alarming actually a little bit little bit alarming.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT

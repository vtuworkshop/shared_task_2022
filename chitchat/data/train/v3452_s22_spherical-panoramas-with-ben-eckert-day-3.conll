We've for the most part.	CHITCHAT
Got that sorted out.	CHITCHAT
OK let me turn off my symmetry tool now.	O
I wanted to get mostly just the foundation of the boat done with that.	O
I want this to look like a helmet of some sort but I'm not very creative when it comes to stuff like this.	O
So just drop in.	O
Oh jeez just dropping some shapes that look kinda cool.	CHITCHAT
I want to look like a kind of cool helmet, but not like uncharacteristic of the environment.	O
That makes sense.	CHITCHAT
Like I feel like having these weird like?	CHITCHAT
Air filtration bits, they make sense, but they look a little bit spooky, you know, kind of spooky look to it.	CHITCHAT
Kind of sinister almost.	CHITCHAT
Um Lenardo, thank you for the following work.	CHITCHAT
Omneya.	CHITCHAT
And Bree as well.	CHITCHAT
Thank you guys all for the follows appreciate you greatly.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to get A at least like some base colors in for this ship this boat.	O
Before I in the stream so I might do some compromises on the line art just to get that sorted out.	CHITCHAT
I've got about 10 minutes left so I want to get this done reasonably fast.	CHITCHAT
OK, that looks fun enough.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to add some nice nice line art, though, and I don't really feel like I get the chance.	CHITCHAT
Gotta couple like knobs and dials and switches and levers.	CHITCHAT
And hope that it looks good in perspective.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it will or not, but.	CHITCHAT
It's alright.	CHITCHAT
I'd like a little like lever here.	O
I don't want to compromise, the whole piece just for the sake of drawing in some stuff, so let me clean it up a little bit there, we go.	O
I want to rotate the steering wheel as well so it doesn't look so.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Symmetrical like that.	O
Adding like some nice.	O
Implications of reflection.	O
That I want to add some more blocked in Shadows, too because locked in shadows are really good for adding like an artificial sense depth.	O
So will do some of that might even like draw a slight outline around those boots there.	O
It's like that an instead of doing a full.	O
Black I want some cross hatching too.	O
Just for some visual interest, I guess.	CHITCHAT
And then I also want to block that out there.	O
And then on the opposite side will do the same thing just like that.	O
OK looking good looking good so far, so we've got a pretty tight.	CHITCHAT
Sketch now bring out.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to sound panicked.	CHITCHAT
I'm not panicking.	CHITCHAT
I'm just I'm just in a little bit of a rush to get this looking alright.	CHITCHAT
Just like that, the faster I talked the more stressed out.	CHITCHAT
I imagine it makes his feel.	CHITCHAT
Like a small?	CHITCHAT
Couple of like containers here, maybe even add like a couple of panels up there just for some for some visual interest.	O

You know like a little bit cooler and now I'm going to do a layer below this and I'm going to just start blocking in so my blue or values, so turn sample all layers on and then turn my tolerance up a little bit more just start filling these areas and then I'll tighten it up later.	O
Not really sure if I like that particular blue, though, so let me just grab all that.	O
Darker how we feeling.	O
A little bit more like metal.	O
Not bad?	CHITCHAT
OK, I imagine like a bit of a darker seat.	O
I imagined a green for awhile there play on that idea.	O
We're still back a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna get maybe like some white for the consoles up here.	O
Maybe not a bad idea.	CHITCHAT
White and black.	O
Aren't the bad combo?	O
Some fairly dark boots, I don't know if I wanna go for like this blue or not.	O
Blueish grey that's fine.	O
Like that.	CHITCHAT
And this helmet, I think I want to make it like a little bit more in the white area and give it may be a?	O
I don't know how 'bout just like a nice kind of chill blue for like this rim edge.	O
Then maybe like a bit of a black good for this filter here.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT
And this is a little bit dumb considering my timer strains, but I'm going to do this make it.	CHITCHAT
At the face visor here grab all the Sky and reflect it back.	O
I hope that's the implication that it's reflecting all that even put like isoft highlight along the side here, too.	O
Just like that.	CHITCHAT
That's not too bad I get a nice dark console here.	O
I'll make the steering wheel, Red House that's sad because, like a red steering wheel.	O
Yeah, not like this just like a silver just a quick.	O
Quicksilver, like that a couple of darker bits across there may be having like a nice bright red lever there.	O
And then I gotta do the sides of here still.	O
Get all that looking good to East doors up.	CHITCHAT
The good news is we've had 0 crashes.	CHITCHAT
I'm pretty sure the audio is working.	CHITCHAT
Alright well, yeah, I guess breeded reply to what I said, so yeah, audio is working.	CHITCHAT
We've got no crashes made a lot of progress.	CHITCHAT
Today, feeling very good about the whole thing.	CHITCHAT
I was hesitant to set up my other PC for the streaming purposes.	CHITCHAT
But it's turning out to be a really good decision.	CHITCHAT
And while it does involve a little bit of extra legwork.	CHITCHAT
It ends up being worth it in the end for sure.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Do I want to just call it there and will just.	CHITCHAT
Just take a little people, but we got.	CHITCHAT
I think so.	CHITCHAT
It's not like I'm.	CHITCHAT
Legally obligated to never go above my 2 hour period so.	CHITCHAT

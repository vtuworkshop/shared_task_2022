Probably just Finish this up a little bit.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
And then what will do what I want to do in just a second.	CHITCHAT
I wanna make this like a darker.	O
Start.	O
I'll go ahead and make that.	CHITCHAT
Although I wanted to look like like this kind of metal actually.	O
Or maybe the string with metal like that.	O
Alright not too bad there.	O
Um, I'll just leave the little dividers for the door.	O
The way they are that's probably OK.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
You know what let's just do a quick a quick multiply layer for the shadow here just like that.	O
Like this.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I've got a good feeling about this one spring.	CHITCHAT
The whales back in there, a little in the way aren't they will fix that.	O
OK.	O
Since I did the shadows might as well.	O
Do the highlights as well.	O
It's a never ending cycle of addition and Subtraction and trying to make things look better try to make him look less bad.	CHITCHAT
It's a forever game that we play.	CHITCHAT
There's going to be a bit of an obvious seem I think when it comes to this chair, but it shouldn't be too big a deal.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Kay.	CHITCHAT
So let's just merge all these together.	O
After duplicating actually let's duplicate him emerge am will hide all these and.	O
What I'm going to do is actually flip it and I might as well fix it?	O
I can it's right there.	O
No big deal perfect.	CHITCHAT
There fixed.	O
Although.	CHITCHAT
Just do that easy solved.	CHITCHAT
So the whales are like that, too, and the whole background is as well.	O
So it's better to make this layer.	O
A little weird instead.	O
I think what I'd like to do is.	CHITCHAT
Let's apply a look up table.	O
A color look up.	O
And see if we can get a nice.	CHITCHAT
Nice look.	CHITCHAT
Are they all here?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it looks pretty nice OK.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I think the whole thing is backwards.	O
So I'm going to make a new layer here and then put everything into that layer and then flip it whoops.	O
I applied my blur by accident, were going to invert it offset it that's right.	O
There we go.	O
And we're going to have a weird looking son, but I think that's probably OK.	O
The whales are in the way let me crop.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait.	CHITCHAT

I've jumped the gun.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
This layer needs to be set to like overlay.	O
OK.	O
Now we can copy this and flatten it.	O
So now we have our boat.	O
OK.	O
I'll put that up here.	O
Next up?	CHITCHAT
We want to get the whales in the background, So what I think I'll do here is actually.	O
Yeah, well combine the whales an will combine the background into this layer.	O
So now we have our two elements here we've got our boat.	O
And we've got our whales in background here.	O
So the first thing we need to do is.	O
Make our whales correct.	O
The boats in front where it should be.	O
And now we can combine these guys together.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
That's a bit annoying I'm sure that's fine, though actually let me just.	CHITCHAT
Step back a little bit.	CHITCHAT
That's not working.	O
How to airbrush?	O
Smooth that out, a little bit.	O
They all play a no that's not going to work here.	O
It's going to play my noise blur filter, but that's not really what I want for this so now we have both of our elements put together as they should be.	O
and I will do a let's just do a huge set kind of bus things up a little bit.	O
Make a little bit more visually interesting.	O
A little bit darker in some spots little bit brighter there.	O
Just do some just do some color correction.	O
Bring up a little bit of the contrast a bit is that a bit too much maybe a bit too much there.	O
And then over all of this, I want to have a color look up.	O
And I will choose something looks nice to strip does not work.	O
None of these are working actually very well.	O
Only combine all these together.	O
I don't think any of these are going to be what I want.	O
That was not too bad and it's a little bit overexposed, though, isn't it.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
You can't really just grab a color.	O
Look up table and expected to work, though a lot of times so this one looks OK.	O
I'll go with it.	O
I'll flatten these again and do window about 3D Spherical, Panorama, an new from selected layers and this will be our finished product for today.	O
At least I think it's a work.	CHITCHAT
Alright isn't it properties.	CHITCHAT
Where is it?	CHITCHAT
OK, you know what you win going back to the 3D view.	O
There we go.	O
Will drop the field of view down to like?	O
3 three is probably fine.	O
2 is OK as well.	O
I suppose and will hide our windows and go into full screen and then fit to screen and there, you have it fellas.	O
This is our little boats.	O
A little a little crusty here and there, but overall, it's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
Obviously, it needs.	O
Some fixes and I will learn overtime.	O
What doesn't doesn't work for things like this, but I think it's pretty cool.	CHITCHAT
I think it's not too bad for the most part.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
The lens flares.	O
Not really the best are they good.	O
We got a nice high res.	O
Panorama painting here.	O
Obviously spending some more time on the composition.	CHITCHAT
I could be cool.	CHITCHAT
If you could see the distance, a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
The whales need some work.	O
There's lots of issues here and there, but overall, I think it's kinda nice thing you can grab this guy downloaded as a PNG pop this into your VR tool of your choice on your Phone or your PC for example, you can open this up as a 360 image in virtual desktop and you can actually view it in real time I did that before I don't want to do it now 'cause it takes a little bit of setting up.	O

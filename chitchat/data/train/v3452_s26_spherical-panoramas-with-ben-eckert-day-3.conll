But yeah, I think it's I think it's working alright.	O
Look and you see how skewed the helmet was initially it looks a little bit better.	O
Now doesn't.	O
It little as weird now, but I think this is super cool.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how you go about like animating this because really an animation is just a series of pictures.	CHITCHAT
It sounds like a nightmare, trying to render out like you know 1000 different still frames of 360 imagery.	CHITCHAT
That sounds like a lot to to work with, but yeah, I think this is kind of neat, it's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
Kind of gives you an idea of what you can expect here.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it could take a little bit more work to get you can see the.	CHITCHAT
Even though my lines are pretty clean on the.	O
On the sketch, they do work, a little bit on the tops and bottoms.	O
So something else.	CHITCHAT
You have to figure out but overall feeling pretty good about it, I'll just.	CHITCHAT
Save this.	O
As the whale Sky.	O
Color 360 just to show that that's 360 version and let's just back out of this a little bit.	O
I'm going to take a look at some of my other.	O
360 panels up to this point.	O
We've got.	CHITCHAT
The very first one, I did.	CHITCHAT
Is I think?	CHITCHAT
This one here, the Christmas scene this one was pretty rough.	CHITCHAT
Let me close this for fear of crashing my computer.	CHITCHAT
I won't save.	CHITCHAT
Those changes, though this was the first one, I did all inside of the actual not.	CHITCHAT
Thank you is that correct on yet.	CHITCHAT
This was the very first one, I did, and you can see.	O
I've already made a significant progress towards improving my work.	O
We added some color correction layers on Top to make it look a little bit more interesting.	O
But this was the first night done.	CHITCHAT
I did this all inside the photo spirit self.	CHITCHAT
So I had like a limited layer selection that I could actually use but it does help to kind of keep yourself grounded.	O
I didn't actually use any of my perspective tools for this of which I have 3 now for different types of 360 environments.	O
This was all done inside and I can actually share the export with you guys here of what it looks like stretched out.	O
A little bit weird, kind of kind of crusty right.	CHITCHAT
And it ended up having a lot of issues like all of the transparents where they were preserved in the final version, which ended up being really weird in the headset.	O
All the transparency bits for put out as just black spaces, which was kind of gross.	O
This was the 2nd one that I had done.	O
I had a little bit more knowledge.	O
At that point in time.	O
So we're using this horizon grid, which I will have included in my total collection.	O
Once I've finished up all my different panel spheres.	CHITCHAT
I'll put them in one project on my Behance page.	CHITCHAT
And I'll have included all the different horizons and stuff that I've got for the grids.	CHITCHAT
So this was a sketch inside of the photo sphere, which end up becoming.	O
This image here.	O
I ended up painting it will take a look at this very quickly in the.	O
Panosphere view.	O
Just take a look around.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of cool, not the best not the worst.	CHITCHAT
You got the same issue of the clouds, having a hard time up there that have a shame.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think this is kind of cool and nice cell shaded look works really good for this.	CHITCHAT
Look works really nicely.	CHITCHAT
And then I also had a third somewhere, I don't know if I saved it, though I hope I did.	CHITCHAT
Why do they put that?	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Is just a cute little video game type look and you can even see the HUD that I have overlaid right here to make it feel like a little game.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what the potential is for something like this, but I think it's pretty pretty huge, huge impossibility and hopefully scope as well.	CHITCHAT
Um just open this field of you up a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
So those are the four we've done so far.	CHITCHAT
We've got the Christmas scene.	CHITCHAT
We've got this.	CHITCHAT
Waterfall Canyon scene.	CHITCHAT
We've got this role playing game type environment.	CHITCHAT
And finally once I close all these down, I won't save any of those things.	CHITCHAT
No thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hope.	CHITCHAT
And out of that, too.	CHITCHAT
And finally we have our whale Sky.	CHITCHAT
Boat scenario here, too, which is leaps and bounds better already than everything up to this point but that's what happens when you spend a bit more time on something it tends to get a bit better, so this could even be pushed even further, and I've seen people make some really, really cool.	CHITCHAT

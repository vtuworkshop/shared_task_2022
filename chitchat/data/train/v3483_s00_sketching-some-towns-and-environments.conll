Hello Hi, How you guys doing?	CHITCHAT
And we got a little bit of door showing let me just fix this real quick right there.	CHITCHAT
Hello, how you guys doing today?	CHITCHAT
We're going to be this is the correct.	CHITCHAT
Hold on.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't sure if my Spotify overly was updating or not.	CHITCHAT
Today is gonna be pretty casual.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna be doing some sketches.	O
I've got nothing on hand at the minute but I've got some inspiration in mind.	CHITCHAT
For what I want to do.	CHITCHAT
Going.	CHITCHAT
I would have liked to get some like.	CHITCHAT
More up references but you know what this is going to be totally fine.	CHITCHAT
I was dealing with the slight issue of having limited bandwidth.	CHITCHAT
So I was more hesitant to stream more often.	CHITCHAT
But we've got that sorted out, no more no more data caps for this month at least.	CHITCHAT
And hopefully for the future but.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, we're going to go on for about.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to aim for around 2 hours today.	CHITCHAT
Michaels do 2 hours tonight and then tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I'll do 2 more hours probably either either Saturday or Sunday.	CHITCHAT
I'll do 2 more hours.	CHITCHAT
I do have some streaming on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to do at some point, so I'm gonna have to give you my time up as well as giving myself some personal times as well.	CHITCHAT
This is going to be clearly so far fairly different than the value paintings so far.	O
This is probably going to be uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I have any other comparisons to like put this into a Category 4.	CHITCHAT
This is going to be kind of like another sketchy thing.	O
It gets a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Uh you know, I'm not taking any classes.	CHITCHAT
I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I'm not in the mindset of like repetition and study.	CHITCHAT
It's not really where I tend to put myself so doing like Day 1234.	CHITCHAT
I think we got up to.	CHITCHAT
I think it was just 4 might have gotten to 5.	CHITCHAT
For value studies it just it takes a long time to get better and I'm totally fine with taking my time with that.	CHITCHAT
I'm fine with just like every so often will do a study and will just get better overtime, but doing like the same type of study day after day kind of wears me down a bit and it doesn't really.	CHITCHAT
I don't know inspire me doesn't make me feel like I'm actually getting any better, so I like to change things up every so often, and today we're going to do some environments.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to in my mind compose a scene.	O
I'm envisioning right now.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to like duplicate this image that I that I saw earlier, but it's.	O
Basically, a city on like Aspire, not like aspire like on the edge of a Cliff.	O
I don't want to copy that image directly because it's just somebody else's work.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
But I'd like to work in that in that direction of like fairly loose line art with a good composition an interesting concept.	O

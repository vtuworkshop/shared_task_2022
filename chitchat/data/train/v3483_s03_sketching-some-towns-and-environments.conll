Maybe the people who live here have like flattened out.	O
A little bit.	O
And then Double back.	O
Now I don't know how like Obviously, the safety aspect of living in a place like this would be especially not exist like you would be risking your life every day.	CHITCHAT
When you exit your house.	CHITCHAT
He's not fall off this Cliff with that and I don't know if I want to like.	CHITCHAT
Text.	O
Maybe I could put like a little little.	O
I kind of like that.	CHITCHAT
Actually, having like it's it's a bit.	CHITCHAT
Ironic isn't it having like a guardrail.	CHITCHAT
Here, like if people are going to live in this sort of environment.	CHITCHAT
That means that they're willing to take those risks and then to have the guardrail there.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of fun in some ways.	CHITCHAT
I think I like.	CHITCHAT
You would have to get like all of your food imported.	CHITCHAT
There's no way you'd be able to get.	CHITCHAT
Like Gardens, everything up here like maybe you could get like a little greenhouse in your in your window.	CHITCHAT
When you get a lot of sunlight.	CHITCHAT

Imagine the Chiefs House would you like that very Top it's a bit weird the chief is usually the oldest member of the society?	CHITCHAT
Let me bring this little bit closer and to imagine some old man, having to make this hike, all the way up.	O
This mountain every time he wants to go home.	CHITCHAT
It seems a little unrealistic.	CHITCHAT
So maybe the Chiefs proposed the following.	CHITCHAT
These are all things you have to think about you know if you want to have good worldbuilding like kind of what I'm trying here.	O
You gotta think about the logistics of if you want it to be convinced.	O
Grass here.	O
Maybe even like a small tree.	O
Not too big that's a little bit too.	O
Big I think I'm making my scale little bit little bit to exaggerate.	O
That's probably not.	O
I think I want this to have a split and I'll have it come down this way.	O
This.	CHITCHAT
Just to access it at 4 houses down here.	O
Look like that.	O
Maybe even One more split off this way.	O
And it'll just come down like that.	O
So we've got room for maybe a house here.	O
And then maybe even one like this split off.	O
I have this one here as well.	O
Those are just rough indications that to where I want to be.	O
I've got a nice Patty is there.	CHITCHAT

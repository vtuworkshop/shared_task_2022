I'm not certain if I aimed to.	O
Color this in after I'm thinking like a very light watercolor wash might be in order but.	O
Sure, how much do.	CHITCHAT
There's the tree can't forget the tree.	O
Was that a little bit more stone here?	CHITCHAT
There is one thing I definitely wanted to get the grass on may be there.	O
But I I guess.	CHITCHAT
Select these hanging vines will be good.	O
I think that's meant to be rock back there.	O
Grass.	O
Oh my wrist.	CHITCHAT
I've got to quit using such short motions, with my my end.	CHITCHAT
It's going to give my wrists and problems.	CHITCHAT
You know, I kind of like the idea of.	CHITCHAT
I was a bit on the fence about this for this Top building.	CHITCHAT
I had in mind.	CHITCHAT
22 major things so I want these guys to be fairly modern so they have like, you know.	O
Automatic lights and like maybe maybe those blinds.	O
You know the blinds that you can get like a fancy hotel where you push a button and they open and close?	CHITCHAT
Like shutter blinds.	O
I like that kind of thing, but also I kinda want the.	O
I want this building on Top to either be like a nice like modern polished white.	O
Or like a red brick as if it's been there for awhile and they upgraded it like maybe they've they've taken over like this old lighthouse.	O
And they just made the lighthouse that was there.	O
A modern wind powered generators for their little little little facility.	O
Village kind of like that idea.	CHITCHAT
I think I like this quite a bit already.	CHITCHAT
I'll give him some like.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I kind of thought sandstone stairs might be.	CHITCHAT
I think I do like that I do quite a bit.	CHITCHAT
I think like I think like a nice sort of pristine white might not be bad, something really modern how my wrist again.	CHITCHAT
I'm like putting pressure right there.	CHITCHAT
When I when I scratch.	CHITCHAT
My neck that is that's not normal I should consult a physician about that.	CHITCHAT
My whole body actually kind of hurts now that I think about it.	CHITCHAT
I was feeling kinda lousy earlier.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's just the weather or something else.	CHITCHAT
But having a painful wrist does not work well with the Dreamliner.	CHITCHAT
It reads nicely, even without the color, which is pretty important.	O

Which of these Kyle brushes do I want to use?	O
That one's not bad?	O
I might make my.	O
My DPI little bit higher, though.	O
Because the smaller you get.	O
Resolution.	O
Make it 100 pixels per inch.	O
No, I don't plan to make this detail like really newly.	CHITCHAT
I don't plan to get in there.	CHITCHAT
To make the details real tight, but I would like to make sure that.	O
The lines are crisp.	O
Like this.	O
I've had an interesting idea is it appear I have, I have a pro track.	CHITCHAT
And it's a little bit weird to use I mean, it's weird to me, but to use a protractor.	CHITCHAT
On a graphics tablet is that is that weird or is that just me and my the one that's making it.	CHITCHAT
Now there is a slight problem with that idea and that slight problem is that there's a little bit of deviance between the tip of my brush and where the display thinks that tip the brushes.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit of a in congruence there for example, I've got my protractor right now right along the very edge of of this year.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'll put it right along that side.	CHITCHAT
As I draw it's pretty accurate is and it's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
But it's different throughout the screen, so in some areas that might not be quite that accurate.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to use this project.	CHITCHAT
It's weird isn't it?	CHITCHAT
Is it just me?	CHITCHAT
I think that's really weird?	CHITCHAT
It looks very bad, though it would take some getting used to, I suppose but.	CHITCHAT
Hold on let me get my different.	CHITCHAT
Gotta couple.	CHITCHAT
Just put this up here.	CHITCHAT
All.	CHITCHAT
Autumn Mesa.	CHITCHAT
An absolute mess AM.	CHITCHAT
I need to get like a better mix.	O
Like I could just use the tools that photo shop has but for some reason I want to try this out today.	O
I want to try this out.	CHITCHAT
All right, so this is a compass many of you are probably familiar with what this is it's basically a.	O
Attract it's a It's a ruler on a track that has a circle and you can basically make a circle really nicely with it.	O
So I'll push this part against the screen, and I'll put my well.	O
Yeah, it kind of fits I'll put the pen in there and then you can spin it freely, so if I put.	O
Well actually this has a couple of smaller rings inside of it and what these do is you can just do that no problem.	O
So what I'm going to do for the inside of this is just do that.	O
It's a bit weird isn't it not sure if I'm all about that or not, but it makes it look a bit more authentic.	CHITCHAT
I guess you know you get the imperfections that you have with a pencil.	O
I kind of like that aspect of it.	O
Add a Here.	O
I got this idea by watching somebody doing a calibration of their pen tablet and they just compared the line on the ruler and.	CHITCHAT

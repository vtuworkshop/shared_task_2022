For whatever reason that struck me as I should do that.	CHITCHAT
Normally, I should I should use it as a tool that I would often use.	CHITCHAT
Kind of fun you just you can't really do that with the non graphics tablet, though, you know.	CHITCHAT
And it's a little bit faster, I guess then.	CHITCHAT
Getting the Never out.	CHITCHAT
Gone for the weekend.	CHITCHAT
Dumb.	CHITCHAT
Earth stone.	CHITCHAT
Not quite as precise, though.	CHITCHAT
In the City Park Dolphins in Madrid.	CHITCHAT
Wonder if it's any faster than just like manually drawing is out.	CHITCHAT
A little bit more accurate.	O
So.	O
Little weird.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Imagining a little bit of A.	O
Like a sheet metal roof maybe.	O
Although that doesn't seem like it's.	O
Very in line with the.	O
Modern look maybe it's not a big deal.	O
That's reasonably quick for some good definitely straight lines right like if I did it by hand.	O
I'd probably have to do it a couple of times to get one, I like.	O
Z.	CHITCHAT
Do you agree?	CHITCHAT
Baby.	CHITCHAT
See.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what?	CHITCHAT
A.	CHITCHAT
What are these called?	CHITCHAT
What is the actual name for this?	CHITCHAT
It's like not a window but I guess it kind of is a window?	CHITCHAT
I don't know like what the technical needs of this would be so I guess like the propeller.	CHITCHAT
Here's a quick.	CHITCHAT
Here's a quick lesson So what happens?	CHITCHAT
Is there's what is that a solenoid a copper copper spool and I think it's I don't remember if it's meant to surround a metallic rod but whatever the situation is.	CHITCHAT
The fan blade is hooked up like that.	CHITCHAT
That's a fan not a flower and as this will actually.	CHITCHAT
As the spins.	CHITCHAT
It rotates this.	CHITCHAT
And this is copper, it's accomplished solenoid.	CHITCHAT
I think this is what the name is for that and as this rotates it generates a magnetic force and that's what produces electricity so all you really need is the copper motor the propellers to spin.	CHITCHAT
And some wired it.	CHITCHAT
Kerry that to a battery that's really all it needs.	CHITCHAT
So I don't really think that these need to have too many cool details.	O
Coming off but like we got like I was thinking, I could have here.	O
The Little School in the back and then maybe the wire would come down like that.	O
And you can get things like like cogs to turn rotational energy into Spindle Energi.	O
And I think that's done with like.	CHITCHAT
If you can imagine.	CHITCHAT
This is just this is me, breaking up my drawing process a little bit, I think.	CHITCHAT
So what happens is you have rotation.	CHITCHAT

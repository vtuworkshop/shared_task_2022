And I don't know how that would work.	CHITCHAT
Let me think about that for a second.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of fascinating right Oh if you were to have.	CHITCHAT
Acog.	CHITCHAT
Imagine this in 3 dimensions.	O
This is meant to be an art stream and I can barely draw this.	CHITCHAT
Will do like a side view on a front?	O
View OK so this is a cog here.	O
And as this spins the cog spins as well.	O
And then what you can do is you can have that cog than Interlink with a different card.	O
Or you can have your?	CHITCHAT
You can have your card I think.	CHITCHAT
You can make you can maybe do this, where it's like an asymmetrical joint which causes the cog to wobble and make an ellipse and then you can have that with Leica Leica pump.	CHITCHAT
Which would make it go like a train track it would go up and down so there's lots of ways you can like extend your Spindle Enerji, but I think the most efficient way like every time you add a step like that.	CHITCHAT
Every time there's a cog that has to spin or a spindle that has to pump or a or a I don't know anything else, it reduces the total kinetic energy right.	CHITCHAT
Which means it will be a lossy conversion so it's really good to have like a solid tight solenoid where the energy is created in the 1st place.	CHITCHAT
And that's it can kind of like it.	CHITCHAT
You don't have to know all that stuff to make the concept art.	CHITCHAT
But if you know about like how it's meant to work.	CHITCHAT
It makes it feel a little bit more convincing.	CHITCHAT
I suppose and like I think a lot of times.	CHITCHAT
Like new fantasy stories just for like yeah, it's just magic will make our own our own logic for it.	CHITCHAT
That way we don't have to worry about actually knowing how stuff works because you make it up, which is fine.	CHITCHAT
There's nothing wrong with that late if you're an artist.	CHITCHAT
Strictly and you don't care about science like why should you be bottlenecked by.	CHITCHAT
But I think people respect if you if you do your research you know.	CHITCHAT
That's why I think people like.	CHITCHAT
Is that movie called with the?	CHITCHAT
With the Matt Damon, It was the adaptation of that one book.	CHITCHAT
Does anybody remember?	CHITCHAT
Matt Damon Mars movie.	CHITCHAT
Well, the author for that book I think he did a lot of research.	CHITCHAT
You have to, if you want to have like an actual realistic survival story.	CHITCHAT
Got it.	CHITCHAT
Did?	CHITCHAT
It was grounded.	CHITCHAT
What's that movie called can anybody remember that movie name?	CHITCHAT
If anyone's watching.	CHITCHAT
It's driving me crazy.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to look it up and streaming service.	CHITCHAT
I wanna see what it was called surviving Mars, but that's a game.	CHITCHAT
Not a That is a pretty nice movie, though I should watch it again.	CHITCHAT
I don't know how good the re watchability is though.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the Martian that's what it was thank you.	CHITCHAT
It's so obvious.	CHITCHAT
But so obvious when you when you when you know what it is.	CHITCHAT
The Martian on Mars, thank you Stephanie.	CHITCHAT
Crazy the book was the same name right the Martian.	CHITCHAT
And you warm.	CHITCHAT
He's a pretty good sci-fi writer right.	CHITCHAT
Oh my What's that?	CHITCHAT
How does that work just like having it on the tip of your tongue like that must have some like brain thing going on right.	CHITCHAT
Like.	CHITCHAT
Neurons.	CHITCHAT
Memories.	CHITCHAT
Just coming along Alright.	CHITCHAT

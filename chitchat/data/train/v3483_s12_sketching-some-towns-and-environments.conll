I'm really aiming for.	CHITCHAT
Anything like individually technically good, I think like overall, it'll look I'm gonna look OK.	O
So if the steps aren't quite in perspective or the hand rails don't quite line up.	O
I don't think it's that big if you think it's probably OK and really like I'm doing this for myself so.	CHITCHAT
I think it looks fine that's all that really matters.	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking to myself, This is like too much detail already but you know, I I want to make this netting as well like.	O
Kind of drawn out, too so.	CHITCHAT
Do you still work doesn't need to be?	CHITCHAT
I'll keep it loose.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT
And here like this metal band around the.	O
This rock.	O
As if as if these people could.	CHITCHAT
I'll get all the rocky to get details.	O
In later I'm not going to worry about those right now.	O
But if you want to get this on.	O
I don't often do shadows like this anymore.	O
It's kind of nice.	O
Doing my shooting by hand, I do lots of screen tones.	O
Or, a greedy.	CHITCHAT
I've seen some news recently about the guy who I guess first started the inktober trend hashtag.	CHITCHAT
And he is trying to make a book.	CHITCHAT
I don't know like what the context of the book is but I think it's inktober related.	CHITCHAT
And what he allegedly is going to do.	CHITCHAT
I don't know the details but he wants to Copyright the ink tober.	CHITCHAT
Word like the wording told it wants to make that a copyrighted phrase.	CHITCHAT
And dumb.	CHITCHAT
I guess by extension, if people I don't know like why anybody would or if people have been selling their inktober sketchbooks and labeling as an inktober sketchbook.	CHITCHAT
They could be at a they could have a hard time.	CHITCHAT
Legally doing that.	CHITCHAT
So you won't be able to sell anything that's labeled Inktober Copyright.	CHITCHAT
And it's got a lot of people pretty worked up now.	CHITCHAT
I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I'm not the kind of person who gets too involved and things like that.	CHITCHAT
Using it as a marketing tool as a as an artist yourself.	CHITCHAT
It's really good because you can have an excuse to like spam your stuff as much as you can.	CHITCHAT
And the more people that can see your trending topics the better right.	CHITCHAT
As artists were usually in a pretty awkward situation financially so the more eyes.	CHITCHAT
We can get on our stuff, the better and.	CHITCHAT
If using someones hashtag.	CHITCHAT
Gets you that.	CHITCHAT
That's that's really handy so I'm wondering how that's going to play out.	CHITCHAT

And how if that's going to be a big deal next year.	CHITCHAT
At least like this issue is being done.	CHITCHAT
After this years inktober, though right imagine if like the week before.	CHITCHAT
October starts here by the way guys you can't use my my hashtag anymore.	CHITCHAT
'cause if you don't want to Sue you.	CHITCHAT
When you coming home, but it's it's a It's a mixed bag for me personally because I I see that if somebody makes something if they come up with the concept.	CHITCHAT
Anet celebrated and used by a lot of people, you should probably try to monetize that but on the other hand, it's just like.	CHITCHAT
What if somebody tried to like Copyright the phrase like marathon or bar crawl it's just an event you know?	CHITCHAT
Why does inktober differently?	CHITCHAT
My baby allegedly those Copyright went through his request for the Copyright so.	CHITCHAT
Yes, it's all on board, but I don't know, man like I think it's equally stupid too.	CHITCHAT
To follow through with that idea so like that, as an idea, it's totally fine.	CHITCHAT
I guess you know if he did come up with it and you want to monetize it.	CHITCHAT
Sure, but you're basically putting out like a whole community of people.	CHITCHAT
Those people.	CHITCHAT
Which are your audience he's making this book I think right and he wants to sell that book to people who appreciate art, and usually the people that appreciate at the most make it too.	CHITCHAT
So I feel like that's a really good way of.	CHITCHAT
Of.	CHITCHAT
Attacking or demographic and that is a bad and that is not monetizing that's the opposite of monetizing in a lot of cases, he probably would have made more money just doing what he was doing anyways.	CHITCHAT
And not possible that one of the Copyright stuff and it's honestly probably like.	CHITCHAT
Not even his idea, he was probably advised by a publisher to do that.	CHITCHAT
It seems like something that's published.	CHITCHAT
So he's probably not entirely to blame for the whole debacle.	CHITCHAT
Might be.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah that's a bit of a different story.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Do you have a link to that stream by chance with it on Twitter here on Behance or somewhere else?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's still a bit awkward, though, isn't it.	CHITCHAT
There's always like one person has to ruin it for everybody right.	CHITCHAT
Like if people can sell someone else designs.	CHITCHAT
You can bet.	CHITCHAT
Like me for example, I'm not a huge artist.	CHITCHAT
I'm not I don't have a large following.	CHITCHAT
I don't have like, I don't make a living off my art.	CHITCHAT
But I did have like 1 design, I was really proud of and I.	CHITCHAT
I put that on red bubble.	CHITCHAT
And it did well.	CHITCHAT
And then I saw on red bubble the next day, the same design that I made was posted by somebody else.	CHITCHAT
And it was on eBay too.	CHITCHAT
and I Luckily had people telling me all about this so that I could you know act on that, but Achievement.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but if you do, find that by all means, we drop that link here.	CHITCHAT
I imagine it's in a pod and there's probably a highlight of it and really.	CHITCHAT
I could probably find it if I dug hard enough on on Twitter or whatever, so.	CHITCHAT
If you can't find it.	CHITCHAT
I have very little knowledge about the the actual.	CHITCHAT
I just had somebody on my discord.	CHITCHAT
Post a link to it.	CHITCHAT
And the guy who posted it was a little bit dramatic about it like don't use the hashtag anymore.	CHITCHAT
'cause you're going to get sued.	CHITCHAT
And I didn't quite think it would be that straightforward I was certain that there was more to the story.	CHITCHAT
I looked into a little bit, but.	CHITCHAT
I'll see what the?	CHITCHAT

3000 followers cheese.	CHITCHAT
Cheese.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Um whoops.	CHITCHAT
And like I close that.	CHITCHAT
Parked.	CHITCHAT
I only caught a little bit of that I mean?	CHITCHAT
I'm not worried about it from what I understand Jake Parker's lawyer misunderstood something that he said.	CHITCHAT
And his lawyer, I said that it was probably like a publisher or something like that, so if that is in line with what actually happened there, you go.	CHITCHAT
There you go, he's making a comic book OK.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking at the chat here, there's a there's a vad uh this is a.	CHITCHAT
How old is this video?	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure it's hard to tell.	CHITCHAT
But I don't know if the chat here is too relevant just take a lesson.	CHITCHAT
Really just trying to I guess stop some people who were like selling unlicensed like merchandise, with like the inktober logo and stuff that he made.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Not but his lawyer, I guess there was a miscommunication's lawyer or his attorney, I should say.	CHITCHAT
Went and	CHITCHAT
Kind of throw the baby out with the bathwater, but I think Jake has it under control now and some people were being.	CHITCHAT
I think unnecessarily aggressive at Jake.	CHITCHAT
I know Jake personally like I can say he's not that was.	CHITCHAT
He was not trying to do like a power grab or anything like that that just does not him.	CHITCHAT
Huh.	CHITCHAT
It's uh it's interesting how quickly things like that can spiral and like that longer.	CHITCHAT
Ironically, he's probably going to lawyer for his lawyer because.	CHITCHAT
It sounds like.	CHITCHAT
The liar probably didn't do enough.	CHITCHAT
Enough dialogue with their clients really figure out like what the situation was an.	CHITCHAT
Whether or not they actually were able to like go all the way through the Copyright.	CHITCHAT
It seems like a pretty dramatic step to going from like discussing.	CHITCHAT
That topic going all the way into full on like.	CHITCHAT
Like Copyright lock download.	CHITCHAT
So that's a lot like that lawyer might have just ruined that guys career.	CHITCHAT
You know Jakes careers that is his name Jake Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Because even like if it's not a legitimate story.	CHITCHAT
People are always going to there's always going to be people thinking that that dude was trying to like you know corner of market or something like that.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for sharing that way.	CHITCHAT
That's the truth and that the truth is revealed.	CHITCHAT
Sing.	CHITCHAT
Lots are really vicious artists.	CHITCHAT
I was looking through the comments on one of the Twitter posts and people are just absolutely.	CHITCHAT
Review.	CHITCHAT
I was very upset.	CHITCHAT
I hope that I'm never never at the forefront of one of those conflicts, too much.	CHITCHAT

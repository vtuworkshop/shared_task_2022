Man, I just remembered it like a memory from my childhood of of having one of those.	CHITCHAT
It was like a where's Waldo except it was for Looney tunes characters?	CHITCHAT
And it would just be this huge illustration of.	CHITCHAT
Tons of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Environments and buildings and characters all strewn through like every page of this book.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I don't understand how people can manage do stuff like that is ludicrous.	CHITCHAT
Much detail has to go in and stuff like that much time is spent like even just doing this.	CHITCHAT
A simple little.	CHITCHAT
Little town here is taken, it's taken a little while you know.	CHITCHAT
It's crazy.	CHITCHAT
All to be forgotten, you know.	CHITCHAT
Like nobody talks about maybe I should go to like read.	CHITCHAT
It has these NIST alja threads.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should go and post one of those there and.	CHITCHAT
Research the appreciation, maybe I can do that.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
OK, down.	CHITCHAT
Skype it's incredible.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, like as as we go back in time producing art gets harder and harder and harder.	CHITCHAT
Like from a matter of like cell animation, too.	CHITCHAT
Having to like make your own paints out on the scene.	CHITCHAT
All the way back to like meetings produce like.	CHITCHAT
Like charcoal.	CHITCHAT
Charcoal to make like ink to scroll with your fingers on a cable.	CHITCHAT
Hello.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I feel like that's It's a bit weird isn't it an like Patrion is really interesting thing as well because it's starting to shift like the mindset of actually paying for stuff.	CHITCHAT
And I think that's really great.	CHITCHAT
Like gum Rd in patron.	CHITCHAT
I think I've been actually really good for that kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's a weird one and it's also really weird.	CHITCHAT
Because you can get somebody to buy a Phone for like $2000.	CHITCHAT
But the instant.	CHITCHAT
They think about paying an artist for like a print for $15 like a no way to do that for free thanks.	CHITCHAT
Not that I have a lot of personal experience with that right now, but that's that's the thing that I've seen a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Miss place value in a lot of cases.	CHITCHAT
In fairness, though you would get a lot more mileage out of a well.	CHITCHAT
I say that I mean, no probably spent $2000 on a Phone that they use for like maybe 2 years, people go through Phone cycles, a lot.	CHITCHAT
Not good.	CHITCHAT
Angry weather.	CHITCHAT
Jackie.	CHITCHAT
I think a lot of times, though.	CHITCHAT
If there was an easier way to pay people.	CHITCHAT
I think more people would be up for it.	CHITCHAT
I've noticed personally that like when I have more money in my PayPal account.	CHITCHAT
I tend to donate to people on Twitch, a lot more.	CHITCHAT
I tend to.	CHITCHAT
I tend to give money away a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Quickly.	CHITCHAT
Yes, so funny, too, and it's weird as well because I've kind of just put a baseline of $10 per meal.	CHITCHAT
When I eat food and I know I could do way better than that I could drop that number down a lot more.	CHITCHAT
But then if I were to think about buying a video game and I'm glad that I don't just like literally spent cash on video games because I would be grow very quickly doing that.	CHITCHAT
But like I won't buy a game in a lot of cases unless it's like.	CHITCHAT
Basically, free and.	CHITCHAT
Inside her slum it is weird isn't it like obviously food is more important than a game, but even still.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know there's a weird mindset to going out to get food as well.	CHITCHAT
And like I guess in fairness, though lots of like restaurants kind of.	CHITCHAT
There's a weird like expectation that people have now where if you go to get food out somewhere.	CHITCHAT

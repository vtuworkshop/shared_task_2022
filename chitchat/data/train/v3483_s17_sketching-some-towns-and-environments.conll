It's going to cost some money, you know it's going to cost you for sure.	CHITCHAT
And I think that the food companies prey on that mindset as well.	CHITCHAT
It really like to get there in miles worth?	CHITCHAT
And like for example, I've been working on this for my pen again.	CHITCHAT
We're about an hour in by now, I think right almost an hour and a half in so if I were to work at minimum wage in my state, which is 7.	CHITCHAT
Bucks 25 for this like you know reasonable like illustration, so far.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I feel like this is worth more than 7 books 25.	CHITCHAT
But like 1 this is done people will think $15 at most for a print of this.	CHITCHAT
That's like 2 hours of work at minimum wage.	CHITCHAT
You know, not to mention licenses.	CHITCHAT
My graphics tablet, which is a Huey and I went for a an off brand.	CHITCHAT
They helions have been I guess a good competitor into the canvas.	CHITCHAT
KAMV SG-22, One I think it's very large actually it's about the size of a sintic 21.	CHITCHAT
But like literally 1/4 of the price.	CHITCHAT
And I'm having a good time with it.	CHITCHAT
So far now.	CHITCHAT
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't have a good knowledge of like color profiles and correct color spaces on.	CHITCHAT
On monitors.	CHITCHAT
So I can't tell you how like correct the gamut is on this guy.	CHITCHAT
Works for me.	CHITCHAT
Obviously we're not using color right now, so.	O
But yeah, like if I were to spend.	CHITCHAT
I guess you can like resell friends right, but either way.	CHITCHAT
I actually just got this in November and I'm having a great time with it.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit awkward at first I normally would draw I had a in tools 3 and I would draw like flat.	CHITCHAT
With my main display there, but now I've got like this guy and he's like up at an angle.	O
So I've got my arm like kind of just floating in space and drawing like that.	CHITCHAT
And it was really hard to get used to, but I'm slowly picking it up.	CHITCHAT
And one major issue, I had in the past was that I couldn't really get to my keyboard.	CHITCHAT
But now I've got it on my lap, so I just got the keyboard right here.	CHITCHAT
And it's not too bad it's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I don't have an arm, either lots of people like to get an arm that they can articulate and move around.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I thought about the XP pen actually uh if you get that and you like it.	CHITCHAT
Let me know.	CHITCHAT
Let me know how that works out for you.	CHITCHAT
I was going to recommend the XP pen as well.	CHITCHAT
And this being my first display tablet.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't sure how big I wanted it.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't sure if like a fool like 22 inch display would be what I like but.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, now that I have it and it's in its large.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I could go for something smaller.	CHITCHAT
No like I can't really see the pixels.	CHITCHAT
It's obviously a little fuzzy but.	CHITCHAT
It's not it's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
It's fairly crisp, and I don't think smaller would be better for me personally.	CHITCHAT
That's really cool and I like not using into US products or a whack on products.	CHITCHAT
Because I don't like monopolies all that much.	CHITCHAT
I'm not like companies that are able to.	CHITCHAT
Just corner a whole market.	CHITCHAT
So I'm glad that you Eon is able to make some products and I haven't had any issues with it actually yet.	CHITCHAT
I've heard people talk about having issues with.	CHITCHAT
With like drivers and things like that, but so far, it's been pretty good.	CHITCHAT
The only problem is that there's a little bit of parallax.	CHITCHAT
The tip of my pen.	CHITCHAT
And we're actually ends up and it's not even that bad really but.	CHITCHAT
No matter how much how many times, I've tried to calibrate it's not made a difference Unfortunately.	CHITCHAT
But again just like.	CHITCHAT

So thinking that used to, I suppose.	CHITCHAT
Oh great.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I would recommend to start with.	CHITCHAT
Art can be really tough I think art is probably the most unforgiving hobby.	CHITCHAT
I've been drawing.	CHITCHAT
Since I was a child, I've been drawing for a really long time.	CHITCHAT
And I'm still not nearly as good as I'd like to be.	CHITCHAT
And there's a lot of people who are younger than me.	CHITCHAT
Better.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
It's frustrating for sure.	CHITCHAT
But don't let that be discouraging.	CHITCHAT
That sounds really grim but like you know.	CHITCHAT
For art you gotta you gotta put a lot into it to get anything out of it, whereas like you know if you want to play ultimate Frisbee for your hobby or even professionally you just kind of.	CHITCHAT
Keep doing it until you get into like.	CHITCHAT
I'm over simplifying it but.	CHITCHAT
Keep your expectations low at the start I suppose with my my suggestion would be, but it's very funny.	CHITCHAT
Are you Timmy Corsa?	CHITCHAT
I would recommend.	CHITCHAT
Depending on what you want to do there's a guy named shrink Connie Yoga, he's a.	CHITCHAT
He doesn't necessarily work for Blizzard.	CHITCHAT
He's a freelancer for Blizzard and he's worked on things like.	CHITCHAT
Hearthstone.	CHITCHAT
Wow, Diablo and he's got some courses on Gumroad.	CHITCHAT
And that might be something.	CHITCHAT
You're into doing game design, but if you want to do stuff, more like I guess what?	CHITCHAT
I'm doing here.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, he's got, I think he's got some brushes included as well.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of people say that you know in artist is only as good as.	CHITCHAT
Or the brush doesn't make an artist, you know, but I kind of disagree.	CHITCHAT
I think that having good tools is really helpful so.	CHITCHAT
Since you're on be hands.	O
I imagine you probably have an Adobe Adobe license.	O
Creative Cloud subscription so you can use.	O
Kyle Kyle Websters brushes, which is what I've been using it using those.	O
Miles brushes for free with the Adobe subscription.	O
He has 1 brush actually that's not too bad so this brush just got this one for free.	O
So we have to have the creative cloud thing so we have trends.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if it's like if actual last name or what, but he's not he's not Asian.	CHITCHAT
And that that looks like a pretty Japanese man.	CHITCHAT
Not that it matters what is missing?	CHITCHAT
You might be expecting a Japanese man and just see a very, very white man.	CHITCHAT
He is very bad.	CHITCHAT
I guess I'll spend a little moment I like to take breaks when I work and just think about stuff every so often.	CHITCHAT
I typically play like room world or something while I do that.	CHITCHAT
But since I'm streaming I don't really have the?	CHITCHAT
Ability to do that, so I'll just take a moment to like talk about these brushes, which is kind of cool.	O
These are meant to be like manga brushes.	O
So so doing digital manga.	O
Photoshop doesn't really have any good like quick ways to use and make screen tones, which for me has been a really big frustration because I like to do screen closer like things like that, so there a little bit awkward, but Kyle has some of these screentone brushes and it's packed and I say their awkward because.	O
There are applied based on weight for the most part like how hard you press.	O
So if I press kinda hard here.	O
Get a bit of a gradient.	O
I don't really want that a lot of the time.	O
Like to have just a nice solid.	O
Flat screen tones what I have to end up doing a lot of the time is just gently applying.	O
As consistently as possible.	O
Seems like you get an issue, there, so you have to erase it.	O
You know that is one frustration, I personally know.	CHITCHAT
And if there is a better way of doing that I'd love anybody to tell me how to do that because if I can get these screentones looking nice real quick.	CHITCHAT
That be great and of course, you could all screen tones are like.	CHITCHAT

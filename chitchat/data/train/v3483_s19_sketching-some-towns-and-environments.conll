Basically getting value through dots so it's similar to the point, Alism which is basically just a.	O
Better for us.	O
It's too small now.	O
So you can simulate.	O
Grey values by density of Blacks actually have a much better example.	O
Let me open up the bridge real quick.	O
Yeah, I don't know I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you can or not I think that the textures applied.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
I'm here.	CHITCHAT
It might be an actual texture is being applied some made what I can do is like.	O
I don't know where I would toggle the pressure as well.	O
Control with temperature control off.	O
No variation there.	O
I think he's got a couple of different.	CHITCHAT
Really applying the texture out, I would like.	O
I'm not really sure.	CHITCHAT
But the screen.	CHITCHAT
I've got these here.	CHITCHAT
Oh, the tablet level, yeah, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Let me see like I think what happens, though, if you just click with the mouse.	O
It doesn't apply any pressure sensitivity.	O
So when I click.	O
I guess it kind of supplies it smoothly.	O
That's not a bad idea.	O
It works, but they do overlap, which is a little bit of refrigeration.	O
I would really prefer having a uh fill option now there is a.	O
There is a there is a plugin and extension made by somebody.	O
That's on the.	O
Adobe extensions.	O
And then you can make a either speed lines or screentones here.	O
Let me just describe what this ringtones are a little bit more.	O
User screen tones that I've made in photo shop custom made.	O
Ringtones.	O
I made myself.	O
But you can see this looks like a grayscale value right.	O
But it's just density of pixels.	O
It's all black and white all the way down.	O
Hope this doesn't hurt your guys's eyes.	CHITCHAT
This was actually a technique used traditionally.	CHITCHAT
If you look at Liechtenstein.	CHITCHAT
He was, I think it was leaking this time, he did some really prominent pop art graphic design things.	CHITCHAT
Not like the city, but The artist.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, stuff like this these were really popular ones but.	CHITCHAT
He had lots of screentone usage in his work.	CHITCHAT
And these are all manually applied but.	CHITCHAT
It's incredible before they had computers to do this kind of thing they would manually place screen tones that were just different densities of ink.	CHITCHAT
And the manually cut those out.	CHITCHAT
And it's insane, but that's basically just what it is.	CHITCHAT
And it's Not really all that easy to apply those here with photo shop, but one thing you can do.	O
Is?	CHITCHAT
This just in case sized over commit say, were to make like a grayscale value here.	O
No.	O
And like I'll just do like a single pass of Grey.	O
Don't work.	O
And I want to add like a nice pass shading on here, but I wanted to look like.	O
A typical grayscale shape and this isn't like the worst workflow, but I can think of like better workflows for it, but	O

Will just drop like a quick quick passing here, so if I want to make this look like screen from?	O
What you can do is you can actually go to image mode, grayscale won't flatten actually probably flattered anyways for this next steps.	O
We go to bitmap and then we put in our PPI and we push OK and that converts all the Gray into different densities of black and of course, the kind of applied to my strokes as well so.	O
That works for what I would normally do is I would actually make a new document.	O
At the same file size.	O
And then copy the grayscale values and climb into the new document here and then do that.	O
Same process and it's just a little bit tedious, you know, so way better if I could just do it all of one goes now we have a great skills there.	O
Go back to grayscale the reshoot one.	O
Back to RGB.	O
And now, what we can do is do a select color range and then choose just the white because it's only black-and-white.	O
Delete that and then we can copy and paste in place again like, I said of database that's correct.	O
And there, we get a nice beautiful screen.	O
And then we can apply a nice learn noise filter make your natural but there you go that's the workflow I typically go with and.	O
Well, I actually don't do that?	CHITCHAT
what I normally do is I'll I'll choose one of my limited gradients that I like to have.	O
Try.	CHITCHAT
Great.	CHITCHAT
The number before this represents the pixels per inch so you'll get like some that are a bit.	O
Heavier.	O
With more spacing in between.	O
Some that are a lot more dense.	O
It's the same greater white value.	O
But at different times.	O
Are the issue with that, though, is that?	CHITCHAT
You still have to move it out to a different a different document.	O
Either way.	O
Because it'll flat all the layers, but, yeah, it's not a terrible idea that just make that a quick action.	O
But my workflow that I usually use is actually more like this, I'll bring in the the screen turns that I want.	O
And then I'll just make a mask and then mask those out.	O
And it's not very flexible because you kind of get stuck with this particular look but.	O
It's not the worst, but as I was saying actually there is that extension.	O
Which does do?	O
Screentones.	O
Automatically.	O
And I'll show you why I put that in there quotes.	O
This is one option that you have is to just mask out premade screen tones, which is actually a lot more like how it was done traditionally.	O
'Cause they have to literally physically cut out, the screentone sheets with an exacto knife.	O
And there are videos of that, even watch and it is insane.	CHITCHAT
Was that kind of sums up manga artists?	CHITCHAT
In general actually they're crazy?	CHITCHAT
But there's like a quick version of how I how I can do that, but again, it's very.	O
Very uh.	CHITCHAT
I have a lot of options so.	O
These are the.	CHITCHAT
Right.	O
Is it control F Oh my?	CHITCHAT
Edit.	O
So I'm on the wrong layer of course.	O
Of course I am.	CHITCHAT
So this is the screen pattern application extension.	O
And 1st of all it takes like.	O
10 seconds to load up the interface alone, but here you can see like.	O
We have a normal gradient a normal uh none for gradient for the Screentone.	O

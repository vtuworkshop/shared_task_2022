Meaning that there is no gradient applied.	O
You get a couple of options, it's kind of nice.	O
It takes a very long time to process, though I hope I don't crash Oh BS again today to be ashamed.	CHITCHAT
Speaking of O PS we've got about 15 minutes left of the stream.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I think there's a you might have to go to my profile to follow me.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm actually fairly new to behave myself.	CHITCHAT
If you click on the profile, you can follow their.	CHITCHAT
Normal I'll just apply normal grading it here.	O
But this is really handy very slight problem, though, is that?	CHITCHAT
Once you apply it.	O
It just kind of like that, and you don't know if it's good or not.	O
You don't know if that's the one you want so you'll probably have to like undo and then try it again.	O
And then it just kind of stuck here like playing around with these settings.	O
There's no good way to apply it and fiddle with it after you've done that.	O
Whereas I do think that clip studio paint, which is in fairness designed.	O
Around making like comics and manga, unlike photo shop.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
It is I think a much more easy process over there, but Again, like photo shop is not designed to make it's kind of funny how artists.	CHITCHAT
Snagged.	CHITCHAT
Basically photo shop and like Hey, you make art now.	CHITCHAT
Oh is it OK just up there.	CHITCHAT
Well thanks man I appreciate the follow.	CHITCHAT
I've been working on value studies for the last couple of weeks and this is one of my.	CHITCHAT
Rogue Rogue Line Art is.	CHITCHAT
But it's more fun for me to do this kind of stuff actually so maybe I'll do more of that in the future?	CHITCHAT
What are my schedule right now?	CHITCHAT
But yeah, like photo shop is just that.	CHITCHAT
Shop.	CHITCHAT
How did you call that shop like?	CHITCHAT
You think of shop like Leica store but not really, for modification.	CHITCHAT
How does that workout well it's your first time as well step?	CHITCHAT
I hope that my my stream has been engaging enough for you to stick around.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know why I like shop comes in the form of like alteration.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of weird in it.	CHITCHAT
It was designed for like manipulating and altering photos from the Gaza brush tool 2.	CHITCHAT
I guess that means that we're going to make art in it, and Adobe is like wait.	CHITCHAT
No, no don't do that don't do that.	CHITCHAT
Now this is for well, we don't care.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like a workshop, yeah that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
Like like a car workshop.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
And then Adobe is like well, I guess we have to like.	CHITCHAT
Build this brush framework now for.	CHITCHAT
Refused to use other tools.	CHITCHAT
And I'm glad that they have 'cause I.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Like I've been using photo shop for such a long time.	CHITCHAT
At this point like I'm familiar with all the all the keys in the shortcuts in the Workflow.	CHITCHAT
And it's so awkward to move to a different tool.	CHITCHAT
Some clever Photoshop in Adobe have.	CHITCHAT
Moving more towards like illustrator friendly.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of sad that despite how long I've used Photoshop, though I'm not.	CHITCHAT
I'm not very good at actually using it for its purpose.	CHITCHAT
I can do.	CHITCHAT
Some, like really simple.	CHITCHAT
Edison is like that, like background replacements and.	CHITCHAT
Like I can remove.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like to share this with you guys.	CHITCHAT
I was working on fiber for a little bit.	O
I know God forbid.	CHITCHAT
But I was doing wow that stretched out all the way.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
So we can find this quickly.	O
Right.	O
Here it is.	O
I was doing work on fiber rose removing stuff from like the background of things, so we've got these 2 photos here.	O
With this guy.	O
And like What else was there I think it was mostly just that guy in the way and I took him out and like I don't know that's reasonably high level right?	CHITCHAT

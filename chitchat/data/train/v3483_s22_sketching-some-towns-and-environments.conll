So I'm not like a total like photo shop new but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Curtis definitely like.	CHITCHAT
A tool for.	CHITCHAT
People who can't afford art tools.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Nothing wrong with that.	CHITCHAT
I think clip studio paint.	CHITCHAT
From everything I've heard about it is.	CHITCHAT
The next best bet.	CHITCHAT
No, the clone stamp tools.	O
Never overused.	O
It's only overused when you can see the the the the tile.	O
The repetition of the sample.	O
That's only time it's a problem otherwise go for it nothing wrong.	O
Phone stamp tools fantastic.	O
I never use it in like my heart.	O
I only use it for like altering photos.	O
But like maybe what I could do is like?	CHITCHAT
S.	CHITCHAT
Check this out, we're going to copy this tree.	O
You could like you know use the last soap tooling based or you just just do that.	O
The problem is now.	CHITCHAT
Most likely not.	CHITCHAT
I think it's fine.	CHITCHAT
Although.	CHITCHAT
I wonder what tool would be the most used tool for the job that is not supposed to do.	CHITCHAT
I wonder Yeah, like I thought maybe like?	CHITCHAT
The pencil tool like I only ever use the pencil tool for pixel art.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
Like what what is the devs have in mind when they build slide?	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
Manipulation.	CHITCHAT
Did they think somebody's gonna like grab this tool?	CHITCHAT
And do things that we had no plans for them to do, and then Furthermore getting mad about it not doing that.	CHITCHAT
OK, we got about 8 minutes left before I had my 2 hour goal was opening is 2 hours in today and I'll be back tomorrow, actually for another 2 hours.	CHITCHAT
So I think I made some decent progress.	CHITCHAT
I didn't quite get as much done as I would have liked.	CHITCHAT
But I think I ended up being a bit more keeps doing that, too.	CHITCHAT
It's coming along nice and slow, though.	CHITCHAT
I need.	CHITCHAT
I've got this.	CHITCHAT
I think this is a photo I took actually and I converted it into a screen tone.	O
Let's just put it in place here to make it feel a little bit more.	O
Finished.	O
And I think I might come back to this tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
I like to have a good plan for my permit began streams.	CHITCHAT
On Twitch I'm not very thoughtful about what I stream.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit of a different air to it.	CHITCHAT
So and I like to try to make my art.	CHITCHAT
And what I do on the platform.	CHITCHAT
Kind of reflect that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, as you're learning to do art stuff, I highly recommend.	CHITCHAT
Like tackling masks very confidently masks are super great and for a long time I didn't know.	CHITCHAT
I didn't really have a need for them to be fair.	CHITCHAT
When I was younger, foot like I was kind of scared of using it too.	CHITCHAT
But they are incredible and I can probably do I know.	CHITCHAT
Ryan I should share I should share Ryan stream link here.	CHITCHAT
But he Did a little stream, about masks?	CHITCHAT
I don't know what the context?	CHITCHAT
Was I don't watch the video yet but.	CHITCHAT

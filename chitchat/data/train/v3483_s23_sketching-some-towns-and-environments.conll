There should be like whenever those pop up there should be a like a tick box that says turn off the promise.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I haven't had those popups in along time.	CHITCHAT
Save this.	O
It's probably in the preferences, though.	O
Under General.	O
Speak one done don't want that to happen thanks.	CHITCHAT
Oh also I recommend turning on the legacy free transform stick bugs.	O
If you don't have any like predispositions.	O
Towards the old version.	O
Maybe it's not a big deal, but I have to have this off.	O
It's too awkward otherwise 1st.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, maybe it's like in workspace or.	O
I'll handle it.	O
That's a good question actually.	CHITCHAT
I would guess it would have been one of those too.	O
But I don't see it there.	O
If you get those popping up again, there's probably just an option that says don't show these anymore.	O
How many minutes?	CHITCHAT
I have to go away eventually.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to worry too much about out clean.	CHITCHAT
Right now.	CHITCHAT
Give me Wow.	CHITCHAT
Uncheck box will probably just go away on their own when I updated to the 2020 version.	O
I didn't get any pop up side there, so I think it came with my user preferences.	O
How to disable and enable rich tooltips so there are the tooltips were if you like hover your cursor now they like show an actual like example video of what they do, which is kind of neat.	O
For your talking about like when you jump into your canvas it's uh.	O
It's trying to help you out with something and you're like, no, I don't really care what you have to say.	O
Oh, that one.	CHITCHAT
So not under.	CHITCHAT
Or is it pretty.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there, you go.	CHITCHAT
That's what you want right.	O
I wanted to make this a little segment and I think when I do this in the future.	O
I'll make this more than just the last 2 minutes of the stream.	CHITCHAT
Let me briefly like do a summary of what I've got going on here.	CHITCHAT
OK fantastic well look at.	CHITCHAT
So, just very briefly bit of a summary.	CHITCHAT
I did some like general like.	O
Rough concepts of.	O
I want my structure look we went with this one.	O
And then I scaled it up and did a loose sketch folder Top.	O
And then dropped in some colors for little bit of context and theme.	O
And then from there, I just went from my inks right away.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
I might do like a grayscale wash as well.	O
Yeah, this place what we did.	O
Twitch has a cool feature where you can actually go from one extreme to the next and just take all the viewers along with you and that's really handy, but Unfortunately the hands doesn't have anything like that just yet.	CHITCHAT

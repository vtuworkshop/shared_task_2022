Pens markers, I see the Centriq Stylus, so you bring in some of the detail to see how it flows.	O
But even at this stage, you want to keep it in a sketchy.	O
Pencil sketch, drawing so that you can always adjust an clean up and let that composition.	O
Talk to you see if this is what you want.	O
So now that I did that with the letter.	O
Ji am going to start with the inking which in this case is going to be the vector brushes.	O
So on the right hand side.	O
We have our layers.	O
We cannot see my control, so let me fix that real quick for you.	CHITCHAT
There it is there, we go?	CHITCHAT
I'm using an app called Cinna maker to live stream air.	CHITCHAT
It is save it boom now.	CHITCHAT
You can see it so on the right hand side you see where my layers icon is I can turn the layers off and on or hide him and bring him out.	O
So I had my layer.	O
So when I'm laying my hand on that right side you don't see I don't know accidentally hit some of a different layer and then I end up drawing underlayer that I don't want to.	O
On the left hand side have more brushes.	O
The 3rd brush icon from the Top is the vector brushes.	O
The thickness on my lines is 3.5.	O
Let me bring that out for you so you can see it there.	CHITCHAT
It is the thickness of the brushes 3.5.	O
The color is blue.	O
I'm not used any other colors.	O
I did for the pencil in it.	O
I guess I sure did it started with the black color that might have been already set and then the purple to do this.	O
Pencil sketching and I'm using the blue and I just use different colors for the different layers.	O
So that I can recognize what I'm looking at an when you zoom out and look at this and you know the color difference gives you an idea of what you're looking at in that dark blue is the vector lines so that's my vector brush.	O
My brush settings.	O
I need to turn out that pressure dynamic so I was doing a little bit of testing with a with a stylus.	O
Earlier and I ended up turning that on so that I could test the sensitivity the pressure.	O
So, there, it is I got what I need right sometimes I check these things sometimes I forget.	CHITCHAT
Because I'm here with you, I am checking them so that I can give an explanation of what we got going on Alright.	CHITCHAT
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
Now it's time for the letter J Let's go ahead and get started.	O
And the first things that I do is just tackle something don't worry about what should I start with where should I go.	CHITCHAT
Let's just do something right.	CHITCHAT
So here we have a pencil this upside down and come on here we go.	O
There we go no, I don't want that line.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
There we go the pencil cool.	O
And let's do that one again boom.	O
There it is we got a pencil.	O
Where is drawing done you gotta shake of- whatever things that happen in your life let them all back off of you and get into your drawing mode.	CHITCHAT
That's what we're doing right now, getting into the drawing mode.	CHITCHAT
So right now, I'm feeling like everything else is OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm comfortable with it, so let's just start drawing.	CHITCHAT
If you've been following this series, you'll know that I am.	CHITCHAT
Focused on drawing all these are tools.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to have a organic field.	O
Wanted to feel like their actual real drawings.	O
And not like a uh.	O
Very traditional vector illustration that has very.	O
Sharpen clinical look.	O
That's it.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Less a key role in.	O
I am going to draw this pen, but now when I draw this pin here.	O
I don't want it to be next to the color palette the way it is so I started a new layer and I'll start drawing this pin this brush pen.	O
There we go.	O
And once I'm done drawing it.	O

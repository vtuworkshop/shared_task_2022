What I want to do is move it?	O
So that's why I draw it on a different layer.	O
We do have the.	O
Lasso tool so we can move things if we want to, but it's easier to just go ahead and do it.	O
This way look at that boom boom boom there.	CHITCHAT
It is done.	CHITCHAT

There we go bomb on like that tip.	CHITCHAT
Fix it every day is only.	CHITCHAT
Mom had to go here, we go here, we go.	CHITCHAT
There it is cool get another pan moves.	CHITCHAT
You gotta be careful with the way you touch.	CHITCHAT
The screen, yeah, let's move that over.	CHITCHAT
'Cause I'm on the surface, so the surface version of Adobe fresco has much more sensitive touch controls than the iPad.	O
I know because I tried them both.	CHITCHAT
Alright and why am I drawing on the iPad.	O
I mean on the surface instead of the iPad because I do like the way.	O
I can export.	O
On the iPad directly into my.	O
Files.	O
I mean, like how I can export from the surface directly into my files.	O
And then we're asking the iPad you export to drop box and then it syncs up with your.	O
Computer and then that's when you grab the file so you want to always export.	O
As a PDF when you're working with vector brushes so that way.	O
You cannot open that file in Adobe Illustrator, an have full control of your.	O
Anchor points.	O
An scalability.	O
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
OK, I like that pan.	O
I wanna move that pen over so that it's sticking out.	O
But once that happens, then it's going to yeah, so there, it is.	CHITCHAT
It's cool like that right there boom done.	CHITCHAT
So then that line is going to stop right there, OK OK.	O
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
That's alright.	O
It's good.	CHITCHAT
I like it OK, OK, yeah, I'm just looking thinking drawing.	CHITCHAT
I'm using a lot of layers right now, but I'm going to go ahead and not not merge that one 'cause that one has crossover thing so less a merge now let's wait for the merging.	O

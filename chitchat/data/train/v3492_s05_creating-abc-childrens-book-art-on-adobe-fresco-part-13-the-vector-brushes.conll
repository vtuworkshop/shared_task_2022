Let me see I'm in a new layer.	O
Vector.	O
Brush.	O
There we go.	O
Like than those lines are outside of your drawing of your letter J as OK.	O
'Cause I'm going to.	O
Switch it up.	O
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
Scared.	CHITCHAT
The side clean that up.	O
There we go, we see that's cool that's cool yo.	CHITCHAT
So let's do the other side of that marker.	O
Done.	O
I kinda like it.	CHITCHAT
Let me know what you think.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Nice that's it that's the letter J.	O
This is pretty simple is let me turn that off so we can see everything.	O
Merge down looks OK.	O
It's a little weird right there with those 2 pins are but I think we can live with that.	O
Boom.	CHITCHAT
You gotta sign your name is still 2019.	CHITCHAT
We have some time left to work on our pieces.	CHITCHAT
Now that I finished the letter.	O
J you know what I need to make a screenshot.	O
Go up to export boom export It says Vector.	O
I was going to be vector Jay.	O
Export is on the bottom it's on behind my head if I can turn off my head.	O
You can see the rest of it boom export.	O
PDF is sujay save.	O
It is saving in the same folder where everything is.	O
That I am in saving along.	O
Is it this is getting to be a big document?	CHITCHAT
And what I'm going to do is get rid of some of these layers now, so that's done, I'll just do that now right.	O
So there's the whole alphabet and as you can see.	O
Here on the right size.	O
Yamma layers right so the letter, A?	O
Has that one layer?	O
Let's turn that off there's a second a layer?	O
Which is for the sketches.	O
And then There's a third layer and that was when I was first testing out this technique.	O
So let's go ahead and get rid of that layer 'cause.	O
It's a pixel layer and we don't need anymore.	O
But we will keep the the last 2A layers will keep that one and will keep this one.	O
The belayer has 3 also there's one that one.	O
There is the second sketch layer.	O
And then finally the 1st.	O
Shape layer for the Bing so when I started the alphabet.	O
I did a lot of testing with the letter, A an and then I once I figured out what I wanted all the less the rest of the letters.	O
I just went ahead and did the sketches with shapes.	O
Delete layer gone but will turn back.	O
This one on done let her see it.	O
Same way that's that one.	O
This is the one that needs to go.	O
Delete it.	O
And then let's get this one, the D delete that.	O
The A.	O
Delete that.	O
So the F has 3 layers.	O
Also, there's 1 layer.	O
We want this layer.	O
We don't want.	O
Delete it.	O
The gene.	O
The late Feels like I've done a lot of drawings as you can see.	CHITCHAT
Delete the eye.	O

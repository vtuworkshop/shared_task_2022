Hey, what's going on everybody fresh cake here and with another night of live stream in so it's Saturday night.	CHITCHAT
Anne has a lot of guys know that or watching in tuning in every Saturday.	CHITCHAT
I go live.	CHITCHAT
I do a quick stream of.	CHITCHAT
I just something kinda cool from start to finish and yeah, we're going to be working on Adobe fresco tonight.	O
On the iPad.	O
If you know anything about Adobe live and are in the live streams here on Behance.	CHITCHAT
You know that you can go back and watch replays so if you see something that you like me doing.	CHITCHAT
You want a little bit more about it.	CHITCHAT
I usually use the same.	CHITCHAT
Tips and tricks every stream.	CHITCHAT
I tried to call out the things I'm doing as best I can.	CHITCHAT
But if you feel like you missed something you can always watch it in the replay go back take a peek.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
You know make sure you kinda are learning along the way and if you see something that I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
I don't call it out, maybe watch one of the old replays.	CHITCHAT
Probably call it out there, I want to apologize.	CHITCHAT
I had some lag on my last stream.	CHITCHAT
I left the video up 'cause the audio is fine, but the video is kind of.	CHITCHAT
So go through maybe scrub check out the art there.	CHITCHAT
It's really cool.	CHITCHAT
But the stream quality was kind of like.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Any who yeah, so tonight, we're going to be working again.	O
Adobe fresco as you guys know I use.	O
A6 Gen iPad it's like the 9.7 inch.	O
It's the older model, the new one.	CHITCHAT
I think is like a 10.5 but one of the really cool things about using the iPad.	CHITCHAT
Like just the standard iPad.	CHITCHAT
It's really cheap model.	CHITCHAT
I think they go for like anywhere from like 3 to $400.	CHITCHAT
Which is super rad and you can get one for pretty cheap and it's nice because you have the ability to like not spend a bunch of money and still use awesome software.	CHITCHAT
Like fresco.	CHITCHAT
I know there's been some concern in the past about so I'm trying to move some cords out of the way here so I'm comfortable I draw.	CHITCHAT
Comfort is key I know in the past.	CHITCHAT
There's been some concerns about like you know doing it in iPad versus iPad pro like?	CHITCHAT
What's the difference iPad Air?	CHITCHAT
Notice no difference, I've gotten used this software on multiple tablets and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I've never really had any problems like the live brushes on the iPad work fine.	CHITCHAT
My iPad right now is a little overloaded because I'm super cheap and I bought like the base model.	CHITCHAT
It is only 32 gig.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that effects.	CHITCHAT
It 'cause it's almost filled up already so my life brushes can lag.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I'm also like really crammed on space.	CHITCHAT
So that's going to get an upgrade soon but food for thought if you are in the market to get a tablet for drawing.	CHITCHAT
I recommend the iPad I've had no problems with it.	CHITCHAT
I really dig it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so anyway, let's get going here.	CHITCHAT
Cool brush so as you guys all know I like to draw with the basic pencil just to start out and I usually pick a color blue something that kind of works just to create like a blue line.	O

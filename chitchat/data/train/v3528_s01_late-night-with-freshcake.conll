I've started using red line to to like add in detail, which has been really cool and you know.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't know like it's just a new technique that I started adding adding into this so it will start drawing.	O
I actually brought with me.	CHITCHAT
Today this giant skateboard deck.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure you're wondering why I'm bringing this up.	CHITCHAT
I always wanted to paint my own deck and I think I'm actually going to digital illustration.	O
I think it just hit the mic with it, so I'm sorry if you heard that.	CHITCHAT
I've always wanted to do digital illustration on escape deck so I'm considering doing that.	O
And I've tried in the past with some prints and done vinyl like for instance.	O
Stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
And it was kind of cool and sort of work, but not so well so I bought this blank deck off Amazon for like $10.	CHITCHAT
They said it was a true blanket came to me orange, so I have to sand it down and it says runner on it if you guys could see that down here.	CHITCHAT
For the trucks go so I'm going to say it all that off so that I have a nice blank thing, but I want to create a drawing that I can use.	O
To create a digital print out of and put on the board.	O
I don't know how to do that, yet.	CHITCHAT
I will post that project, though, in my Behance page under my projects you can go check that out.	CHITCHAT
You can see my process.	CHITCHAT
I'll post photos and stuff like that there and do a whole entire Gallery.	CHITCHAT
So you can really see the full work but.	CHITCHAT
It's going to start right here tonight on this little 4K canvas, which I believe is like 4000 by 4000 or 40.	O
4060 Bucks or something weird like that in Frisco and it's just a big square.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to draw with Vector.	O
I don't tend to do any kind of.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I intend to do anything crazy.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be just doing some vector work 'cause.	O
I think the way I'm going to the board when it's all done is sorry.	O
I'm trying to close some stuff out here on my computer.	CHITCHAT
The way I'm going to the board is I'm going to make this thing I'm going to print it out on a vinyl machine cut the vinyl and then use that as a stencil to paint over.	O
So I get really nice clean lines.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to be working in vector so I could have probably worked on a smaller canvas.	O
You know what let's shrink it down so let's go over here, yeah, there, we go 4096.	O
In 96, I'm not working with pixel images.	O
I don't need such a large canvas.	O
So when we shrink this down so let's just tap in here.	O
Let's pick, like the 2100 by twenty one hundred an will hit OK.	O
And there, we go got a small canvas smaller canvas.	O
So it's a little lighter weight easier to move around.	O
Those are things that note as artists like definitely try to remember what you guys are going to be.	CHITCHAT
Doing if you're going to print your probably wanna make something larger and use like 300 DPI where if you're doing digital.	O
Some of the smaller 72.	O
DPI specially if you're working in vector you can work really kind of small.	O
You know it makes it a lot easier.	O
So let's grab our brush.	O
Let's start something here.	O
I don't really know what to draw.	CHITCHAT
Don't know at least it start out kind of making something here circles always start with circles and it will be like a?	O
Big like Do you like big head?	O
Like with some kind of large chin.	O
Be kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
The down cell again if you guys are watching and tune it in you want to hop in the chat ask me questions.	CHITCHAT
Feel free.	CHITCHAT
He streams I'm always pretty already don't like what I'm making these streams are always pretty loosey goosey you know.	CHITCHAT
Kind of makes stuff up as I go.	CHITCHAT
I'll be honest since I gave myself a project now the skateboard thing that I just showed.	CHITCHAT
I'm like thinking now, I had on my car wait?	CHITCHAT
How does this play does this work in this medium and?	CHITCHAT
Will work on the deck so?	CHITCHAT
I don't know maybe just like myself out let's do like A.	CHITCHAT
Boys room guys like looking up, the males open will do something a little different today will do something like dude, looking down.	CHITCHAT
We did this face for 36 days of type.	CHITCHAT
Like.	CHITCHAT
Well, back, I think I still have it in here.	CHITCHAT
Oh, boy, we're going way back.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if we find it.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Commander Adobe draw Oh boy OK here, we go.	O
Now this turned out way easier than I thought.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I did this face a while back and I really liked it by the way something really cool about fresco that I should point out.	O
The way that I'm pulling this off right now.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Fresco this is my E drawing for 36 days of type fresco or one of the cool thing about Adobe in general is because we have the?	O
Creative cloud a lot of these drawings and stuff like that actually got imported from the old drawing apps.	O
Via the creative cloud, which is really cool Boo.	O
Sorry I dropped enough Bob did cars there.	CHITCHAT
And Yeah, it's really cool like you know that's the.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't know it's exciting like I got super pumped about that 'cause you make all these drawings and I want to switch it over to France go to work.	CHITCHAT
Professionally and yeah, it's one of the things that's just super awesome that, like I was able to explain myself because I.	CHITCHAT

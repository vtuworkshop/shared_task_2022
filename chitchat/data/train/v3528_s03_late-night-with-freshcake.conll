No, she doesn't have a nose, but I don't mind that.	CHITCHAT
What are your thoughts?	CHITCHAT
Let me know should he have a nose or not.	CHITCHAT
Or as much space put a nose and I ask that question was going to get nose into my car.	CHITCHAT
I think I like Ray, something to figure it out.	CHITCHAT
So again I started doing this to kind of help myself This looks weird right now.	CHITCHAT
But just to help myself kind of clean up my blue line sketches because.	CHITCHAT
They're starting to get a little wild and like I'm starting to like too much.	CHITCHAT
Cinnamon then I as I'm drawing.	CHITCHAT
I start to lose my place of like.	CHITCHAT

What is that I was going to make?	CHITCHAT
I found it really helpful recently and I can shoot I could show you guys, some of this stuff actually.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Hesitated for a second accident if I want to give it away.	CHITCHAT
Internet show everybody this stuff a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I started doing some, like you know animation frames and trying to figure out how to use fresco in a way to create.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't have like a like a timeline tool like photo shop, which I kind of wish it did.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But I want to show everybody like you know started doing this technique because I started doing some animating it was.	CHITCHAT
Easier to draw quickly with the blue and then kind of go in and clean up obviously to get like a more.	CHITCHAT
Refined animation.	CHITCHAT
So this tooth.	O
And then this comes here in this comes over.	O
This whole area is filled.	O

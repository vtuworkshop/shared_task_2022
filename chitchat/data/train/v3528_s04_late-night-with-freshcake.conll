So I make sure I'm not missing anything in the chat I have my window hidden.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool so we're just going to basically work.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll fill them with color that would be kind of cool.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Let's see let's.	CHITCHAT
With this guy down.	O
And this year and I'm just going to lower this down a little bit.	O
So it's just nice kind of ghosted image in the background.	O
Make a new layer now one of the things I fresco make a new layer or if I have a layer selected that was let's say this is a pixel layer here.	O
Just put that on there real quick.	O
Let's say I grab my vector brush and I decided to make a vector line.	O
Yes, what fresco knows that it's not supposed to be a pixel layer makes a new layer for the pixel brush specifically.	O
And it leaves your I'm sorry for the vector brush specifically leisure pixel brush alone on the pixel layer down here.	O
And then you can switch back and forth between them, something pretty awesome.	O
It's just kind of a handy little tool.	O
Now, if you make a new layer altogether and you grab your vector brush and you start drawing with the vector line.	O
Guess what?	CHITCHAT
Recognizes it converts it over into a vector layer.	O
So that's one of the cool things about fresco.	O
It works with those 2 different layers pixel and.	O
Vector.	O
Had a brain fart forgot was called.	CHITCHAT
Wait.	CHITCHAT
Let's start out starting this, dude.	CHITCHAT
So let's go down here.	O
Let's turn my smoothing down 'cause his that way too high.	O
Usually, bad around 85.	O
I like smooth lines so that I find is a comfortable.	O
Area for me to draw where it creates a smooth line, but at the same time, it also kind of allows for.	O
You know, not a lot of lag like you put this moving up way too high and you start to draw all of a sudden you're like.	O
Pencil is way ahead of Russian, it's kind of weird.	O
Hoops and let's put on pressure and dynamic.	O
Let's just start making an ear.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's put in mouth always work in separate layers because it's less destructive and I kind of like doing it that way.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
No why made that upper lip cut a curve down like that, but little from liking.	O
It now and I'm thinking.	O
Going to cause some issues here.	O
But stick with it.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Digging these teeth.	O
Alright we got a guy forming here.	CHITCHAT
Seizure that part in the stream or I start making up like word stories about my characters.	CHITCHAT
Like What is this guys tail?	CHITCHAT
Let me know in the chat with you think the tail is about this dude.	CHITCHAT
It will I don't know my story about battle.	CHITCHAT
Like I said earlier I kind of put that one into the universe about him being like A.	CHITCHAT
Going to run down Wall Street stockbroker, so maybe that's what it is.	CHITCHAT
Let's connect these 2.	O
Worked out, so if anyone is new to this and new to fresco curious as to what the heck.	CHITCHAT
I just did.	O
To erase that line, there's a little like dot here if you tap it, it creates turns your brush into.	O
Eraser and you can use it to kind of like we should have something selected you can use it too.	O
Erase lines, which I thought was really cool.	O
Oops I should check down.	O
It's kind of nice 'cause.	O
I always take my eraser and will set it really large so I have like a big?	O
Eraser and then I have my brush with an eraser as a secondary so it's easier to switch back and forth.	O
I'm not constantly resizing.	O
Things you know.	CHITCHAT
Just a little.	CHITCHAT
Pro tip there, I guess, he will take it for what it's worth.	CHITCHAT
The letter.	CHITCHAT
Let's bring this tooth up there.	O
Let's bring this tooth up it's put that there.	O
And let's.	CHITCHAT
Parties.	CHITCHAT
Making more teeth.	O
So earlier I was talking about replays and didn't want to point out that I do another stream specifically for replace it shorter.	CHITCHAT

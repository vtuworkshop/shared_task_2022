Usually about 10 to 20 minutes, which I know I feel like in the world of digital video content that is like?	CHITCHAT
Really long.	CHITCHAT
Uhm but do another stream configured it out where I take a piece of Adobe software an either try to figure it out.	CHITCHAT
Or teach you something about it may be something that I recently learned and want to share.	CHITCHAT
It's all about just trying to figure out what you can do.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much with the creative cloud and Adobe and I share a bunch of cool stuff on there.	CHITCHAT
One of my favorites that I did not too long ago was uh.	CHITCHAT
Was a beer can like art kind of thing with Adobe dimensions, so if you're looking to learn some new software.	CHITCHAT
Maybe that's a good way to help you out.	CHITCHAT
Go check it out.	CHITCHAT
It is in the replays under my Behance profile and yeah, you know just some.	CHITCHAT
Little food for thought there for everybody.	CHITCHAT
One of the cool things about this about this streaming service if you will is that.	CHITCHAT
They have the ability for really nice replays like that, you guys always go back and check them out.	CHITCHAT
It's like everybody has that though like any kind of streaming service but.	CHITCHAT
Still.	CHITCHAT
Twitch and all those.	CHITCHAT
All right there, we go.	O
I don't know if I like that little like.	O
Inside of his mouth that I put in the background there.	O
So people will lose that 'cause we don't have that in layer well.	O
I can't speak always add that in later.	O
Got hung up.	O
That.	O
Just there.	O
And that shared in a minute.	CHITCHAT
Do a new layer.	O
Click here.	O
Dynamics.	O
So I'm turning off pressure dynamics because I want to be able to have the ability to.	O
Keep it the same.	O
OK.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's grab this guy.	O
Glad the circle.	O
Alright so to my knowledge fresco does not have the ability to add in shapes yet like Adobe draw.	O
Or sketch had so this is the way that I do it.	O
I use the masking tool or yeah, mass tool to create a circle.	O
Grab my little paint bucket here fill it in and make it a vector.	O
And then deselect.	O
Duplicate.	O
Make it.	O
White.	O
Bill.	CHITCHAT
Grab this shrink it down center it and.	O
Sure, y'all are seeing what's happening here, we're starting to get a nice circle for the eye.	O
That's a really good way to create shapes and also have a little bit of control over.	O
Like the thickness of where lines are 'cause like I probably want that line that's you know if this head is kind of.	O
Turned a little sideways there won't probably that line closest to us to be thicker 'cause of perspective.	O
Some of these guys down let's grab tap this little guy here, the circle.	O
So you turn the paint bucket into an eraser and just tap inside and boom we erase that section.	O
And now we can see what's going on, we can instructions out here.	CHITCHAT
Some dogs barking in the background.	CHITCHAT
With the market at.	CHITCHAT
You know what let's just duplicate this really quick.	O
Here and here.	O
Facebook.	CHITCHAT
Well done.	CHITCHAT
This work as we made an eyeball.	O
This line.	O
You can put this in and let's leave the chain on its own layer.	O
For now.	O
And let's do let's draw in some of all details.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
This guy's pretty tired.	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
Good.	CHITCHAT
I don't know maybe there's more here.	CHITCHAT

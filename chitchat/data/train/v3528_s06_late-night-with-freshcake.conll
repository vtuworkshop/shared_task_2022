I like that line on the Top let's remove that really quick.	O
Can't fill I don't want you to fill his way to race there we go.	O
Her when we think.	CHITCHAT
Now he needs that that line underneath moving this line on Top.	O
I think those lines are not going to cut right.	O
Trying to remember that going to run this through a vinyl machine later and see if I can get it to go into a?	CHITCHAT
Skateboard.	CHITCHAT
But you know what?	CHITCHAT
It's part of the creative process.	CHITCHAT
Let's just see.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it'll work if it doesn't fix it.	CHITCHAT
OK let's put this.	O
Let's put his head in.	O
Click I'm breezing through this one tonight.	CHITCHAT
Or 30 minutes in I'm like almost done.	CHITCHAT
Crazy.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
True.	CHITCHAT
And we're going to put in their hair.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Whenever I make her.	CHITCHAT
Really lazy about it in the house to describe that just now.	CHITCHAT
Here let's lower this opacity down a little bit.	O
And the reason why I say that is because I was just make these giant like amorphous blobs for starters.	O
So, like not.	CHITCHAT
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's like a severe lack of control like do this paint bucket fill, it in.	O
And let's grab this guy here.	O
OK, so race that.	O
Then we're going to.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I feel like it looks like a just pick my nose is known as doing scratching it, which is right underneath.	CHITCHAT
Huh.	CHITCHAT
Ooh you see that guy, he picks his nose.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool, then I fill it in and then I have, like luscious locks, you know.	O
Then just painting in the detail.	O
Makes a lot easier.	O
And it's always nice like 100 art teacher in college and always pointed out that like you need to have something to help.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, you're drawing like a large spotted black or some kind of.	O
I don't know I don't focus point, 'cause That's not what I mean, but just something that helps anchor the drawing down.	O
And you know large blocks of color always a really good way to do that to kind of help.	O
No just help it along a little bit.	O
Give your eyes, something that kind of kind of get locked in on.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
One of the ways to do that always was to just add in like areas of black like Phil stuff in and we used to do like these like.	O
Pretty large drawings actually trying to see if I have any of my board here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like stuff like this like we used to do these like really cool illustrations.	CHITCHAT
I'm never gonna see that where it was like these like?	CHITCHAT
Modge Podge is have like little characters and stuff, and you just kinda Bristol and like sketched all over him.	CHITCHAT
And then you'd have to find spots in filaments like the ground under this like weird characters foot, right here.	CHITCHAT
Get the filament in black and it was always kind of cool, we would do like these other little like.	CHITCHAT
Exercises where we would take like should scan this in now.	CHITCHAT

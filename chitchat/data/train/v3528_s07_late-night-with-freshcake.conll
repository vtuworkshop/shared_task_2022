This is actually from college.	CHITCHAT
I should scan this in.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I don't know retrace over it and stuff, but in in kit in Prescott would be awesome.	CHITCHAT
But one of the cool things to eat to do is like?	CHITCHAT
We would take a little piece of paper in Kendall Square out and put it on this like large splash page and then find really detailed areas that we thought really cool.	CHITCHAT
And then you would use that to you know identify like a unique spot and then add in some black to that area and you get a really unique drawing out of it was a really neat exercise.	CHITCHAT
How to draw backwards by accident and that's something that I should start to consider?	CHITCHAT
OK let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's just do this with this election there.	O
Dirt, sand in detail.	O
He just went too far with those 2 lines.	O
Did?	CHITCHAT
Let's see if more people joined watching you guys have any questions is what I'm doing or what I'm drawing in.	CHITCHAT
Under the party want to know some stuff.	CHITCHAT
Feel free to ask.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Little conversation going.	CHITCHAT
Art dot map I don't know music.	CHITCHAT
We will talk about.	CHITCHAT
Let's guys got some, like weird liver spot things going on as I always do I think it's like a common theme right now?	CHITCHAT
A lot of my illustrations.	CHITCHAT
Sort of wonder if I liked it better without that.	CHITCHAT
I like it just clean, but I don't know.	CHITCHAT
3 think.	CHITCHAT
The response no liver spots.	CHITCHAT
Put on a new layer.	CHITCHAT
That way we can turn it on and off as we please.	CHITCHAT
If you look at the shot through this, drawing like way quicker than I thought I would.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here let's add in.	CHITCHAT
Let's talk about this earlier, but I wasn't sure if I liked.	CHITCHAT
Having a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
Phil right here, but I think I want it.	CHITCHAT
Now you know leave it off like that without.	CHITCHAT
Board will you with it or does it need to come from here?	CHITCHAT
So many questions not answers.	CHITCHAT
So think about ad that I need to add like a cheek and oops.	O
Go down that Rd.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's just leave it blank let's leave it alone.	O
Alright so we got this cool guy.	O
Let's see here so next step.	CHITCHAT
I want to take all these layers.	O
Let's put them altogether.	O
And like I said, This is an illustration.	O
That's going to get put on a board somehow.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to put it on a board.	O
Skateboard wider we have put it, there, but And I'll post that process, but for the you know in my projects like I say it but.	CHITCHAT
Why we're here?	CHITCHAT
Why don't we duplicate this an make a fun colored illustration out of it?	O
So let's fill this guy in let's do.	O
Fairly quickly to fill him in you know what?	CHITCHAT
Let's try something fairly cold process that I used to do.	O
We have a really weird great hour.	CHITCHAT
Drop it behind.	CHITCHAT
Let's Do this, let's.	CHITCHAT
Work layers in Group.	O
Then merge down so we had this nice vector layer grab our paint bucket, which we already have selected.	O
That are a little colder widget.	O
I don't really know what to call this thing, but tap this.	CHITCHAT
Tap on the outside.	O
Let's race.	O
All that great on the back.	O
So now are on that on the outside of it?	O
What is presumably?	CHITCHAT
Behind the head so that we have this kind of like nice sort of building character.	O
We kind of see areas.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Let's just like this just fill in some stuff here.	O
I'm trying to have more process to my drawings to help me kind of make better illustrations.	CHITCHAT
And one thing that I found is kind of nice is doing this little bit of.	O

Like a grayscale sort of thing.	O
Just to kind of help figure out the depth what things are closer with things or not.	O
You know, I was watching a live stream with.	CHITCHAT
Damn, I'm further thanks a lot of definitely probably know who he is if you're especially if you're here on Behance.	CHITCHAT
Or if you're on Instagram or anything else and you follow art really talented artists anyway.	CHITCHAT
I saw him doing this on a stream recently and I kind of thought in my head.	CHITCHAT
I should probably do something similar.	CHITCHAT
I think it was him that was doing it.	CHITCHAT
I hope it was otherwise would be really awkward.	CHITCHAT
If you saw this, it was like I don't do that at all.	CHITCHAT
This guy made that up.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
So anyway that paint bucket.	O
I'll start grabbing some colors here.	O
Hello C, Oops.	CHITCHAT
So one thing I hope fresco brings in is.	CHITCHAT
What's it called?	CHITCHAT
The CC libraries, 'cause I have a bunch of color palettes saved and I make them like all the time and I would love to be able to have access to those.	CHITCHAT
And use them right here in Frisco and currently they don't.	CHITCHAT
But I heard that they're coming so.	CHITCHAT
You know keep your eyes peeled.	CHITCHAT
I like this orange.	O
Might change up my black lines on here into a fun color, but let's let's first get all the colors and then we want to use.	O
It's too.	O
Blue background black a darker blue.	O
'Cause my background is darker.	O
Weird looking It's like.	CHITCHAT
Is it odd American colors?	CHITCHAT
Oh, I guess not it's more of an orange I think it right away in blue.	O
Uh let's see.	CHITCHAT
They have also been on this like weird.	O
Like tritone kick, but keeping things all within the same family, so like you know different shades of red.	O
Things like that.	CHITCHAT
Analysis let's go down my Rd.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
So this is another home with Fresca that I don't understand why it's happening.	CHITCHAT
But like I thought all these black.	O
Like lines because we you know combined them would re merge them.	O
Would recognize that they're all the same color and it kind of doesn't which is weird.	O
But now that I've.	O
Done this like 1 little bit in like an odd color pink if we go like this blue.	O
And we do it, it'll recognize an kind of paint all of 'em.	O
Let's lose that color in the background for right now.	O
We get real experimental here.	O
Let's get weird.	CHITCHAT
Nice thing is this is like a simple drawing so we can get kind of crazy with it and let it go.	CHITCHAT
I worry about you know.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's creepy it looks like some weird.	CHITCHAT
Ah looks like one of the mutants from Futurama.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be watching that show if you don't excellent show.	CHITCHAT
Highly recommend.	CHITCHAT
Personal favorite.	CHITCHAT
What's happening here hold on hold on?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, now we're getting somewhere.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's pick, a software pink.	O
Bingo.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Kind of dig that.	O
What do you all think?	CHITCHAT
I think it looks dope.	CHITCHAT
Usually the powder Blues and powder pinks they kind of do it for me, but I usually have to have some other colors in there to help it along.	O
But this one, I'm kind of digging.	CHITCHAT
I know you're thinking like what you doing to get rid of it.	CHITCHAT
Nope just making a shadow.	O
New menu there, we go.	O
Alright let's add a pixel brush just to it, you know, add some texture and a whole bunch of cool textures that I really like.	O
But none of them are saved in there.	O

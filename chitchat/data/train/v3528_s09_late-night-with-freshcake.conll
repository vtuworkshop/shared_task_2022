Let's see all those are my favorites.	CHITCHAT
Where are my manga ones or manga?	CHITCHAT
Or, however, you say it unless you know comics now?	CHITCHAT
There we go down the bottom let's grab.	O
Action lines Oh yeah, these are kind of cool.	O
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
There you go just adds a little something to it, you know.	O
Go here take it a little bit.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, let's do this duplicate this layer.	O
Go here.	O
Get the color white.	O
Get the paint bucket filling your dude.	O
And let's go to click here and click mask layer contents.	O
Convert it over to pixel layer because we want this to be would have amassed player.	O
So we can draw on it, and not have our drawing go outside the mask.	O
So swipe it over to the right.	O
It go here transfer mode and hit multiply.	O
OO now we got like a darker kind of purple to from that.	O
'Cause the Blues are you know it's the blend mode, it's kind of neat.	O
And let's go here and here you know what let's.	O
Let's hide this really quick let's get this color.	O
As we need it turned it back on.	O
And let's.	CHITCHAT
Let's grab.	O
Let's grab dumbbell.	O
So let's just pulling a nice kind of I don't know have Tony texture on this guys face.	O
Just kind of get some grit.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Little finicky like it.	O
So again the the way that I'm able to do this is 'cause of that blend mode that I just selected.	O
That kind of ads like a little bit of A.	O
Let's turn down the Opacity.	O
Because it's just the ability to add some detail.	O
And with clean up in the I don't know if I.	O
Let's go back go back go back go back.	O
And go back with more.	O
Way back to before.	O
There we go.	O
Let's go through the ice covered the teeth.	O
Now let's do it.	O
Best web content convert.	CHITCHAT
So the reason why I went back just now like that is because I wanted to.	CHITCHAT
I want to poop.	CHITCHAT
Remove.	O
Go ahead and remove all the teeth.	O
I want to create a mask layer.	O
I don't want it on the eyes are the teeth.	O
So I'm going to remove those sections of color, so that when I create them.	O
It identifies that just the areas that are filled in.	O
Now we want to hear blend mode multiply.	O
And we grab our pixel brush, which we already have selected.	O
And we're going to paint the texture back in something.	O
So just kind of lightly touching here.	O
Too much pressure it's very sensitive.	O
I just want like a light texture.	O
I want to do too much.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of grit, it up a little bit.	O
Make a new layer let's see I'm going to layer grab.	O
Color you like.	O
I'm gonna grab this blue because I'm going to make shadows.	O
So new layer.	O
Turn down the opacity too.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
And grab power vector brush.	O
Painting some shadows.	O
That.	CHITCHAT
Both teeth on the I.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to turn it down little bit more.	O
Just a little bit so little shadow nothing crazy, maybe too much too low.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Maple it in the year.	CHITCHAT
Why did the natural thought I had the paint bucket selected shoot?	O

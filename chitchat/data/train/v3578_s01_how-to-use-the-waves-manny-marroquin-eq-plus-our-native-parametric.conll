He over here on Twitter Periscope.	CHITCHAT
We've got Daniel Barack told as an 83 Michael.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for joining.	CHITCHAT
So let's go ahead and get right started and then I'll take questions at the end is always and.	CHITCHAT
Hello Thomas and Hello Daniel when I put my headphones on here as well so that I can actually hear what you're hearing.	CHITCHAT
I would probably good idea to switch my screen over.	CHITCHAT
I need to make a couple more tweaks to this.	CHITCHAT
I forgot to reset.	CHITCHAT
My screen shape that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I'm going to bring a couple of these things up here all right.	CHITCHAT
This should be good enough.	CHITCHAT
Is like that alright so we're going to start?	O
By using this equalizer on a mixed drum track or a drum bus.	O
ASN, 83.	O
Love you from my run a thank you very much right back at you, my friend.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for watching.	CHITCHAT
Uhm you might say well, I don't mix drums.	O
I do video.	O
It's dialogue and maybe a music track or you know, I don't do.	O
Music OK.	O
Understood the reason for showing it on something like drums is twofold one because a drum kit a stereo mix drum kit.	O
Kind of embodies a very broad frequency spectrum right you have the kick drum, which really that's where all of your low end.	O
Sub.	CHITCHAT
Right that's where all that exists so in a whether you're talking LFE for film in a 5.	O
One mix or just sort of low end sound for sound design.	O
Got your kick drum you have your floor.	O
Toms even some of your rack.	O
Toms tend to have a lot of that nice warm low end.	O
And then of course, the snare drum itself very broad spectrum of frequencies that it covers the fundamental sort of.	O
The fatness happens at around 1:50, one 35 Hertz.	O
But the crack of the snare that and that's kind of what gives you that attack and what really makes you feel that hit.	O
That actually exists in the 233 and a half K Range and then of course, you have.	O
Symbols hi hats crash Cymbals Ride Cymbals and those can cover a very broad spectrum, depending upon what type in what?	O
Those you're using now this particular kit is using some new and vintage symbols so you're going to have some of the?	O
Sort of upper mids and highs and then some extreme highs with things like a ping ride that really cover at.	O
Anywhere from say 5K all the way up to 16 K and beyond so drums are just kind of a good idea to allow just the.	O
Average listeners to hear how this simple EQ can really lift.	O
Attract that sounding a bit dead or just maybe a bit flat and kind of give it some life give it a little bit.	O
Air and also give it a little bit more space.	O
That's kind of the key always when equalizing right.	O
If you're trying to carve out space in the mix to allow vocals and dialogue to sit to allow music to allow sound design to allow.	O
Incidental underscored permeate it's all about carving out space and this plugin really allows you to do that brilliantly.	O
So this is from the track that I've been playing the last couple of streams here.	CHITCHAT
It's a cover of mine, which may get released one of these days.	CHITCHAT
And it's a cover that I'm doing rather well cover of mine an here's kind of the flat drums as they exist right now take a quick listen.	O
OK, so they sound OK, they don't sound bad, but they're just they're just a little flat and I'd like to kind of.	O
Bring it together kind of bring out a little bit more of the harmonics and the tonality of this kit to really kind of resonate.	O
I'm going to come up to my track here and I've got everything bust to a group here to its own drum bus.	O
I've also got some global compression already applied and curiously a little bit of ambient reverb.	O
Normally, I wouldn't put reverb on the bus like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to leave it as it is.	O
It's really just for reflection and ambiance.	O
And we're going to add the queue after that, OK, so come up to the insert here.	O
Now the many American EQ is available as VST&AU as well.	O
Both versions get installed should you purchased.	O
Said plug in and I'm going to use the AU version here.	O
And we will find it in the list right here.	O
You'll also get a mono and stereo version, an will go into the mono one.	O
A little bit later when I'm showing how to use it for some dialogue and voice over so we have the stereo version.	O
Play sit here and here's what it looks like again really simple clean interface.	O
If you've looked at our parametric EQ.	O
It's not totally unlike that this isn't technically a fully sweepable parametric.	O
But you know similar functionality high pass and low pass filters.	O
You've got 4 bands affectively you've got a	O
Shelving Abell option on band four which accounts for all of your highs.	O

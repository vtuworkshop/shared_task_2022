You got your input setting your input level, so the set the?	O
Input of the track going into this effect, sometimes you need to attenuate that if the signal is a little too hot, so that you don't clip.	O
And then the output of the effect as well as a phase invert on the effect itself now.	O
Again, most of these plugins from waves tend to have that of course in audition you also have phase invert.	O
On the individual tracks as well, OK and then you've got some nice presets also to get you started and I'd like to point those out just because.	O
Ugly you're just trying to figure out where do I even begin now most of these are of course music related but?	O
If you're looking for a way to try and add some EQ to say a voice over some dialogue.	O
You can try some of these lead vocal you know, bright vocal presets.	O
They just might kind of dial in and get you started.	O
And when you listen to it against everything else.	O
You think, OK that kind of works all right now.	O
You mentioned what's really cool about this is that this is actually made up of multiple eqs Annie cube modules from?	O
Many different consoles.	O
You've got an SSL 980 Gotta Motown console Gotta Neve 1073 a quad 8.	O
There's an API console as well, and and Avalon 2055 for those highs for that the high band Band #4.	O
So each of these has a very unique sound each of these can be used together and this is partly why this one is so good.	O
For mixing for video because what tends to happen with a lot of EQ even our own parametric.	O
If you're using that same EQ on multiple things.	O
They all start to have kind of a very similar sound.	O
This one because the nature of it has literally 6 different modules all contained in this one plugin.	O
It just gives a really unique color a really unique flavor to your audio and no matter how you use it or how many of you use?	O
Everything is going to sound a little bit unique and have its own space.	O
Alright so when we listen to these drums.	O
You know, and there's lots of different ways to think about Equalizing.	O
You know in general.	CHITCHAT
I tend to look for things that I want to boost.	O
But I'm also always listening for stuff that's wrong that I want to cut or maybe that's annoying like a ring.	O
Or if there's too much boom or too much warmth.	O
On the surface with this one, I want to start by just adding.	O
A little bit of.	O
Just a little bit a little bit of brightening a little bit of kind of just making that snare crack a little more.	O
Kind of opening up some of the midrange alright, so we're going to start with this band 3 now.	O
Each of these can be enabled or disabled and actually even before I get to that let's talk about.	O
The high pass and low pass.	O
These are really commonly used filters, particularly with things like voice over right so.	O
Just for those of you unfamiliar so a high pass filter high pass equals low cut alright low pass.	O
Equals high cut so with a high pass filter and this is a fully sweepable filter from zero to 750 Hertz.	O
What that does is it will effectively filter off the low end at a very steep curve so for things like dialogue.	O
You typically don't want dialogue to have a frequency range or any kind of stuff happening at the 40 Hertz range.	O
Or even necessarily really around 70 not not really, for film, if it's just a straight voice over or you're doing a book on tape.	O
Book a digital book, maybe but in general, probably not an in fact, many studios when you're tracking voice over.	O
Lot of the microphones, including the one that I'm using here will tend to have.	O
A roll off like in fact, this particular audio Technica has a bass roll off at 80 Hertz so it.	O
Automatically applies a high pass filter to cut off, Baker and that bass frequencies below 80 right now, I can show that to you.	O
While this is playing here and just kind of let you hear what that sounds like.	O
Not super dramatic on drums, but you'll get the idea.	O
You can see it's starting to thin out.	O
Sorry my bad mouse is freaking.	CHITCHAT
Right we can bring that bass back in.	O
And then of course, the opposite of that is a low pass high cut now this is really commonly used.	O
In pretty much all.	O
All EDM and a lot of sort of modern pop music where you tend to have those sections in the song where you still hear the beep, but everything is kind of.	O
Muffled and then you slowly start to hear and then suddenly, it's full program again.	O
Now, this particular low pass.	O
Only has a cut off starting at around 1.8 kilohertz.	O

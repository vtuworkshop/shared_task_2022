So to get that full like you actually need this to go a bit lower.	O
But let me play this for you and you'll hear exactly what I'm talking about alright take a listen.	O
Right so right now everything above 1800 Hertz is cut off.	O
And then we can gradually bring it back in.	O
OK, now one of the reasons why I love.	CHITCHAT
These is first of all these are fully sweepable, so you have.	O
All of the incremental values.	O
From 1.8 all the way up to in this case.	O
I think it's 25 K similarly with zero to 750.	O
Now these little notch is that you see here.	O
These are I think these are just designed as some of many sort of go to so if you know.	O
Just want to make sure to you can click on these individually and it's going to go directly to one of those frequencies as opposed to.	O
As you can see here scrubbing through the different values, OK, but what's also really cool about this and you can pretty much do this with?	O
All of the OR at least most of the plugins out there is that you can automate this so.	O
If you wanted to do sort of that pass of the.	O
Remove all the Treble and then gradually bring it back in you can automate that really easily so if I were to come over to the track here.	O
I'm going to write mode alright?	CHITCHAT
What does by the way this works exactly the same way in Premier?	O
When you're in track automation right mode what that means is that anything that you do inside of this effect.	O
While you're playing back.	O
It's basically recording all of your actions so if I start play.	O
And let me make sure at the beginning of the session here, so I have plenty of.	O
Plenty of lead time.	O
When we begin playback.	O
I'm going to start adjusting that low pass filter and then the high pass filter.	O
And you'll See and then we'll play it back and you'll see how it automates those parameters, OK and the same goes for.	O
All the individual EQ gain controls and the frequency selectors as well, so all of this stuff can be automated.	O
Even the input and output to also take a quick listen.	O
Here we going to do high pass sorry low pass 1st and then high pass.	O
Let's bring it back.	O
All right, something like that OK.	CHITCHAT
So now when we play this back, you'll see that it's going to Automate.	O
All of that and it's going to playback.	O
All of those changes that we just made now if I twirl down.	O
My automation Lane inside of audition here.	O
And I go into show envelopes.	O
All Right This is on that drum bus if I go to the many American stereo.	O
EQ this now shows you all the various parameters that are available for automation.	O
And it's going to show you a little asterisk down here at both the high pass and low pass filters.	O
And that's telling me that there were changes that was automation that happened.	O
On those 2 particular controls so if we want to see the envelope.	O
The actual automation of the high pass filter.	O
And go ahead and turn this on and now you can see all the keyframes and by the way you can manually.	O
Adjust this, if you so desire similarly if I come back in here.	O
And go into the low pass you should see that one earlier there.	O
It is different color coding same thing here.	O
OK, so you can see all the various automation and this would this is sort of a good opportunity to even smooth out some of those transitions.	O
You can see like right here, I.	O
Accidentally went all the way down.	O
It's doing it with the mouse is not totally ideal this.	O
The other one has a bunch of zig zag movement in there.	O
But as we wind back.	O
An play if you take a look now.	O
You'll see that this will now of course, playback all about automation take a listen.	O
See it automating the parameters take a look at the but the knobs there.	O
Right now, it goes into the high pass.	O
Start to kill some of that low end.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So fully automatable Real Simple real easy create those kind of effects again this low pass not the best.	O

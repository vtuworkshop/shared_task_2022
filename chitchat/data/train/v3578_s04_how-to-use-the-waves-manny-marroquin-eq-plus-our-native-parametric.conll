Necessarily, for that, but you can get really creative and how you use these things changing the sound overtime.	O
Right so about color timing sound timing, same concept here, you're changing things as things change in the scene.	O
You can automate all of this, you can tweak it after the fact really easilly alright.	O
Let's go ahead and erase that automation, we don't need that.	O
Do the same thing for this one here.	O
Alright so race it.	O
Cool, OK, I will go back into just read mode, OK alright.	O
So now we're going to get into the actual.	O
Sort of EQ part of it, so I mentioned the crack of the snare.	O
The fundamental of a snare is approximately 3.23 point, 5K this of course, can vary depending on the type of snare.	O
Metal would the type of head, but generally when you want to really emphasize that to really make it cut through.	O
You're going to find that somewhere between again 3, two and a half to 4K now this particular frequency 3.	O
Has 1.632 and 5, so 3.2 is really where I want to be?	O
And as I start raising the gain here, you're just going to notice that it's really going to start to not only lift up the snare.	O
But the Toms and some of the other elements are going to feel more of the drums you're going to your.	O
Literally going to feel and almost you can smell the presence of the kit as we accentuate this alright so let's start.	O
Let's take a listen.	O
Starting a little bright and pull it back a little.	O
And we can also cut at 3.2.	O
And it's nice and it's warm but again, it's feels like it's a little covered.	O
OK, now one of the reasons that I keep my frequency analysis open at all times that I love to be able to see.	O
Very clean and clear delineation between kick and snare hits right and ideally what you want to see on a frequency analysis that you should see the kick when the kick goes up.	O
There should be a dip at around say 100 Hertz, the kick should really be focused around somewhere.	O
It depends on the type of kick the size of the kick how it's Mike but generally somewhere between.	O
Say 55 and 75, should be that fundamental hit of the kick that's jumping on your frequency analysis.	O
And then you're going to see that fundamental of the snare again that the fat.	O
Around 150 or so.	O
200 give or take so you want to see a little dip in there now, what I'm listening back there's a little bit of extra warmth.	O
That I just want to attenuate slightly now because you have this mixture of different E QS in here.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
You can do this without again, creating these weird fasy type artifacts and it just sounds unbelievably warm and musical.	O
So I'm going to keep band 3.	O
We're not even going to use this high one just going to turn off frequency band 2.	O
And now we're going to focus here on band One now again 140 Hertz that's kind of that fat.	O
Attack of the snare so I don't want to kill that but looking and listening.	O
I'm hearing a little bit of just.	O
Muddiness right, and it's probably just a little overall bleed from the overhead.	O
Mikes and some of the kick drum in there.	O
We're going to start at 2:20 and I'm going to boost a little bit so you can hear what's going on in there.	O
And then I'll cut and we probably only need to cut.	O
ADB and a half or so alright so take a listen here, we go.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I've got the high.	CHITCHAT
The high pass is still in there?	O
Why is that still automating?	CHITCHAT
Hold on one second.	CHITCHAT
Turn off the automation that will not happen OK.	O
OK so let's kill the EQ.	O
So here's no EQ.	O
I got what kind of flat, let's kick it in.	O

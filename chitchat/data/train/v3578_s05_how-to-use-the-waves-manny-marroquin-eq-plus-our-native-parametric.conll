Off.	O
On.	O
All right and again if you're watching those meters.	O
There's a really clear.	CHITCHAT
There's clear definition of the kick in the snare in the Toms and everything is just.	O
It's just opened up now.	O
I don't think this needs any real high end, but again this one in particular.	O
Is using these Avalon eqs for the high band here 10K to 25K and if you want to add?	O
And overall lift to your mix and this is something that I find a lot of customers asked me about.	O
You finish the mix in Premier.	O
An everything is good, but it just it just needs it needs it needs something at the Top it needs.	O
Air it needs to breathe.	O
If you add 20 or 25 K and you'll see that down here on the frequency band.	O
Or you have a Bell style curve or a shelving curve again, the Bell style curve is going to affect.	O
Adjacent frequencies you can't adjust the bandwidth.	O
It's pre selected.	O
But that's fine.	O
It's done in a musical way.	O
The shelving filter is just going to increase from whatever your control point is in this case 20K.	O
An up right so typically if you want to lift and add a bit of air you're going to use something like a shelving filter.	O
So let's go ahead and go to shelving and I'm just going to start lifting it around 20 K now.	O
25K in particular.	O
Few humans can hear 25 K Anne frankly, she start to get older.	O
Post 40 if you can hear above 20 K right so a lot of that is perception, but you do perceive it, it does create that.	O
Airy Spacey kind of feeling again.	O
It just kind of brightens the environment without making it harsh now.	O
If you increase a lot at 10K.	O
And I'll play that for you.	O
It's going to start to get kind of brittle this doesn't need it.	O
There's plenty of 10K in there already.	O
But twenty K25K it's going to give you this little bit of lift a little bit of.	O
Air and again, it's almost going to feel like you have more dynamic range used subtly alright so first let's start with 10.	O
This is what we don't want but just listen to what 10K does OK.	O
It's still musical so it's not going to make it harsh but.	O
We don't need it, it's bright enough take a listen here.	O
I mean, it doesn't sound bad, but again.	O
It doesn't need that range, but if I go to 20.	O
K now and now I increase.	O
This this might be a little hard to hear over the stream because I don't know.	O
It's being broadcast over it at 48 K so theoretically you're getting up to a 24K limit.	O
But you're going to see if you're listening with cans or on a nice pair of speakers.	O
It just adds a little bit of.	O
Airiness take a listen here.	O
Just a little wider let's turn it off.	O
Let's kick it in.	O
OK and again, sometimes a lot of that is just perception.	O
But if your mixes sounding good and you're happy with it, but you just want to get a little bit of a lift.	O
On Top without increasing high crunchy nastiness.	O
This filter frequency 4.	O
Even 15 or they gotta be careful at 15, but twenty twenty five K32 to 5DB.	O
It's just going to give you a beautiful lift and just a real nice area quality and I love using it just for that.	O
OK, now a couple of other cool things that you can do in here we talked about automating.	O
Many of you have probably worked in audition know that if you start manipulating affects parameters so let's just say we did something like this.	O
And you start doing stuff and you forget what it was was it on minus 2 before and I just moved it to minus 8.	O
I don't remember.	CHITCHAT
Well, if you go to undo.	O
Undo.	O
Doesn't respect manipulations of parameters?	O
Don't affect the undo menu so you're kind of out of luck?	O
There, however.	O
You can undo directly inside of the effect itself, so here's your undo redo so if we just made that adjustment here if I simply click.	O
Undo it goes back to the last state.	O
Undo it will go back to the state before that.	O
Undo will go back to the state before that.	O
Undo it goes back to the state before that, so you have undo and redo contained in the effect here, which again is.	O
Is really useful?	O
I really love that ability because I've been guilty of it myself or if I'm working in some of our native plugins.	O
And I move something a couple DB and I want to what was it before.	O

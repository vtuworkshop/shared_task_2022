Can't quite do it, so this has undo and redo built into the effect also you've also got a wonderful feature.	O
In the form of an A minus a be listening.	O
So this allows you to toggle between different settings.	O
So let's say I wanted to hear this version and you'll notice that there isn't a section up here.	O
If I click this, this now goes to your be so you have A&B now typically what I might want to do.	O
Is have 2 completely different presets so let's go to something like I think I have?	O
And we can just go to one of these just random presets in here.	O
OK let's just go to overheads.	O
This is probably going to sound pretty bright so here's the EQ that we just created.	O
We're happy with this.	CHITCHAT
But we want to hear this other EQ here we go ready.	O
And we can change this too.	O
Let's go back to A.	O
B.	O
OK, now, what, if I would like to take a Copy it over to be and then tweak just that one setting like Alright How about no error but.	O
No attenuation at 2:20.	O
So you'll notice that there's a little button in here that has an A with an arrow going towards be.	O
That means copy A to be so when I click on that.	O
What you'll see now is that A&B's I'm toggling between them have exactly the same settings?	O
So now in BI can actually disable the air.	O
And let's say, Let's.	CHITCHAT
Do only a half a DB of a cut at 2:20, so we can start with.	O
The original eh.	O
And now let's go to be.	O
Hey.	O
E.	CHITCHAT
Hey.	CHITCHAT
OK, so really easy way to toggle between A&B.	O
Very effectively now once you start doing this, you might say OK.	O
I want to create a preset.	O
What's the best way to do it?	O
Well, this is where things can sometimes get tricky with 3rd party presets.	O
An audition, especially because you're probably wanting to simply come up here and create a preset and you can do that.	O
The only problem is that that creates a preset.	O
That is native only to this session on this effect if you want a preset that you're going to be able to use in any session on any project.	O
You're going to want to save it from the menu here and in this case you're going to say put.	O
Into preset menu as so if you choose that.	O
And you give your preset a name and it does create an audition preset, but this allows you to use it.	O
Anywhere in audition.	O
Do so do whatever it is, and then when you go into the load menu.	O
You'll see at the bottom.	O
This is where your user presets are contained and you can actually see that I made 1 here called.	O
Am I a drum bus, so if we go ahead and select that.	O
OK turns that on this is the one that I wound up using?	O
Now I can a be this?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think I might even cut this back a little bit so.	O
Saving and loading presets copy and pasting a be listening between 2 completely different settings undo redo sweepable bands.	O
Highpass lowpass automation really cool really simple and I'm going to Uber example of this on voice in just a second.	O
I wanted to also talk about our native parametric EQ because this is again different and this allows you.	O
Or to have very clinical control, but you need to, you need to be a little more mindful and you need to kind of study and work with EQ a bit more before you die very deep.	O
Into our parametric because it is pretty complex but.	O
Mind you very nice sounding very warm sounding and very clean, sounding so when I'm listening to the snare drum here.	O
I was hearing that there's a little bit of a little bit of a ring.	O
Alright so take out take a listen to this.	O
OK, so it's It's subtle but it's bothering me a little bit so this is where because you have variable bandwidth control here, you can get very specific.	O

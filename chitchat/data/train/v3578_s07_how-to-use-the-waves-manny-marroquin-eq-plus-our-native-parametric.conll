And if you can hear what it is that you're trying to attenuate or to soften or to boost.	O
You can identify it and pull it out with a very, very narrow band so we're going to start.	O
I'm guessing it sounds and again looking at it here.	O
It's somewhere in the low 2 hundreds, which again is about.	O
70 to 90 Hertz away from that fundamental fat hit of the snare zero.	O
It is it's something in the head.	O
That's ringing so we're going to use band #2 here.	O
And I'm going to set a very, very narrow.	O
Q Value of around 14 again this is your bandwidth and just to illustrate that this is a Q Value of 2.	O
And you can see that it looks like again.	O
It's kind of like that, Bell curve, but as you.	O
Adjust.	O
Higher values it's very, very narrow and the more narrow your band.	O
The fewer adjacent frequencies.	O
You'll be adversely affecting by boosting or cutting.	O
So with the Q Value of say, 14 this is very, very narrow, so this is really for clinical.	O
Attenuation of things like a snare ring so if I play this back now.	O
I'm going to sweep this.	O
It's around, it's around like 2, two 10 to 20.	O
Let's take a listen.	O
Whoops sorry whose 1st?	CHITCHAT
By the way there was an update to audition today and I've noticed that since doing that.	O
It's sometimes.	CHITCHAT
I'm not seeing the the you I just went away.	O
So I have to report this to them later or not.	O
We're not seeing the curve anymore, but in any case.	O
So we're going to drop this around 6, 1/2, DB and then we're going to come up about 100 Hertz higher.	O
To Round 300, Let's do around say 302.	O
Going to use an even narrower band here and you're on 18.	O
And we're going to do a similar cut.	O
All right.	O
So before.	O
After.	O
And we just got rid of that little bit of that.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Suddenly notice because these are so narrow were still letting.	O
You know 225 to 290.	O
Get in there, but we're pulling out a couple of those frequencies that are causing a bit of that a bit of that ring that just I wasn't loving OK.	O
And now when we bring everything else back into the kit.	O
It's real clean so again just to kind of showcase everything.	O
Here's our before with no EQ and also no compression in this case.	O
Alright and now let's turn on our work.	O
OK.	O
It just feel it's just really opens everything up right and then when you start to add some of the other instrumentation in here now.	O
This isn't perfectly mixed, but you'll get the idea.	O
Super clean all right, so that showcasing that on some drums showing off the stereo variation alright so let's go into.	O

Uh.	CHITCHAT
Little bit of mono usage here, so this is a voice over that I did for one of our.	O
NABRIBC videos announcing some new motion graphics template features and this is just a straight voice over into this very microphone.	O
There's no EQ there's no compression.	O
But I just want to give it just a little bit of again just kind of bring out the voice a little bit more.	O
And do it very, very musically right, so first let's take a listen to the clean on touched version.	O
Simply drag and drop spreadsheets to create infographics using motion graphics templates.	O
Any updates today to are automatically updated in the infographic.	O
Responsive design time is now available in after effects so you can create motion graphics that can adapt to changes in length.	O
While preserving the integrity of keyframes OK, so it sounds good.	O
I just I just think it needs it needs a little bit of maybe a little bit of shimmer, but just again.	O
The voice just needs to be a little more sparkly it needs to come out a little bit more.	O
And perhaps very subtly attenuates some of the low end.	O
I have a lot of low frequency in my voice so.	O
It might just be a slight a tad bit too, warm, especially if there's going to be music underneath it.	O
So for this again, I can add the many American Mono to the effects rack or I can run it.	O
Immediately destructively from the effects menu here.	O
So to keep it non destructive until we process.	O
Let's go ahead and add it from here.	O
Into the effects rack.	O
I'll grab the mono version OK.	O
Anne will reset lips will reset this full reset.	O
And take it.	O
Excuse me take a listen now.	O
In terms of vocals in terms of voice dialogue couple key frequencies to keep in mind now again.	O
You've got a lot of mid range in your voice you got a lot of.	O
Low and low mid fundamentals.	O
And when you start to get into the higher frequencies, particularly three five and 8K.	O
There's some very specific things that happen, there, so 3 to 4K.	O
This tends to be a very nice pleasing intelligence range, you can really intelligently here.	O
What's going on if you increase those frequency range is now 5, K 5K to 7K is where you can incur.	O
Sibilance that's where you can start to really boost.	O
The fundamentals of those harsh sounds depending upon who did the voice over in what they were.	O
And what they were speaking on you want to be careful around that range.	O
But in 8K.	O
This is where you start to add shimmer so not unlike what I just showed you with giving that.	O
Airlift on the overall mix.	O
8K on a single voice over can sometimes just give it a little bit of this.	O
It's just it's just a little bit of shimmer a little bit of sparkle without making it sound crunchy and bright.	O
And again the nature of the curve of this particular frequency and on this one.	O
That I write I wrote it down in what is the I think?	CHITCHAT
This isn't the Motown EQ.	O
This is I think this is an Eve 1073.	O
It's kind of hard to mess this up, but you'll hear different results.	O
As you approach so let's go ahead and start with this.	O
And I'll start increasing at 3.2 and you'll kind of here what that does and it's pretty nice.	O

OK, off responsive design time is now available in after effects so you can create motion graphics that can adapt to changes in length.	O
While preserving the integrity of keyframes OK, so you can hear it kind of gives you again sort of those.	O
It's that it's mids, not high mids kind of mid mid's right, maybe a little crunchy.	O
But still pretty good.	O
Let's listen to 5K now and here with that does all right.	O

OK, now that one that one seems to be doing it.	O
For me because my voice in this case.	O
There's a lot of warmth in there.	O
And I don't want to accentuate that 3K there's plenty of that already.	O
But that 5K range actually because it's not sibilant.	O
It's giving me just a little bit of that nice detail in that 56 K range, OK, so 5K kind of actually works for me here.	O
But let's go to 8K now and listen to what that one does in the Infographic.	O
Responsive design time is now available in after effects so you can create motion graphics that can adapt to changes in length.	O
Observing the integrity of keyframes turn it off simply drag and drop spreadsheets to create infographics using motion graphics templates.	O

Responsive design time is now available in after effects alright so I think if I use 8K and what have I got about 3 1/2 DB here?	O

Yeah, 3.6, I'm now going to come over to the.	O
Let's see it sounds it sounds like it's kind of in the 140 range, but it could be.	O
Let me take a listen so you can create motion graphics that can adapt to changes in length while preserving the integrity of keyframes.	O
Yeah, so I'm just going to cut ever so slightly at around 1:40 about a half a DB.	O
And let's take a listen now and I'll turn the whole effect off 1st and then I'll turn it back on here we go.	O

Responsive design time is now available in after effects so you can create motion graphics that can adapt to changes in length.	O
While preserving the integrity of keyframes OK, so you can hear it.	O
When I say keyframes just has this.	O
There's this little shimmer right.	O
It's not sibilance again.	O
It could potentially get a little sibling around 5K.	O
Because this has the notch at 5K.	O
Technically sibilance starts at around 5.66 point, three is where you tend tend to hit that kind of really harsh fundamental.	O
So again, they did a really good thing with this musically.	O
Unless you're prone to sibilance you've got something that siblings are going to be careful in that range.	O
It actually worked on this vocal too, but 8K kind of gives it a nice little little little bit of lift.	O
And just by cutting a little bit of those low frequencies.	O
The 1:40 I've already got enough low end in there.	O
And things can get really just they can get cloudy between 1:40 and 200, particularly if it's just voice so you want to be mindful and this is where you really want to have a good, solid listening environment.	O
Be able to play this back in different places to kind of audition with the whole thing is going to sound like.	O
But right away, I mean, it just sounds really nice.	O
Now, if I didn't use this 8K.	O
Let's say we wanted to just give this thing a lift.	O
Let's do let's do 12 and a half OK and see what this one does it take a quick listen?	O
Simply drag and drop spreadsheets to create infographics using motion graphics templates.	O
Any updates today to are automatically updated in the infographic.	O
Responsive design time is now available in after effects so you can create motion graphics and see if you're listening with.	O
Why I wouldn't use twelve five on this is because again the vocal is already bright it's already present?	O
12.	O
Five is it's just it's a little it's.	O
It's still very much in the range that almost all people can hear pretty much everyone unless you have in curd hearing loss and frequency loss.	O
And by increasing this in this case around 5.	O
DB it's starting to get a little brittle right because it's also accentuating some of that.	O
Some of that 10K I've got it on Bell curve here and or in and around 10:11 K.	O
And it just doesn't need it so it starts to sound thin right versus if we went to something like 20.	O
Anne just gave it a little bit of a lift an for that as mentioned, we would use that shelving variation here.	O
Let's do a shelf at around 20 that can adapt to changes in length while preserving the integrity of keyframes.	O

Any updates today to are So what I wound up doing was turning back on the 8K Band.	O
Dropping it down to around 2, 1/2, DB I added a little bit of air.	O
3D be at 20 K and then cut 140 by about .7 D be alright and it just kind of lifted the voice up.	O
It just makes it sound wonderfully present without without harshness without being too thin just the right amount of.	O
Basin warmth with the right amount of clarity and high-end alright and that's thanks to this EQ again, having these fixed.	O
Bandwidths sometimes it's a wonderful thing.	O
This is my go to for voice is this is my go to for bust mixes generally again to give things a little bit of a lift or to do some subtle cuts.	O
It's available from waves com right now like I said, I think it's still on sale for around 29 USD dollars.	O
If you're struggling with EQ if you don't like the sound of some of our native ones.	O
If you're looking for a plugin that just kind of has some great ways to get started an lots of cool features.	O
One to get started with all right, and that my friends is the many American EQO for last couple of minutes here going to take some questions if we've got any.	CHITCHAT
Move over to the chats.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what we've got in here.	CHITCHAT
All right, Bruce Arveson Hello, Pradeep, Leroux.	CHITCHAT

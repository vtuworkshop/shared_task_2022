Stacy is there a list of what I'm teaching and when actually know ask that a lot if you're still watching but no.	CHITCHAT
You know, these are I keep them live on purpose.	CHITCHAT
and I just tend to kind of field what I'm doing by looking at.	CHITCHAT
Twitter comments and stuff that I have written down.	CHITCHAT
But if you've got something that you want to see.	CHITCHAT
Uhm let me know when I can.	CHITCHAT
I can stream on that Thomas Christensen does audition have curves for the automation like dogs, OK, yeah, so I'm guessing you saw that that was earlier when I was showing that.	CHITCHAT

Alright Thomas, it so 11:38 PM, there yet or 10:38 PM sorry.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much of course, you'll be able to watch the replay of this.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Alright say see again I always, I don't use auditions complicated, but I use premiere pro and always have a problem with consistent.	O
Audio output.	O
Not sure how the level should be with music voice and voice over it love to see a segment on that mixing down to a master.	O
Absolutely and I've actually streamed on this a bunch of times later in the week.	CHITCHAT
I actually will be showing just that in fact.	CHITCHAT
Uh today's Tuesday maybe.	CHITCHAT
Maybe Friday, I'll do that, if you'd like the key isn't it depends on what you're doing right.	CHITCHAT
So we have a lot of tools to make that easier for you.	O
That's why we have things like auto ducking.	O
But remember that, if you're delivering content today mixed final content.	O
Part of the key of gluing all of that together so you're talking about consistency in the output is knowing how to apply a proper compressor limiter.	O
You can use something like a brick wall limiter to just kind of prevent peaks from getting out of range.	O
But a lot of times that involves grouping and subgrouping all the dialogue to control to make sure that it is all the same relative level.	O
So there's a lot of things involved there and it's a pretty deep process.	O
I've actually got a whole series.	CHITCHAT
On YouTube called how to make great videos and there are several passages in there that are chapter ized.	CHITCHAT
Talk about mixing a full track.	CHITCHAT
I also have an audio 101 series in there and those of you watching on YouTube already know.	CHITCHAT
But I'm putting it in the chat here in on Facebook Stacy so you can go and check those out.	CHITCHAT
And you might be able to find what you're looking for and again.	CHITCHAT
The How To make great video series.	CHITCHAT
They're all chapter eyes, so you can skip around and find what you're looking for.	CHITCHAT

That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yes, and that's exactly what I'm talking about when I was just referencing with Stacy too.	CHITCHAT
Uhm it's an essential part of that final delivery in that final glue.	CHITCHAT

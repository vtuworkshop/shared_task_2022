And so now here to sell anything under saying that's the proof.	CHITCHAT
Into what I'm saying until I'm about.	CHITCHAT
And so here we go?	CHITCHAT
I know what to do here.	CHITCHAT
And so I did that I was the creative genius, an it worked.	CHITCHAT
Nobody has ever thought about that part.	CHITCHAT
But Oh yeah, but there was too many letters the TH E creative genius.	CHITCHAT
And so I think it was like 1 complete.	CHITCHAT
Character over.	CHITCHAT
So I said, well what if I take make THC into.	CHITCHAT
DA.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
The creative genius.	CHITCHAT
And it worked, so I went with it and ever since then, I've been the creative genius.	CHITCHAT
And I've used it.	CHITCHAT
I've used it as a title of use it as a name.	CHITCHAT
I created a lot of profiles that was on.	CHITCHAT

And it works well for me.	CHITCHAT
So when I got my Behance.	CHITCHAT
And I will start creative genius that is still my email address.	CHITCHAT
And my website creative genius, but as science going on my.	CHITCHAT
My name is Delta TM that has a whole another story.	CHITCHAT
I'll talk about in a little bit.	CHITCHAT
But that is a whole another story in itself and.	CHITCHAT
And so I'm my identity on line.	CHITCHAT
Is in in real life as an artist?	CHITCHAT

DTM or DTM.	CHITCHAT
But my title.	CHITCHAT
As a creative person in the value that I bring to my clients.	CHITCHAT
It's Is that creative genius?	CHITCHAT
So, there, you go.	CHITCHAT
It asked it started with.	CHITCHAT
Be in my title dot creative genius and then I can't get the email address that I want because everybody has.	CHITCHAT
Because everybody has my regular name Daniel Flores and I'm sure there's a bunch of them and I do follow a few of them.	CHITCHAT
Here and there.	CHITCHAT
Google tells me about them.	CHITCHAT
But at the end of the day, it has to do.	CHITCHAT
With.	CHITCHAT
It has to do with.	CHITCHAT
Having to cut back a letter and then then that became one of my tags.	CHITCHAT
So they have it now, you know something about me.	CHITCHAT
And now it's your job to tell me about yourself.	CHITCHAT
What's going on with you?	CHITCHAT
What are you talking about?	CHITCHAT
What are you working on?	CHITCHAT
Why?	CHITCHAT
And as to why?	CHITCHAT
Because a lot of times artists were very creative people.	CHITCHAT
You know that's why we're artists as we creative.	CHITCHAT
We want to try things we want to do things.	CHITCHAT
But we are not sure why we do it.	CHITCHAT
And you always get ideas that well if I do this, then that's going to happen and this happened.	CHITCHAT
And other times, that's not how it goes.	CHITCHAT
A lot of times we do things because we think it's going to lead to something.	CHITCHAT
And but were unaware that there are other steps that were missing.	CHITCHAT
Or that that is not how you reach those goals.	CHITCHAT
And so that's why it's important to talk to somebody have mentors.	CHITCHAT
I guess this is what is going to talk?	CHITCHAT
We're going to talk about today.	CHITCHAT
Is mentorship who argue mentors?	CHITCHAT
And uh and when you have mentors.	CHITCHAT
They sit down with him and ask you why you doing that.	CHITCHAT
And is that the best option is there is that the best.	CHITCHAT
Step to take an as you having the discussion.	CHITCHAT
You start having really says Little.	CHITCHAT
I guess that is not a good idea.	CHITCHAT
And it's not that you're wrong is that you need to talk to somebody.	CHITCHAT
Before, you invest a lot of time and sometimes we are a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
So I want to say hard headed but you know, we get stuck in something and don't want to give it up.	CHITCHAT
Because of what my wife likes to say sunk costs.	CHITCHAT
We've invested so much time into something that eventually you don't want to give it up.	CHITCHAT
You don't want to stop.	CHITCHAT
Or even though it's not going to pan out the way you originally thought because you've already invested a lot of time on it.	CHITCHAT

Kind of like that's why I'm taking my time in working on the pencil's.	CHITCHAT
On this illustration, even though instead of doing now dispenses I could do the vector.	CHITCHAT
But I'm doing depends 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I want to look at it, I want to.	CHITCHAT
Think about this, if this is the best option for what I'm trying to do.	CHITCHAT
Is this the best look?	CHITCHAT
Is this the best layout?	CHITCHAT
Is this going to give me the?	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
The impact.	CHITCHAT
We'll see we'll find out.	CHITCHAT
Stayton.	CHITCHAT
You'll only going to find that out, if you work through the process.	CHITCHAT
Then, if you have a mentor.	CHITCHAT
They can share their process with you they can give you some guidance as to how.	CHITCHAT
To think about these things.	CHITCHAT
How to look at these things?	CHITCHAT
And then you are.	CHITCHAT
You'll be able to.	CHITCHAT
Take advantage of the steps that you're taking and see the fruits of your labor.	CHITCHAT
I spent a lot of time with mentors I have mentors.	CHITCHAT
I talked to my mentors all the time may not see the same mentor every time when I'm having a discussion but I'm definitely.	CHITCHAT
Going to This can have a discussion with somebody about the thoughts some.	CHITCHAT
Mentors are an?	CHITCHAT
Only care about well the artistic vision.	CHITCHAT
What are you trying to say?	CHITCHAT
What does it look like?	CHITCHAT
Is it right does it does it need it?	CHITCHAT
Little bit of extra work other mentors are about how the business was the business behind it as an entrepreneur.	CHITCHAT
And then the last video talking about how been entrepreneur for a long, long time.	CHITCHAT
And I was telling a story about when I was in the marine core and how.	CHITCHAT
I'm I say I was selling T shirts.	CHITCHAT
As the marine core I was a marine and I was going through actually MOS the color down.	CHITCHAT
Military Occupational Specialties, something like that I forget.	CHITCHAT
An so you go to school.	CHITCHAT
They sent Me 2 particular place in the military base somewhere in your cut.	CHITCHAT
That, which your job is going to be about in the marine core.	CHITCHAT
And uh some there to learn I'm there to take classes but.	CHITCHAT
On the weekends and on the evenings.	CHITCHAT
I'm I'm pre selling T shirt designs and then I go in and put it in order for the T shirt.	CHITCHAT
And then turn in the T shirts to different people who pay me for it.	CHITCHAT
And then they go they got their shirts so.	CHITCHAT
Wayne your arm so I've been at Intrapreneur for a long, long time.	CHITCHAT
And that's just one of those stories, but way before that, I grew up with a mom who sold everything.	CHITCHAT
And she sold a Ron, she sold.	CHITCHAT
Uh we go let's go, like that, she sold.	CHITCHAT
Top aware she sold everything I'm telling you I mean, she had it in her house, she needed she need a lot.	CHITCHAT
And so I listened to the sales pitch.	CHITCHAT
I listen to her talk.	CHITCHAT
I saw her stick her nose into places.	CHITCHAT
Then it shouldn't necessarily belonged but she would make friends with people all types of things.	CHITCHAT
And so.	CHITCHAT
That is just something that that kind of naturally took on.	CHITCHAT
And when it came time to be a full time artist, I applied some of those things right always be closing.	CHITCHAT
Always be creating ABC.	CHITCHAT
And so my mentors business mentors.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know those things existed and so I went.	CHITCHAT
When did when I did find out that that was there and they existed?	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
Ours are Lane is like yes, I need more.	CHITCHAT
I need to know more I used on a tattoo shop.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
At the end.	CHITCHAT
When we close it down.	CHITCHAT
I felt like I had reached the end of my knowledge like I did not know how to do.	CHITCHAT
How to go further and I'm looking at these other tattoo shops and tattoo artists and you know they got their 2nd and 3rd.	CHITCHAT
Or an unlikable hug you even manage the first one.	CHITCHAT
I just did not.	CHITCHAT
Had reached at everything that I knew I had done in I did if I wanted to go forward ahead to.	CHITCHAT
Find out more information had to find the people who had that knowledge.	CHITCHAT
And that's where those I did not know that mentors existed, but the more I'm talking to people, the more I'm going to hack phones and.	CHITCHAT

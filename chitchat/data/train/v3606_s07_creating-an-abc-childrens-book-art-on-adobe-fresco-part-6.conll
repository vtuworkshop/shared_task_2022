Hello markers already told you the story about my marker so.	CHITCHAT
Come over other story so let's talk about other things.	CHITCHAT
Anyways one of my other mentors, he's an artist mentor.	CHITCHAT
That guy, he tells me about Um.	CHITCHAT
Tells me his ideas about how my heart.	CHITCHAT
What I could do with my art?	CHITCHAT
And he's always right like that's a good idea like yeah, I should try that.	CHITCHAT
One thing he said, was like you should go bigger.	CHITCHAT
You are worse cool, but you should go bigger, said Alright.	CHITCHAT
He should do a walls as I could and I got Mills.	CHITCHAT
And I went from canvas to bigger canvas to bigger canvas and the oldest.	CHITCHAT
Let's make a mirror out of that and he is the curator of A.	CHITCHAT
Of art exhibit.	CHITCHAT

Business operates.	CHITCHAT
Who can pay your price?	CHITCHAT
Ann what's your creative process that allows you?	CHITCHAT
To create the artwork that people are going to pay you for?	CHITCHAT
Do you have a creative process?	CHITCHAT
You need to have a creative process.	CHITCHAT
Because there are days when you don't feel like drawing.	CHITCHAT

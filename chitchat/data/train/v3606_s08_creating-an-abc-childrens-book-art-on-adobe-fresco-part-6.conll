Spirit in campaign and working in the steel company something wrong with working with steel company I've done it.	CHITCHAT
I just rather sit here and draw and say, Hey, y'all.	CHITCHAT
Figure out how to monetize your drawings.	CHITCHAT

Lay well.	CHITCHAT
For a long time before I got paid to draw I was drawing.	CHITCHAT
For fun and for myself even this project is personal.	CHITCHAT
No one is paying me for this project.	CHITCHAT
But this is an idea that I have that I want to see I want to see it finished.	CHITCHAT
So I'm drawing it, I'm sitting here drawing.	CHITCHAT
And a lot of times only do creative stuff.	CHITCHAT
That's where we sharpen our skills that's where.	CHITCHAT
We tighten up these ideas and they OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to draw this thing that I want to draw.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
And as in that's what you should focus on when you don't have a client when you don't have a our careers.	CHITCHAT
In your light well what should I be doing to find those clients where you should have the body at work.	CHITCHAT

But now degrees now loans either.	CHITCHAT
Never went to college, then went to school.	CHITCHAT
To learn how to draw I did not.	CHITCHAT
My way niceness not necessarily everybody's way 'cause I had to discipline.	CHITCHAT
To sit there and work on stuff until I figured it out.	CHITCHAT
And if you need someone to give you the knowledge and hand it to you.	CHITCHAT
Without you looking it up, but then you need to go to college.	CHITCHAT
Mean when it did not consider colleges.	CHITCHAT
I don't like school.	CHITCHAT
All I said in the classroom.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
And so I was late now there goes that night.	CHITCHAT
Let's say it's cool looks a little dark dress OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's fine.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that one's going to be told yellow.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
And so instead of sitting around the classroom, I said, well let me find the people.	CHITCHAT
Who know how to do this thing?	CHITCHAT
So hung out at drawing sessions and hung out at all.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Adding meetups.	CHITCHAT
Anna said Hey man, let me see your work.	CHITCHAT
And one time the submit my mentor.	CHITCHAT
The artist the one who's a curator.	CHITCHAT
Powers that are drawing session at her, I had heard.	CHITCHAT
And it was strange to me because of course.	CHITCHAT
I didn't know anything about art or drawing.	CHITCHAT
I was in the marine core are and I left.	CHITCHAT
High school went straight to the military.	CHITCHAT
And so on, so here I am in Atlanta, like I want to be an artist.	CHITCHAT
I think had already open my tattoo shop.	CHITCHAT
And so her the artist got together to draw my why.	CHITCHAT
Why do artists get together to draw?	CHITCHAT
What is it that?	CHITCHAT
Makes artist hang out.	CHITCHAT
Well, I went to the look.	CHITCHAT
I show up.	CHITCHAT
I ask an artist Acee artist sitting around drawing and sketching on that wall that's cool man.	CHITCHAT
That's super cool.	CHITCHAT
And then I walked up to an artist, said Hey man, let me see you, your black book your.	CHITCHAT
Portfolio and I got a lot of those books that there's some back there.	CHITCHAT
You see them back there that whole another wall.	CHITCHAT
Over there.	CHITCHAT
And he looked at me and kind of ignored me and I was like what is going on with the?	CHITCHAT
So hang out for a little bit and let you know what these artists like there there mean.	CHITCHAT
And I left.	CHITCHAT
And that whole week I'm thinking about is like you know.	CHITCHAT
Why why why why would that guy next?	CHITCHAT

And I said, I know why.	CHITCHAT
Then bring my own book.	CHITCHAT

So here I am and the first thing I did I walked up to the same guy said Hey man, you know, I saw you last week.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to talk to you for a minute to check out your work.	CHITCHAT
Here's my book.	CHITCHAT
Boom he handed me his.	CHITCHAT
And now I'm looking at his work and of course, he's amazing super talent and light thing.	CHITCHAT
But I'm like, yeah, my problem was, I walked in here, you know just.	CHITCHAT
Just.	CHITCHAT
Nothing to prevent show.	CHITCHAT
Then again, and to prove to me.	CHITCHAT
And and but if I come at them as artist that I am that they are then.	CHITCHAT
Then then I'm going to get a different response.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I forgot where I was going with that story.	CHITCHAT
That's How I Met him.	CHITCHAT
And so that's how I learned that's how I learn I sat down and talked to him.	CHITCHAT
A little bit more.	CHITCHAT
He's been giving me are tips ever since that was an.	CHITCHAT
2002.	CHITCHAT

Follow through with that, you're going to grow into.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
An make it a success.	CHITCHAT
Whatever your definition of success is in all of our definitions are different right.	CHITCHAT
Everybody has different definitions of success.	CHITCHAT
But you need to define yours.	CHITCHAT
And then say I'm going to work towards this goal.	CHITCHAT

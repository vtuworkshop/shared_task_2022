Is the Surface Pro 7?	CHITCHAT
I love it?	CHITCHAT
I enjoy all the surface pros because?	CHITCHAT
It's like a real computer that you can draw on.	CHITCHAT
And anything I can draw on our model in poor alright I am streaming with an app called Cinna Maker.	CHITCHAT
And I have an iPad on one side.	CHITCHAT
It is my directory, I get to see my screen and all the other elements.	CHITCHAT
Including that intro and then I have an iPhone where capturing me an I kind of like videos where you can see the person.	CHITCHAT
That's really my thing, so let me turn this up a little bit so you can see me well.	CHITCHAT
There it is that's good, I like it.	CHITCHAT
Please give me some feedback.	CHITCHAT
Let me know how I'm doing let me know what you think about my life.	CHITCHAT
Let me know what you think about my series, I have a whole series going on right now, it is.	O
Creating.	O
An ABC children's art book.	O
Children's book and I'm creating the art in Adobe fresco.	O
So today is part 5.	O
Let me take this out, I don't need to hear myself twice.	CHITCHAT
And let me go ahead and crank up the music because I do have music.	CHITCHAT
Let me turn that.	CHITCHAT
Of.	CHITCHAT
Boom go here here.	CHITCHAT
And here.	CHITCHAT
I'll keep it low.	CHITCHAT
And let's see how that sounds.	CHITCHAT
He'd been low low.	CHITCHAT
There it is that way when I'm not talking you can hear some cool music.	CHITCHAT
Huh so this drawing right here on myself.	O
Is not the project that is not the project that we're working on right now?	O
Is actually let me go ahead and jump.	O
Out.	O
And to my main screen here in Adobe fresco?	O
Is there some of the projects that I worked on the W fresco here.	O
Inside of the surface, however, if I click on the cloud documents boom.	O
It shows up all the different files that I've worked on in Adobe fresco.	O
On any device so I have 3 iPad pros, they have Adobe fresco.	O
I have 3?	O
UH-6 surface pros, they all have Adobe fresco and I am a hoarder I know.	O
But my point is that?	CHITCHAT
Anytime you working on Adobe fresco.	O
The files will back up to the cloud creative cloud.	O
And then you can open the same file in any one of your different devices.	O
If you have at least more than one.	O
And you can continue working on that file and that's what we're going to do right now.	O
I'm going to go ahead and click on that.	O
ABC you see right there.	O
It takes as its opening is going on to the Internet.	CHITCHAT
I do have my Wi-Fi answer.	CHITCHAT
We're good to go.	CHITCHAT
It's going to take a little while what's going on with my Wi-Fi?	O
It's a pretty large file because I already have a ton of layers going on so let's take a look at what's going on right here.	O
Boom there, it is.	CHITCHAT
So hopefully you've caught some of the other.	CHITCHAT
Let me turn this down so I don't hear feedback.	CHITCHAT
Some of the other.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Live streams on be hands and if you looked at them do you understand?	CHITCHAT
What's going on here if you have not?	CHITCHAT
Let's do a quick look at what's going on.	O
So now right side.	O
We have all our layers.	O
I have the layers icon.	O
Open a click on it, and all the layers could put away on the left hand side or my tools and right now, I'm.	O
I'm sticking with the sketching tool, which is the pencil and that's what I'm drawing with.	O
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Eventually I'll get to the point where we do the vector.	O
Once I start doing the vector drawings, then I'll go ahead and grab.	O
The vector brush.	O
I do have not set this basic round away.	O
I want to just yet.	O
I played around with it.	O
But not is not set for this file just yet.	O
'cause I have an idea what I want but we'll see how it goes once this actually start drawing.	O
That vector brushes it's important to me to drawing vector because I want to be able to use these letters individually.	O
And together in different projects that idea right now is to do a children's book this ABC.	O
But you never know I have this.	O
Feeling that maybe I want to have this.	O
These letters individually.	O
Ask Yes, Sally Sally's when you're trying to do something that people can see you.	CHITCHAT
I want to be able to use these letters individually.	O
In different projects shares.	O
Posters other books, whatever an so by them by me, finishing them up on Vector.	O
I'll be able to use these files in other ways beyond just the printed book or just beyond the web.	O
When you're working in pixel.	O
Art like the pencil brushes.	O
Over these traditional brushes.	O

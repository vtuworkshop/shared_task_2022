Then you'll get these pixelation and that's not good to translate for larger.	O
Um print.	O
Projects like billboards posters, ETC or printed shirts and sweaters like I wear a lot of the year that I design.	O
That has art that I designed.	CHITCHAT
And so, so you need sharp clean brushes sharp clean vectors.	O
And so.	CHITCHAT
My process involves a lot of sketching and drawing and as you can see.	O
I've sketched out the concept as I guess that's what I like.	O
That's what kind of what I'm going for.	CHITCHAT
Then I drew out all the letters and you'll see this process and earlier videos.	CHITCHAT
In the This process is just shape shape shape get the shapes out and get the letters out don't worry about the composition just yet.	O
And now I'm in the process of drawing out.	O
The pencils and markers, etc and having a composition in mine as I'm drawing it an but I'm not really stuck in that composition like?	O
If when I get to the letter MFI feels too, cluttered and those look a little clarity.	O
I'm going to clean it up, I'm going to readjust.	O
And let the our talk to me.	CHITCHAT
That's the step that I'm in right now an I'm on the letter.	O
H.	O
At the end of our last night video I finished the liturgy an by the time I was offline.	CHITCHAT
I was doing some testing an so I've worked on the letter H for a little bit so there.	CHITCHAT
It is COO COO COO.	CHITCHAT
I am DTM like I said earlier.	CHITCHAT
Find me on Behance dot creative genius.	CHITCHAT
But basically I'm everywhere on the Internet under DTM so let's go ahead and find that brush I mean that.	O
Layer so there's the gene there's the GI turned off, let's turn that back on so you can see it.	O
There it goes.	O
And let me tell you I worked on all this on the iPad pro.	O
They all these layers and work so far was done in the iPad pro.	O
I have imported that file into the Surface Pro and now that's where I'm going to work on it.	O
In all the settings and things that are left behind is still the same way.	O
The pencil brush size over here on the left hand side is still the same size.	O
The color and then the brush that I was using?	O
Alright cool cool cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's get to it.	CHITCHAT
I do like to close my layers off the screen, so that I don't.	O
Accidentally bump it, I close also the UI get rid of everything so that I can kind of see the.	O
The canvas real clean like and do the work that I want to do.	O
So last night, I started this looks like an old deodorant, but let's pretend it's a marker so I started with the letter H?	O
And let me just suggest that right So what happens when I want to erase well because I'm using the Surface Pro.	O
Look at that I just turned a surface.	O
Pan around and I use the eraser.	O

So I got.	O
Their flat.	O
Kind of squarish.	O
And flat I like that right so then all they got very cool.	O
Looking design right here and what's funny about these like it's got their fatness?	O
Of course, get the skin in this right there, too, but then the fan is goes into a thin.	O
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Tip area and then the tip in I do like the chisel tip on always.	O
Can never understand why this chisel tip and but when you start using markers on paper and other things?	O
You listen turn to get the thick part the fat part, then part shading and so on so.	O
So yeah, so I like these markets.	CHITCHAT
These are cool and they have a cool body so.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna draw that here.	O
Schooling there.	O
It's OK to have references always have references for your work.	O
There we go boom.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Statler.	O
I guess that's how you say that so that's cool one set of markers down.	O
These are whole some my favorite I get him I put him in my little.	CHITCHAT
Sandwich bags, so I can keep track as I got a pile.	CHITCHAT
You know, I do have other.	CHITCHAT
Drawers full of markers regarding your hand in but some of these are keep him.	CHITCHAT
In a bag so I have these cranks on this one is going to kind of busted I don't know why.	CHITCHAT
There's the create marker.	O
Hasn't been used, if you see some of the ink those tiny?	CHITCHAT
Kind of use them.	CHITCHAT
For shake it hard enough, I'll get the paint loose.	CHITCHAT
Or maybe this one dried up.	CHITCHAT
This one, I can hear it.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Any case, they got a cool tip.	O
It's got a cool little body Indiana.	O
And under the cap area, so I like that how it comes in out and has a little part so this is still flat.	O
But you know what?	CHITCHAT
What if we drew one like this, a draw marker like that right this.	CHITCHAT
Let's see which way is Seville.	O
Yes, like this.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's try that one.	O
And that could draw that one right here.	O
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you can't see the rest of it 'cause it goes down there.	O
Let's go here.	O
Grab this go there, there, so all shapes.	O
It is true that own shape.	O
Another shape and then boom.	O
Chisel tip.	O
And this one is actually kind of a shizzle tip, but it has around part.	O
So any case.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Be hands, we need a traditional challenge so I can break out my markers.	CHITCHAT
And draw with them, so now that I did that one then I'm going to go ahead and make that.	O
Corner.	O
And then go like that so.	O
What I really want to do is?	CHITCHAT
Have one marker coming out right here.	O
Then I have another marker coming out right there.	O
And then one just kind of.	O
Back here so let's make that a pencil.	O
There it is you see boom pencil.	O
Marker alright so now we got the fabric Castell has cool markers.	O
And so they got the brush tip very cool.	O
Let's see can we Show it, yes, yes yes.	CHITCHAT
Um broke the cap on that one, it's gotta cool bodies got the grooves.	CHITCHAT
On the back, I guess you can refill them or something it's got the cool inside the cap turns twists and turns.	CHITCHAT
And it's going to be hard to say that these are all different because they're going to be kind of similar.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
But I'll know they're different.	O
Let's just do that.	O
That's it and then do the other one like that.	O
Fabric Castel.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Who cuckoo?	CHITCHAT
And now I close that up and see so by looking at this letter.	O
H.	O
I'm making changes, and adjustments to the way these markers and pencils.	O
Are working with each other?	O
Because when I first drew the shapes.	O
I just need to get the shapes out.	O
You don't want to get stuck in all the details just yet.	O
All right, so here we have the last part of the Age.	O
Let's put these markers back in their bag everything has to go or belongs otherwise it's chaos.	O

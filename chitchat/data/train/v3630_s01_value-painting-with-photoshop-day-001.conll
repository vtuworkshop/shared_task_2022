Hello.	CHITCHAT
How are you guys doing?	CHITCHAT
Let me take a look over here, real quick.	CHITCHAT
Today we're going to be doing some value grading.	O
In photo shop today.	O
This is going to be my first be hand stream.	CHITCHAT
I've been streaming on Twitch for awhile now doing art.	CHITCHAT
But moving from platform to platform is.	CHITCHAT
Not always the smoothest generations.	CHITCHAT
We're going to see today just how well it goes for me.	CHITCHAT
On Twitch I typically make.	CHITCHAT
Kinda dumb illustrations lots of.	CHITCHAT
Kind of over the Top stuff I'm not going to share any of that with you guys here today.	CHITCHAT
But I am going to be doing some value paintings more serious stuff because I feel like I don't really get a lot of opportunities to do things that are a little bit more.	O
Serious working on refining my skills that's typically stuff that I do off stream.	O
So I thought it might be fun to do some actual thoughtful practice.	O
Live on on be hand today so.	CHITCHAT
We're going to start it out.	O
With some ideas and some simple stuff well.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Give me just one second.	CHITCHAT
Give me one second.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
You can find.	CHITCHAT
OK, I thought it might be a good idea to do some basic shapes.	O
You know it's not often that you go back to doing.	O
Foundational work.	O
So I think that's going to be pretty important, and typically well.	O
I'm not an amateur so I'm going to be.	CHITCHAT
Doing somewhat.	CHITCHAT
Kind of advanced practice.	CHITCHAT
Is there a popup chat option?	CHITCHAT
So it's just going to be.	CHITCHAT
And stuff.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
To start with?	O
Pyramids are pretty easy want to start out with.	O
Did you have a fair bit there?	CHITCHAT
I've got the tendency to approach this like a tutorial but.	CHITCHAT
It's really not so maybe I won't maybe I won't go in that direction.	CHITCHAT
Somewhere in here is a nice watercolor brush.	O
This one's trailer.	O
Search is to quick adjustment.	O
I'd like to bring up some reference in here.	O
I've got some photos of my own I like use actually.	O
There might be some good ones in here.	O

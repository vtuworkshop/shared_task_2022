Will try this one.	O
These are raw photographs, so they shouldn't be.	O
Q Biased One way or the other as far as values go in colors like that.	O
So what I'd like to do is make a concrete.	O
Pyramid here.	O
And what we can do.	CHITCHAT
Is?	CHITCHAT
Completely get rid of all the color in here by converting this to black and white.	O
And this does some interesting things that honestly like this is probably the biggest factor of my interest in doing value painting.	O
Is uh?	CHITCHAT
Just how the colors work now.	CHITCHAT
You look at the blue and you'll think that's a lot brighter, you know.	O
Then everything else in the photos like the blue looks very.	O
Vivid and bright.	O
But it's actually darker in value.	O
Then the conquered which appears to be a lot darker in my eyes.	O
It's just interesting how.	CHITCHAT
How my perceptions?	CHITCHAT
I have sort of suggested to me that the Sky is lighter than a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Rocks and things like that, but it's really not.	CHITCHAT
I think that's really fascinating and.	CHITCHAT
That's the big motivation for doing value painting for Maine.	CHITCHAT
But see like I think this shadow here.	O
Now there's a pretty considerable difference, there still.	O
Are there any values?	CHITCHAT
Already on this.	CHITCHAT
So it's not a lot of variation in general.	O
All these things like it's either concrete that's dark concrete.	O
This light or Sky.	O
You know that's all there really is here.	O
And I guess the metal as well, which is interesting how it.	O
Like that.	CHITCHAT
I think it's an interesting thing to keep in mind.	CHITCHAT
But That being said, We're going to make it nice.	O
Pyramid of concrete so I want to use these values as much as I can.	O
I'm going to study the texture because the texture of material those are really important things.	O
When you want to make a material look like something or other.	O
You want to make sure you match its properties in appearance right so there's a lot of.	O
Little micro features in here little variations of the texture, the way that it reacts to the light, it's defusal.	O
And not very specular, unlike the railing here?	O
Which.	O
Has very few details and when it interacts with the direct source of Light, the reflection itself.	O
This is where the This is where the light would come down and then hit and then reflect off into the lens.	O
That very quickly overexposes, but other than that there's basically no.	O
Conspicuous details or texture in the middle from this distance, obviously closer up you'll see more.	O
More variations like over here for example.	O
Part of that's the limitations of the Camera itself.	O
But the other part of that is.	O
The actual sub surface details well, I guess not really subsurface.	O
I feel like I should probably.	O
Shrink it down or more convenient reference use.	O
That right there.	O
Will have this be deciding Indiana highlights and make this the website.	O
Are darker side?	O

I think this is a good example here so.	CHITCHAT
In this particular instance the light is directly hitting this space here.	O
But even though this is only well judging by the light hitting.	O
From back here somewhere.	O
Pointing out that direction possibly.	O
More off screen that you can't see.	O
I would say probably even uh.	O
If this work to be part of the image is well back in 3 space to someone probably be closer to here.	O
Maybe closer here.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Not quite perpendicular to this plane.	O
But even still it should think for a lot of objects that would be maybe a little bit more.	O
Rounded on the edges or these these concrete pillars do tend to be.	O
Babble dot pH.	O
Like this, where it's more of a shape that bends around like that.	O
Those kinds of colors and you can see a little bit of that right here.	O
So we'll add a little bit of a bevel or so I'm not sure which it would be in this case.	O
And I think, to do that, what I'd like to do.	O
Is take an average blur of these 2 samples of color?	O
That way I can get a?	O
Pretty fair mid tone.	O
Not to worry about.	CHITCHAT
Details of the shape being terribly specific.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty common to get uneven.	O
Rush shapes with culinary more anyways, so if anything my irregularities will.	O
Only add to the effect.	O
We can approach this.	O
I think I'd like to add a few.	O
To match the pyramid theme a few like tiles.	O
Where the rapes they can pull this might stack?	CHITCHAT
Blocks.	CHITCHAT
Nixon details like that.	CHITCHAT
Of course we will.	O
Connect this corner this corner kind of similar perspective, so I want to make sure to match those such as I can.	O
I would use this trip.	CHITCHAT
Play nice.	CHITCHAT
This man.	CHITCHAT
I'm not considering too much.	CHITCHAT
These lines would converge slowly overtime.	O
0.	O
Number down the pyramid.	O
It is something I would normally.	CHITCHAT
Pretty nice and clear.	CHITCHAT
I will.	CHITCHAT
Shadows of decreases here this is getting a little bit, too much in the details, which isn't what I really want to do here.	O
It's more important to make.	O

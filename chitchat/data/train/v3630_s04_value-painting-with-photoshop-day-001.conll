That's what I meant for texturing materials.	O
Lighting.	O
All these things better.	O
Combined.	O
So here we have a?	CHITCHAT
It looks like a period so far, but I think it looks terribly great, so we're going to add A.	O
Layer on Top of this.	O
Points had a somewhat.	O
Darker colored lipstick.	O
Not as dark as the mid tone.	O
But a little bit better than that.	O
And I would like to add some irregularities.	O
Darker bits to make it have a little bit more for it to it.	O
As a reference image has.	O
Lots of you can see where water has.	O
Landed in warm.	O
Surface.	O
He's worked with values here.	O
Compared.	O
This color selection.	O
Right.	O
A chance.	O
Let's compare.	O
Just got this fairly bright colored here.	O
This is fairly darker color here.	O
And this one falls right apps my.	O
Current.	O
Selected.	O
Saturation values.	O
That's right.	O
Just make it less sharp.	O
I'm not worried, so much about keeping track of my layers at the moment but I'm going to buy.	O
If necessary.	O
Biggest point.	O
We might get the.	CHITCHAT
I've been using the same water cover abortions.	O
It's an interesting thing to note here about.	O
How shadows can imply?	O
Both texture.	O
And space so it's pretty obvious.	O
Looking at this photo that.	CHITCHAT
Uh this is a?	CHITCHAT
Very clearly it's an edge is very nearly stepped in perspective to this image.	O
We don't look at this as being.	O
A flat plane with variations of texture right.	O
You don't see that this dark area.	O
It's not like a sticker or painting it.	O
Actual volumes, so space is being occupied.	O
But when you look at for example, this imperfection, you don't see that as being.	O
Spades are deaf and you see that it's being.	O
A change in service right so it's going to be interesting too.	O
Make this Gray.	O
Not look like.	O
Texture and bumps, but rather.	O
Cereal.	O
Not thought you would rather next year.	CHITCHAT
So that means I will not be putting.	O
Rounding out edges like this implies that a lot of the time for a material like this.	O
Or, a darker edge would imply depth as well.	O
So I want to make sure to get this in just the right spots that makes it look like it's.	O

More of a drip texture than anything.	O
That wasn't really something I considered before so it's interesting to think about now.	CHITCHAT
I'm not too sure what I can do with the darker edge.	O
That I think.	CHITCHAT
Let's change brushes, I've got a good selection here.	O
I think I'd like to try this dry texture brush will see how this works out.	O
That's a bit extreme right now, but if I press a little lighter, it's not so bad.	O
This is a good brush for implying more of a texture and texture really is just a variation an.	O
And bumps.	O
That's really what texture is.	O
For the most part I suppose.	O
Obviously things like slimy.	O
Is a texture that doesn't really relate to?	O
The pumps for rather more like friction right.	O
So I guess friction bumps tend to.	O
Fall under that texture category.	O
And concrete is pretty bumpy so it's good to have.	O
I don't want to over use this brush, too much.	O
This is actually really nice one of the biggest features that.	O
Had trouble.	O
Capturing.	O
Or, a value paintings.	O
His brushes reading a lot of skills, which will really talk about alarm for something like this.	CHITCHAT
But of course, it's gotta be done.	CHITCHAT
This is an interesting balancing act of love.	CHITCHAT
Textures.	O
I think it might be a good idea to.	CHITCHAT
I'm not entirely sure if you'd find this in reality.	O
Sort of.	O
But I guess the idea there is that there's	O
Texture on the opposite side, as well right and that's catching some of the light.	O
That might be taken over the edge here.	O
A little bit of texture here as well for the same effect.	O
But this is going to be using uh.	CHITCHAT
I've put the texture on a separate layer so when I turn this on and off.	O
You'll be able to see the improvement that it makes.	O
It's simple.	O
But I think it's pretty.	CHITCHAT
I think it's too early to do this in general, but I'd like to make color layer on Top of my.	O
As well.	O
You can see the.	O

I should look around to see if I have any like?	O
That are the same but different colors.	O
Oh, I guess paint does that doesn't have any paint.	O
I think that I do.	CHITCHAT
Well, one thing I like to do that I think is interesting.	CHITCHAT
Let's see if this file.	CHITCHAT
Give me one second.	CHITCHAT
My shift key is really loud.	CHITCHAT
Let me get this screen and.	CHITCHAT
Light industry.	CHITCHAT
And then we're going to do the same thing with some.	O
And the same thing with some Reds.	O
Now all I did was change.	O
He will those colors, I haven't changed anything else about it.	O
Although I guess you might argue that my actual gradient is making are quite the same.	O
For the most part we've got 3 strips of radiated Reds Blues and greens right.	O
And here we will put on any other black and white.	O
And here we can see.	O
Not very vividly the bands of those colors so.	O
The red that looks like it has a much less.	O
Gradual transition it starts very dark.	O
Quickly.	O
Makes its way into a?	O
Wider territory.	O
There's only this band of Grey's that's that's really available.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Or are blue.	O
There's a lot of darker colors.	O
And a lot more gradual grades all through this area.	O
You get lots of well, what appears to be mostly the same.	O
Value there at the beginning.	O
It works its way up a lot more gradual.	O
Although the lighter values seemed to maybe accelerated a little bit more.	O
And then work topping out right around here.	O
A little bit.	O
But not quite as dark.	O
What's interesting is at a glance and really no matter?	CHITCHAT
How long you look at this, I would bet you would never guess what the original colors were.	CHITCHAT
Well, you might be able to guess that blue has a bit more of a wider spectrum of values.	O
Green is a little bit.	O
Lower than blue I suppose we'd it looked like we decided that Green had a much wider spectrum.	O
On this image here, but this is kind of giving me a bit of a different story.	O
And part of the issue is that I started with the colour and went to not color so that's a little bit better.	O
Another thing to do is.	O
We can.	O
Make a series of.	O
3 skills.	O
This one is definitely going to be the same.	O
The same amount of value across the board, unlike the other one and then we will add.	O
Yep.	CHITCHAT
Our red.	O

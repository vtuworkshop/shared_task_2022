Quick green.	O
Front end.	O
Surprise to clipping and then color no we want to do.	O
Oh yeah colors are upset.	O
I look at this, this is pretty dramatic.	O
You can see the.	CHITCHAT
Fans here.	CHITCHAT
Or, a lot more conspicuously broken up.	CHITCHAT
He's got a pretty obvious, but this might actually be part of my monitor calibration in fairness, but to me, it looks like.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty dramatic transition here.	O
Anyone there as well.	CHITCHAT
That should probably be true, nonetheless, but I think that my monitor might exaggerate that affect a little bit.	CHITCHAT
But that shows me that we have a pretty large band.	O
Grab one of my.	O
New favorite brushes.	O
Where is that?	CHITCHAT
I think it might have been.	CHITCHAT
I think I might have to add it again.	O
They all look the same.	O
I like this one quite a bit.	O
Looks to me like.	CHITCHAT
That's a pretty.	CHITCHAT
Similar color here all throughout the most part, obviously there are some variations, but it's pretty much that's all we get for that.	O
And then I would say up to about here is about the same as well.	O
All of this tends to be roughly the same value.	O
The green has a much more narrow band right around here.	O
And the red is maybe about in the midway point between those.	O
Reds.	O
I'm trying my best to clean.	O
What?	CHITCHAT
This information can tell me how to use this in the future.	CHITCHAT
But basically the Long story short.	CHITCHAT
Is that?	CHITCHAT
Blues tend to have a lot more.	O
Variety of midtones it seems like.	O
The greens have a lot less variety.	O
In the mid tones and the red might actually have.	O
Perhaps the greens have a lot more variety in the highlights.	O
And the Reds.	O
The rights of a very short value span.	O
In any case.	O
At a very narrow.	O
Range of really valuable.	O
Colors in there.	O
Otherwise, completely consistent resale values.	O
Put that This becomes a very important.	O
Aspect of value painting, which we don't get to very shortly.	O
I'm going to take a break for about 5 or 6 minutes.	CHITCHAT
We've been nearly at the hour mark.	CHITCHAT
So I will take a little intermission, but before that, I will jump ahead, a little bit to A.	O
Another value painting, I think I actually have this file still.	O
This was something I did a little bit more fun.	CHITCHAT
But I think it.	CHITCHAT
Is pretty important Oh?	CHITCHAT
I'll grab this Obi Wan kenobi as well?	O
It's kind of relevant in some ways.	O
I need to find some.	O
This Yoda illustration.	O
Where did he go?	CHITCHAT
Here it is.	CHITCHAT
OK, with this, I will leave you for just a moment left me.	CHITCHAT

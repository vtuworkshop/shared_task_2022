I can do that without worrying about destroying the boots.	CHITCHAT
That was something I had wanted to do for a while, but it just takes a little bit more effort that I was willing to give it at the time.	CHITCHAT
But for this one, I thought it was worth it.	CHITCHAT
Next up, I made a series of layers above this to give it some more depth.	O
I will start from.	O
Top to bottom well, I guess the light Saber itself isn't too big of a factor.	O
But I started out with a pretty simple.	O
Layer on Top here, these are just all the covers.	O
There's no.	O
Shadows are values, the only time that we get something like this is when I have this set color mode.	O
And my aim is to color pick certain areas now, what's interesting is if I get this dark value here.	O
It makes.	O
Basically, the difference.	O
As opposed to like the lighter 1 sample.	O
It's making no difference here, sending this normally you can see that.	O
Doesn't need?	CHITCHAT
But as far as the values for let it be changed.	O
So it's able to effectively that's what happens.	O
We get a situation where the color.	O
Picker troublespots variation like that, but otherwise totally flat color and it's getting all of its value information.	O
From the skill players below.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
This was a real testament to see if I could manage to match.	O
The reference colors and the reference values.	O
The values are the most important part really.	O
That's that's kind of the whole point here, I think I have a?	O
Somewhere around here, let me just doing take this.	CHITCHAT
OK, so this is going to be a flat Gray scale here.	O
And I can affect.	O
This layer above.	O
By selecting a Fresh produce.	O
The colors will be more affected by.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Of course, saturation is a big part of that as well.	O
So if I were to add a very high contrast point.	O
Depending on the actual color being used it would react to a little bit different.	O
So this is a fairly dark color with Totaly Black Color Loli built himself narrow this range is here.	O
It's pretty dramatic.	O
Change as it goes along.	O
But save this for red.	O
It would be a little bit different you see how much more.	O
Pronounce the red looks.	O
It's roughly the same.	O
Level of green.	O
As far as well, I guess.	O
Maybe not let's make it a bit more balanced and make it look like that.	O
That looks way more muted doesn't.	O
If we were to get a much richer green like this.	O
It would be a bit dramatic with them.	O
But you can get.	O
Large variety of colors out of this.	O
The Blue looks a lot lower than the green doesn't mind.	O
That makes sense.	O
So that is the.	O
One of the earlier ones.	O

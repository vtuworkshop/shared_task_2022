There's actually a Pok√©mon design that I've done as well.	O
Oh, the reason I bring will be born into this.	O
Because I thought it might be a good idea to practice taking still shots of a video or movie.	O
And then turning it into a black and white image and then trying to replicate those values.	O
Without color picking ideally between instead just.	O
I don't think about the colour values and how those all work together and interesting Lee is skin.	O
I think is skin will be a good?	O
A good reference point here?	O
Can I get my zoom tool please.	O
I will color pick this just for example, so the highest brightest point of his face.	O
He's about as bright as the mid tones on his jacket here his robe and his robe to me appears to be.	O
Pretty great.	CHITCHAT
And there are similar colors to learn the similar Hue saturation range.	O
But they look very different.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be an important task to learn how to?	CHITCHAT
For example, the shirt look different than his belt spell.	O
Obviously looks like weather and that's part of the specular's on the belt and how it highlights.	O
A lot more variety in there.	O
It's got much.	CHITCHAT
There's no spectres here.	O
Those are right now, very shiny, leather doesn't look like steel, but it does look like a metal or.	O
It does look like weather.	O
I don't know why it wouldn't speak so spectre like that's what makes that.	O
So specular Polish up that right.	O
But.	O
Could just be the look of it right and you probably know that could be steel right but?	O
Our assumption is to think that it's leather based on like the contact.	O
Uniform I suppose.	O
So that might just be a big factor of.	CHITCHAT
Yep.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
But some I have used values just see how good I am at maybe it would be a good idea to.	O
Not use a black and white but instead just sort of gauging guessing what those values might be on appearance.	O
So let's start with.	CHITCHAT
For this rose.	O
I mean, I was already color picking it and thinking about it so.	CHITCHAT
It's a bit unfair, but if I were to just come over here.	O
And forget.	CHITCHAT
So let's think about the darkest point, so the darkest point is here and if we compare that to.	O
I guess this.	CHITCHAT
This what is that like a gasket?	CHITCHAT
That gasket is the darkest point.	O
The darkest point in his robe is maybe a year and that difference is pretty dramatic say that.	O
The gasket represents the bottom is probably closer to here and that isn't probably not quite white.	O
Pretty close, though, so we have a dynamic range of about about this much dynamic range, which is a lot.	O
It's a lot of great there.	O
But the next practice things like this fire in the background, not even this light well.	O
They're pretty close, but I guess the flight is the next brightest thing and that's The Dark Stone, comparing it.	O
So I'd say that are workable dynamic dynamic range is right about in here.	O
So that gives me some information to work with.	O
So that in that case, his robe being one of the brighter objects in the scene.	O
I'd probably put that.	O
Around here.	O
Will just take this in?	CHITCHAT
Just really want to sleep.	CHITCHAT
That's roughly my guess of what Obi Wan's rules like very scale.	CHITCHAT
And then of course, there's got little variations in there, a little bit of.	O
The highlight.	O
Comparing the highlighted that the Top of his robe to this light back here.	O

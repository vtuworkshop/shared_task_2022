It's uh.	CHITCHAT
It looks to be a good deal.	CHITCHAT
Darker so I'll put that around there.	O
Keep it brighter than that even.	O
So those are are.	O
Working color ranges looks like Oh and also the shadows 2.	O
So we've got one big shadow coming out of this crisis here.	O
I don't know if it's quite that dark, but that's what's going to work with for now.	O
I can't wait until I can actually understand this and discuss it without.	CHITCHAT
Without feeling like I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
So we don't get a whole lot of.	CHITCHAT
3D and variation.	CHITCHAT
There's a pretty quick transition from from this lighter color to the darker color.	O
There's not a lot of in between's.	O
So with that, said put this right about there.	O
And that some of the.	CHITCHAT
In the creases enfolds.	O
My goal here isn't too.	O
Accurately recreate the rope, though, I just want to get like a general.	O
Layout of where those colors and values would lie.	O
So we have a much.	O
Brighter color brighter value along the Top edge here.	O
And that does transition slowly into a darker value.	O
It doesn't ever go.	O
Fully to the darkest value until we get to near the bottom.	O
Or that.	O
Smoking reefer.	O
And you don't want to see it.	CHITCHAT
So that his can't help it's like a shirt or like a scarf almost but that's pretty dark.	O
Probably it's dark.	O
As the darkest part of his robe.	O
And it's got pretty sharp highlights actually.	O
I wonder if I could end up making this into a reasonable painting, I spent enough time on it.	CHITCHAT
Just by going.	CHITCHAT
From value to value blocking him out.	CHITCHAT
One of my favorite things and honestly, most aggravating things is.	CHITCHAT
How light plays on cloth that has always plot the general has always been a really difficult thing for me?	CHITCHAT
Maybe one day I'll do a series of cloth studies.	CHITCHAT
Think about it yet.	CHITCHAT
Just have a hard time I hope.	CHITCHAT
This doesn't to me sound like royalty, free music.	CHITCHAT
This is supposed to be a relatively free playlist on Spotify, but it doesn't.	CHITCHAT
Like I'm pretty sure that this is well let it play.	CHITCHAT
I don't think your job is considered to Grill tonight.	CHITCHAT
Hard to fight my bias of wanting to as I'm painting this not even look at the reference but.	CHITCHAT

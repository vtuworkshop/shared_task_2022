I've got lots of photographs that I've taken over time.	CHITCHAT
What we got here?	CHITCHAT
This might be a good piece to practice with.	O
Um do I have any jpegs of this.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
9535.	O
This is got a good amount of.	O
Variation range, the Sky completely white, the Blacks fairly dark fairly dark Blacks here.	O
And lots of dynamic range aside from the Sky.	O
I did get the raw deal as it were all that.	O
The lens flare stands at a lot more when it's in.	O
Where is my histogram let's bring that over?	O
So yeah, it looks like we've got a pretty high range was this.	O
We've got clipping values there.	O
I'm going to see that very well.	O
I'm not skill this histogram up at all right here, we go luminosity.	O
I don't often use histograms so this is a little bit weird.	O
Will this update in?	O
In real time.	O
Depending on You know similar.	CHITCHAT
It does.	O
Interesting I think the idea typically is that you want to.	O
Have a fairly even histogram right is that the idea.	O
I wonder why it's called a histogram.	CHITCHAT
But that does give us an idea of what are our dynamic range is right, I think that's the idea.	O
OK, this is my plan.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to duplicate this an flatten it with the grayscale so now it is a?	O
Applied as a grayscale image and I'm going to do filter and then blur and then Gaussian blur doesn't really matter, which blur I use.	O
My goal here is going to be to reconstruct this blurry image using what I've learned so that's going to include.	O
Texture trying to bring back some of those sharper edges and bring back some of those details, which is my biggest weakness is getting the details.	O
That don't look too overdone right laying around the lens flare is going to be tough as well so I might.	O
Not worry about that, too much.	CHITCHAT
And our little friend here is going to have a?	CHITCHAT
Especially because not only is there not a lot of variation there's a lot of noise in this image, but.	O
I think that's wonderful but you can't really see the details at all.	O
There's nothing there to be seen it just dark.	O
Every so often.	CHITCHAT
I won't take into account the cometic aberration, though.	O
Let's just sort of a thing that happens.	O
Or if I can fix that.	O
He said, like a?	CHITCHAT
Is there a lens correction?	CHITCHAT
I think that's mostly for?	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is have a chromatic aberration option in here.	O
How do I enable that?	CHITCHAT
Custom.	O
It was most noticeable down here by the rocks.	O
So let's see.	O
Red Sky in French.	CHITCHAT
Blue yellow.	O
A little bit.	O

Typically, Oh is it?	CHITCHAT
Wow, look at that that's done a lot of work.	O
Where is it most noticeable?	O
This is with the trivia on.	O
The bridge is pretty empty.	O
For that.	O
And those are cleared up, there's still a little bit of.	O
Magenta.	O
Digital.	O
Exaggerated.	O
A little bit.	O
Previous turned off.	O
I can actually apply for matic aberration in this.	O
At least I imagine you could.	O
Maybe it just needs to have those values before then, actually actually but I know that.	O
Some subgenres like the news chromatic aberration purpose.	O
Interesting up ships entirely.	O
It's kind of funny now are.	CHITCHAT
Are black-and-white doesn't match up anymore?	O
Combine those There we go.	O
And we'll just play this again.	O
OK so now we have the task of trying to Basically do a reconstruction a restoration of this image here.	O
I'm going to grab my new favorite.	O
Value painting brush the airbrush here and see what I can get out of here.	O
Really quickly, I can make a bit of match against the Sky here too.	O
Bring back our sharper edge.	O

I'm not allowed so why not make the image look a bit nicer.	CHITCHAT
I see.	CHITCHAT
And this will sort of push a bit more into.	O
The stages of.	O

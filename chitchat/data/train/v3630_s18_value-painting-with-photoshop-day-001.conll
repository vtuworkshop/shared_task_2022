The shape.	O
Just to get some more.	O
Natural.	O
Shape and direction of these edges.	O
Values here.	O
That's the main goal.	O
I'm not expecting to just make a couple of clicks.	CHITCHAT
Of my stylus here and get.	CHITCHAT
Instant read you know that's not really why.	CHITCHAT
Had in mind.	CHITCHAT
But plants are probably one of the most frustrating things for me.	O
Due to the fact that they have so many layers.	O
Between the Camera.	O
And the background.	O
Go hit stacks of as you can see like.	O
Here, there are.	O
Foreground.	O
Names but also background leaves.	O
And they overlap and come back and forth quite a bit.	O
And it makes a pretty complex complex pattern.	O
I should have made a duplicate I probably can still.	O
2.	CHITCHAT
Work as a before and after.	O
There we go.	O
Alright I'm going to now grab.	O
Airbrush yet again.	O
Try to push this energy.	CHITCHAT
Smaller I make this the part of the brush tip boots.	O
Why I think I like it so much?	CHITCHAT
Make it a bit bigger.	O
I think it's off general shapes.	O
And also make it a bit smaller, too.	O
It's kind of weird, my eyes are making a bit of a Halo effect where it looks to me.	CHITCHAT
As if this inner side here like just just right here.	O
It looks like it's really bright.	O
And brighter than this, but these are actually the exact same.	O
But it makes the darker value look brighter to me somehow.	O
Not much just be like a limitation of human eyes because that kind of hurts actually.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it looks like there's a little Halo.	CHITCHAT
Making it difficult to tell.	CHITCHAT
Or the edges actually are.	CHITCHAT
I might just be a side effect of looking at a screen for too long and too hard, though.	CHITCHAT
I find that the most from working with color really.	CHITCHAT
That's why I like winter more I think.	CHITCHAT
It's more simple doesn't hurt your eyes, so much.	CHITCHAT
What's really weird for me is that I tend to find?	CHITCHAT
That.	CHITCHAT
While I'm working on something that colors.	CHITCHAT
I see aren't exactly what they are.	CHITCHAT
In reality.	CHITCHAT
And I have to get away and let my eyes.	CHITCHAT
We adjust the lighting around me, I guess to see that covers leaders they are.	CHITCHAT
But like I would swear though I guess there is a bit of a variation there, but I would swear that this is brighter than this, but it's not.	CHITCHAT
Not really sure why I felt the need as well.	CHITCHAT
I liked this image here.	CHITCHAT
I guess that was more for me to separate right.	CHITCHAT
But really there's not a whole lot of depth to this.	O
I know.	CHITCHAT
Based on my knowledge of bridges and foundations that there is in fact, a lip.	O
Around the outside and you can tell that by the shape here as well.	O
It's it's not just a shape that.	O
Goes down and flares out, it's a 3 dimensional object that.	O
Goes down and out to make this lip around the whole thing.	O
And I think that the biggest factor for that, really is just uh you know if there's a separation of texture like this is a pretty consistent texture all the way down.	O

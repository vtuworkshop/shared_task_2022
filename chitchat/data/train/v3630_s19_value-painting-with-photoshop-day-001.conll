There's not any hard cuts.	O
Really aside from like maybe like?	O
Around that rim here.	O
But it's really just the shape and there's not a lot of like play going on here with the gradient.	O
It's all like a pretty uniform.	O
It's pretty uniform out of light along this whole side here and most part on this as well like a lot of this has very uniform lighting.	O
I have a tendency to be a bit exaggerative.	O
When I'm when I do grayscale values so I'll typically make a ball.	O
If I were to make a ball, which I often make the ball and then give it a nice.	O
Highlight and then give it a nice shadow as well.	O
But like it's not often the case it's usually pretty.	O
Flat flat shape typically not a lot of like.	O
I've just found that in real life, the unless there's a very sharp distinct light.	O
There tends to not really be a whole lot of.	O
Variation down here, I can't really use this as a good reference because I have 2 pretty sharp like non diffused lights.	O
So they do, make a lot of shadows and highlights on me.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Typically let's see do I have any around objects that there's a backpack here that may be a good one?	O
Take a look at this price.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, like this is generally like there's not a lot of roundness to it, even though that there is.	O
To expand on that, even further if you were to have like a cylinder?	O
I would typically make this face a little bit more gradually shadowed right now would start on the highlights.	O
I'd pretty bright.	O
And then get like darker overtime, but this is sort of illustrating that it's not really it's more that.	O
It's it's midtones mostly.	O
Well, I say Midtones, mostly I don't really know like these to me, I would almost call highlight sections.	O
But yeah, like the light hits.	O
Or it doesn't, it and you get either.	O
He exposed areas or you don't.	O
But this lighting condition is pretty unique in them so I think I think that.	O
A large part of the lighting.	O
This is why I have to do more studies.	CHITCHAT
You kind of get an idea of what you think is going on.	CHITCHAT
And that might not always be the case.	CHITCHAT
Example actually look at this series schedule.	CHITCHAT
We highlight we have roughly mid tone.	O
And that does have a bit of a a round shape to it, so that might be a good example actually.	O
Being around object.	O
Almost looking straight on.	O
How does this model?	O
Reflect what we're seeing here off obviously it's a bit darker on the other side.	O
More like that.	O
I'm not sure what this is up at the Top, though the way that that has that darker edge by the seam.	O
Is that?	CHITCHAT
Is that just a variation in the color of the hat?	O
I wonder?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have to study some other artists.	CHITCHAT

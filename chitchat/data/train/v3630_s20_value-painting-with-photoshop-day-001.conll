I've been looking for people on like YouTube at the moment.	CHITCHAT
And a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
We had live as well to see other people doing stuff like this and how they approach because I think it's really fascinating.	CHITCHAT
Typically, it's a bit of a weird.	CHITCHAT
A weird toss up some people don't like to do value.	CHITCHAT
Some people just jump right into it, which I typically do as well.	CHITCHAT
And that's what I do for the most part is I'll start with.	CHITCHAT
I've got a pretty simple non formula painting.	CHITCHAT
Up.	CHITCHAT
Lol.	CHITCHAT
Typically have My flats.	CHITCHAT
And then I will make a new layer on Top of that set the multiply and choose my lighting source.	O
Add a shadow.	O
On that.	O
And then sometimes I'll make an overlay layer.	O
With a bit of a brighter light to match with that was.	O
I like there I tend to get some pretty rich colors out of that and I'm a big fan of that, but my.	O
Dynamic range is typically pretty narrow because of that.	O
Which.	CHITCHAT
Is it might be like if we were to pop this into a black and white as well.	O
You can see there's not a lot of variation.	O
You know you don't you don't get a lot of a lot of depth.	O
And I guess to remedy that I would just change like how I go about at night at their core values.	O
What's nice is this sort of takes our current colour and then just like steps it.	O
You know it adds a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
What I would normally do actually that's what I would do is I would also?	CHITCHAT
I would take my desired color.	O
I would step it down a little bit.	O
And then just change.	O
The value up and down is there value left and right as or saturation just drop the value a little bit.	O
And then desaturate it just a little bit.	O
Add in my value there.	O
And that's the kind of the same a similar result.	O
I don't do it as dramatically.	O
I guess but think about the issues which is even more dramatic, but we get roughly the same.	O
Area.	O
For the most part.	O
And then for highlights up typically do the opposite of what I just did so I would step up a little bit.	O
And then go a little diagonally to an ad in my highlight that way.	O
And that's also kind of what we did.	O
Here, as well.	O
So that's interesting how those 2 methods overlap, but the cool thing about doing a multiply layer.	O
Because they don't really have to do that.	O
For every step.	O
If you've got you know 600 colors in your painting, which you.	O
Probably really shouldn't you should only have probably no more than like 32 different types of color.	O
But it would be a bit of a pain to have to do that for each and every color so.	O
Pretty effective.	O
For doing a more gradual coloring, obviously for paintings like cell shading that's a different story.	O
But even then I guess it's really not because if you have associated character just a flat line art.	O
Character.	O
Grab my new favorite brushes.	O
On his head.	O
And then maybe like a cool mask.	O
It looks a bit like a?	O
A minor.	O
He's got a mask, he's got like I don't know a jacket onto.	O
So we want to give him like a metal helmet right and so will give him a metal helmet.	O
And I will color it.	O
And they will give him like let's give him green skin.	O
Play FNG keys are really close together, so I tend to press.	O
Full screen what I mean to press Phil.	O
Get my red bandana today?	CHITCHAT

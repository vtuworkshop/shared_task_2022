About a blue one.	O
And then we'll give him a damn given uh.	O
Pretty bright jacket.	O
Oh, I've been using an animation studio program called open tunes and I think they're Phil is F.	O
Photo shops isn't, she might get a little bit confused.	O
So for this you would select go down and go over.	O
Let's put the value paintings.	CHITCHAT
All about those so I don't want to like.	CHITCHAT
Obscur my goal, too much.	CHITCHAT
Because the goal really is to get better at painting and doing colors, so I don't feel like I really need to do that.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Down a little bit.	O
So it's hard to make consistent as well that inconsistent lighting.	O
I think the biggest issue with doing a manual.	O
Transposing.	O
I guess the way that you can figure out how to get your shadows to match is to see the difference between.	O
These 2 colors value wise so this ones right about there.	O
And that goes down to about 2 years to just drop that down.	CHITCHAT
That's roughly the same here, so we can get the distance of his moves down probably got a fairly consistent shadow one.	O
Dark.	O
Let me compare.	O
Probably just hide this.	O
Let me compare this guy to one if I were to.	O
Multiplayer.	O
So I guess it's a good step.	O
Then, when trying to be to match what the what the multiply should be based on?	O
The values here, so I gotta start all we just simply add a color see that's a little bit.	O
High saturation and maybe a little bit.	O
Maybe a little bit, too, bright, so drop the saturation goes down a little bit.	O
There.	O
Just kind of value match.	O
Little bit.	CHITCHAT
Well, maybe I need to change this.	O
That looks right about the same governments.	CHITCHAT
Let's colors picked that and that those are pretty soon.	O
Old are similar enough, I said maybe a little darker.	O
So now we have roughly the correct.	O
Value that we want.	O
This block out the same.	O
Same general shapes.	O
My biggest complaint with doing um multiply that can't just color pick your shadow color to go back to the normal color.	O

Normal blood mode and make that much.	CHITCHAT
It is.	CHITCHAT
One compliance with Mostly my fault for screwing up in the 1st place.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Let's see how these match up.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
This guy over here.	O
This shadows are totaly uniform, they all match all these shadows.	O
Are correct?	O
Relevant to themselves right.	O
OK.	O
So these 2 are pretty much correct and these 2.	O
Should have?	O
Very similar that the idea is that?	O
All of these will roughly match all of these that's that's the plan here.	O
That will let us know how effective are manual shadows.	O
So this is this color.	O
And this shadow is this color so shuttles are a bit darker, which isn't a bad thing by any.	O
This is a little bit more saturation to it, which means that in quite match, it correctly the first time.	O
But they're pretty close and.	O
This being darker.	O
And this being darker, but actually makes a lot of sense.	O
So that means that this one should be a bit darker than this as well.	O
But I don't know if it's.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I guess that's about right and these are actually.	CHITCHAT
These are actually matching up pretty correctly.	O
These tend to be a little less saturated.	O
The ones on the side and a little bit darker, whereas these tend to be a little bit more highly saturated.	O
And they're consistently more highly saturated, too, they're not letting.	O
Acidic.	O
So yeah across the board that tends to be the case.	O
And since this is a value painting.	O
Steam stream let's see how these look in grayscale.	O
And see how that's not good idea actually but some.	CHITCHAT
Let me take the?	CHITCHAT
Once more.	CHITCHAT
And we're going to flatten.	O
I'm going to flatten these guys out.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to try to paint.	O
And for this is going to is a little bit different painting a self shading colors instead.	O
But I'm going to try to make these colors.	O
Out of grayscale values so.	O
But I'd really like to get is.	O
By using my right my correct brush that's probably pretty good.	O
Actually let's just do a just do.	O
This one.	O
Let me make sure that I have my I might not have had it turned off.	O
Oh yeah whoops.	CHITCHAT
It's only been a little over an hour.	CHITCHAT
I think right.	CHITCHAT
That's fine will make sure to get it next time.	CHITCHAT
It was on the front of my mind before I started and I instantly forgot that's fine, though right.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That's probably not right skin tones are probably the hardest one for me.	O
This is probably.	CHITCHAT
I should be able to color pic just flat color right from the start.	O
And have it lined up correctly.	O
The helmets have been easier because it actually is just great.	O

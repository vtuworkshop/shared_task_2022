So now the question is.	CHITCHAT
Is his handkerchief on his mouth brighter or darker than his skin tone?	O
From what we learned about greens.	O
They tend to be a bit brighter, and Blues to Nubia dark be a bit darker right.	O
So I think we can safely say, that the handkerchief.	O
Is darker than its face?	O
So let's try that out.	O
Little bit darker than that?	O
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Maybe not quite that dark.	O
I had briefly turned it grace kill before an I instantly forgot so maybe this is actually I think his face to be a little bit lighter.	O
A little bit.	CHITCHAT
Maybe like that.	CHITCHAT
And then in turn, maybe bring that up a little bit too.	O
So then we have skin down here.	O
And now an interesting question, so we know that blue is a bit darker.	O
And this pinkish color.	O
Is a little bit of a mixture of red?	O
Which is a bit brighter?	O
And Blue, which is a bit darker.	O
So I think that'll on average bring.	O
But quality of it brighter than the languages.	O
See if that's correct.	CHITCHAT
To me, I feel like it's always too, dark, let's see if I'm correct.	O
Uh Oh right also for these shadows here, so similar principle.	O
We just bring these down a bit.	O
A letter Shadow edge.	O
Shut down.	O
Here.	O
There.	O
It's also.	CHITCHAT
That seems a bit too, dark to me.	O
Let's bring it up a little bit.	O
And these should be basically.	O
Although this shadow has a little bit more blue tinge to it.	O
I've done a little bit.	O
So as a reminder the idea here.	CHITCHAT
What should be happening?	CHITCHAT
Is?	CHITCHAT
These images should look just like this image when put into grayscale.	O
All right.	CHITCHAT
That's actually a pretty big difference.	O
So let's compare.	O
These are very different.	CHITCHAT
Those are very different, the handkerchief is actually very close.	O
These are very close tones, you can barely even notice a difference, so that's a good one that's the one that I thought about the most.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
The pink was significantly brighter than I expected to be skin.	O
Tone is pretty far off too, which is a bit of a shame.	O
They're not like 2 different there's an obvious difference there, but it's not the worst.	O
The shadows are actually not too far off from one another and let's see how good I got the helpless just by.	O
Picking it by I.	O
That's not too bad that's not too bad obvious difference.	CHITCHAT
But as possible for sure.	CHITCHAT
All right, so all That being said.	CHITCHAT
Let's take a look at how the colors look when they are applied so let's disable that.	O
Add a new layer above this set it to color an organ is going to start grabbing these.	O
Those there, yeah, it looks alright looks.	O

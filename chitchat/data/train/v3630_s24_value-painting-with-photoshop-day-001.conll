It looks OK.	O
Obviously, not quite right, but reasonable reasonable changes the biggest one, I think.	O
But the issue is around as the.	O
Is the color of the shirt?	O
So the one on the left was the product of manual shadow picking so putting down our flats, and then manually choosing the shadows to go around that.	O
The one in the middle was done through multiply mode using roughly the same amount of translation that the one on the left had.	O
Twin shadow so we try to get the rough.	O
Point at which the multiply would be correct and then on the right we have entirely value painting.	O
So using the The reference image to start with and then trying to match the values to each other and I wouldn't say that we failed.	O
But I wouldn't say that we really succeeded by we I mean, I don't drink you guys under this but.	CHITCHAT
Yes, that's roughly the story there.	CHITCHAT
But it's very interesting to see how that's the biggest thing for me, I think is is how the	O
Colors that look brighter.	O
Are sometimes dark and it's usually the Blues the Blues?	O
Are tricky Blues?	CHITCHAT
Are tricky once looking for interesting?	O
Will it open this is a Green Hat, but it looks very blue in these photos that caught my eye?	O
Compare that to hear where they look much more green interesting.	O
I could just be white balance actually thinking about it.	O
Let me look for some more images that we can compare and contrast.	O
Actually, we've actually just got over the 2 hour mark so I am going to.	CHITCHAT
And the stream very soon.	CHITCHAT
I'll give you guys, just a little warning not to pick it.	CHITCHAT
I don't think anybody's here.	CHITCHAT
So I don't have anybody to address about.	CHITCHAT
Uh the warning of We're going to be done soon, but I will have a bit of a gradual.	CHITCHAT
Slowing down will do a recap?	CHITCHAT
How does that sound will do a brief recap and I'll look at some more photos?	CHITCHAT
Actually, no, I never got a whole lot here to use so today.	CHITCHAT
What we did is we talked a little bit.	O
About value painting and how weird it is mostly how weird it is will save this as they want as well.	O
Call this like Dave one dash 1?	CHITCHAT
How does that sound?	CHITCHAT
I ended up not really liking.	CHITCHAT
This this pyramid all that much.	CHITCHAT
So we started out with very humble pyramids, played around a little bit.	O
I don't.	CHITCHAT
I wish that I still had my original pyramid.	CHITCHAT
So that was kind of interesting.	CHITCHAT
But we took a look at how.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Taking a single image in a single grayscale value image and giving it a color and then making a grayscale again.	O
How much that really changed it, which is.	O
Pretty fascinating I think like these are the values.	O
We got out of just transforming transforming it into a grayscale image.	O
I think that's really kind of surprising and.	CHITCHAT
I can see just how dark green is it's crazy.	O
We also did a study of Mister Obi, one Kenobi and try to see if I could manually by I.	O
Get accurate value ratings and I did a pretty poor job of that, too.	O
We have our reference here and then we also got a little character done and did some more cell shading type value painting.	O
Which is actually kind of relevant to my side project my comics that I'm working on because a lot of that is in grayscale.	CHITCHAT

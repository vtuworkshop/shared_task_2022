Based around Screentones, which might actually be another interesting topic to get into screen tones are like Gray scales, but they don't have.	CHITCHAT
Any value it's just density so it's going to be cool to see how screentones and density play a role.	CHITCHAT
Enter the grayscale aspects as well.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully this music, it seemed like some of it might not have been totally royalty, free but I'd like to keep it.	CHITCHAT
Realty free for having no conflict of interest with copyrights that would be ideal.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to maybe modern monitor my Spotify, a little bit closer in the future will have to find out.	CHITCHAT
That being said, I feel like it's been an OK first began stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm aiming to do more value focused painting as time goes by doing some more stuff like My Little City Yoda.	CHITCHAT
That that I shared earlier.	CHITCHAT
Let me just bring him up again for reference or did he go.	CHITCHAT
There is yeah.	CHITCHAT
I didn't technically open it so I don't know where it is.	CHITCHAT
I'd like to do more stuff similar to this.	CHITCHAT
And a sense of.	CHITCHAT
Starting with a grayscale image in and adding color to it.	CHITCHAT
That would be fun for me.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of what I really want to do I want to do more character art and concept art.	O
Based around grayscale values an I think grayscale is kind of like training wheels in a certain way it helps you more understand how the colors actually work together.	O
And uh.	CHITCHAT
What a reasonable range for their values are based on the color so the idea I think is the graduate from value painting.	O
That's the goal.	O
I think is to graduate from learning the values to applying those as you go.	CHITCHAT
Because it does take along time to make a value painting and some painters and artists like Tranq on yoga.	CHITCHAT
Is the best example?	CHITCHAT
I have in my mind?	CHITCHAT
He he likes to start with a value painting and then use a gradient map to get some values in there really quickly, some colors added to those values.	CHITCHAT
Rather.	CHITCHAT
And then he likes to branch off of that.	CHITCHAT
But he's really good or really great artist and I don't think it would be terribly fair.	CHITCHAT
To say that we're just going to like just do that.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I can just do what he doesn't have it worked out.	CHITCHAT
But we will get there as time goes by.	CHITCHAT
Anyways I will in the stream there, I think anybody who's coming by to look at this give this a watch it was a little bit bumpy in some spots, but uhm.	CHITCHAT
I think as time goes by will get it a little bit smoother.	CHITCHAT
There's a certain approach that's different from Twitch to be hence.	CHITCHAT
I want to have a little bit more of a serious.	CHITCHAT
And I have to catch myself every so often, not to make it a little bit too, dumb or goofy.	CHITCHAT
That being said, I hope this was enjoyable.	CHITCHAT
I hope that this was informative to some degree and I hope that this was engaging.	CHITCHAT
So I will see you guys.	CHITCHAT
Let me check my schedule here.	CHITCHAT
I think tomorrow will be back tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
After Twitch around 123 is my is my aimed time so I'll be on Twitch 1st I'll put some links.	CHITCHAT
Eventually, in the description information at the stream of my other platforms.	CHITCHAT
And I'll try to upload 2 Behance as well, which is one thing I wanted to do is.	CHITCHAT
Use behaves more as a portfolio site so will make sure to get some of that done and until then.	CHITCHAT
I'll see you guys later.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
He will hang out with this guy.	CHITCHAT
I like this guy I might use them in the future OK goodbye.	CHITCHAT
Goodnight good evening enjoy yourselves.	CHITCHAT
I'll see you later.	CHITCHAT

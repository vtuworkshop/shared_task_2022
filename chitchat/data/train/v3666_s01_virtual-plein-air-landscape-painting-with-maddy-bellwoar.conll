Um.	CHITCHAT
Let's start the tool capture so if you guys are watching this video later you'll be able to see.	O
What tools I'm using Hey Jackson?	CHITCHAT
Welcome so that's the plan for today.	CHITCHAT
As far as like the artwork inspirations that I'm going to be looking at.	CHITCHAT
And I chose a couple of references actually I'm hoping today to maybe do more than one painting usually.	O
On these streams here on Behance what I do is I work on one painting for the entire T of the stream.	O
And get into more detail.	O
I'm so sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I live in the Netherlands and people like crazy here bout.	CHITCHAT
Fireworks and basically for like 2 months leading up to New Year's Eve, you get.	CHITCHAT
Explosions and stuff going on like randomly.	CHITCHAT
It really freaks me out sometimes but it's just fireworks.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
Oh, OK anyway.	CHITCHAT
So now everyone is awake.	CHITCHAT
OK, so let's get started with the painting.	CHITCHAT
This is the first reference image that I want to use if you want to paint with me, you're welcome to take it.	CHITCHAT
It's	CHITCHAT
It's under the info panels or below the description.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to put this image on my other monitor.	O
An Macon you canvas to paint on.	O
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
Image image size, OK, so I won't make this about 2000 pixels wide.	O
I don't want to make a really big.	O
Canvas because I want to.	O
I don't want to get super detailed you know, I want these to be loose.	O
I want them to be sketches.	O
More than detailed paintings and I know that's going to be hard for me to not get sucked in.	O
Programs do my best and so another thing related to that.	O
I want to try working on these for a little bit shorter periods of time.	O
So instead of working on one painting for the whole stream.	O
I think maybe an hour to an hour and a half for a painting would be like the maximum that I want to spend.	CHITCHAT
I want to keep them loose.	CHITCHAT
I want to big textures.	O
I don't want to get into a little detail stuff, so that's my goal for today.	O
Alright so let me say this.	CHITCHAT
This is in Japan.	O
The reference.	O
And I will also put a little thumbnail of the reference using pure ref up here so let's see.	CHITCHAT
Grab that really quick.	O
So you can see the thumbnail view.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Well, it's not very big, but get this idea.	CHITCHAT
Sorry guys I just need to rearrange all my references here, so I can still see the chat Alright How Is Everybody?	CHITCHAT
By the way I hope you all are doing good.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're having a good day, so far I'm excited about this.	CHITCHAT
You know that feeling when you see a painting and then you like want to paint.	CHITCHAT
That's how I felt after.	CHITCHAT
Seeing some of those paintings that I showed you earlier today.	CHITCHAT
Hi Angie, welcome thanks for coming over.	CHITCHAT
Hi Mohammed, you're doing OK.	CHITCHAT
Are you planning to use some John Park brushes or your set that would actually be smart to use his brushes but I'm going to stick with my set.	O
Yeah, and try to familiarize myself a little bit more with it because there's a.	O
There's a few.	O
Brushes that I just added to it that I haven't really used a lot yet and I really like them.	O
So yeah, I'm going to stick with my set.	O
Nice day, but not productive as of yet well.	CHITCHAT
That's good, I'm glad it's a nice day, so far.	CHITCHAT
Same here really well, yeah, we're going to get started now.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm doing good, I'm doing good.	CHITCHAT
Let me take a look at what time it is I want to keep that in mind, so I don't?	CHITCHAT
Spend too long on this one for me, it's 12:45 so I'm going to keep an eye on the time and try to.	CHITCHAT
Keep this to about an hour and then we'll assess how much more time it might be needed.	CHITCHAT
Oh, cool my Sanji will thanks for coming over.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I'm going to talk through my process as I paint this and if you have any questions, you can let me know and.	CHITCHAT
I hope maybe some of Europeans, along so if you do.	CHITCHAT
And I hope you have fun and you can share what you do in the chat if you would like.	CHITCHAT
Hi son, So I'm going to start with a.	O
Like a Peach colored underpainting using a brush with color dynamics on.	O
I just want to.	CHITCHAT
I just want to start with something in the background.	O

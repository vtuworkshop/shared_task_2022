I know this looks a little crazy, but Sometimes it's fun to paint over something like this rather than the white canvas so that if you have a situation where you see through to the background.	O
Colour it's something just has a little bit more going on so a little bit of an underpainting.	O
And maybe I can use it to plan out the value structure slightly so there's some mountains back here.	O
Yeah, so my idea here is I just really want it to feel more like a traditional P thing.	O
So I think it will be fun, I hope so.	CHITCHAT
Then we have this pathway coming towards us a bit more shadows here.	O
It really helps to stay zoomed out if you want to do this type of work like if you want to stay.	O
Boo sketchy focus on the big picture stuff, yeah, it's best to stay zoomed out so you don't get.	O
That sucked into little details and things.	O
I really like this little stream of light over here on the right most those glasses.	O
Really, pretty.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I don't usually paint scenes looking into the light.	CHITCHAT
This is kind of a rare one for me.	CHITCHAT
The fact that we see the sun coming through the?	O
The trees over there.	O
I'm interested to see how this going how it's going to go.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to make a new layer that under painting is done, I didn't make a sketch this time.	O
I don't need that extra layer.	O
Yeah, no sketch know sketch.	O
I think maybe maybe that will help me somehow focus on shapes more.	O
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
So this is where I might experiment a little bit as I was saying, I recently.	O
Downloaded some new brushes that have.	O
Some cool textures to them and things.	O
So I'm going to try experimenting with them and see how how I can integrate them into my brush set.	O
So for the background.	O
What happens if I turn off transfer might make this brush a little bit more intense?	O
I want a blue Sky and ice blue Sky as you see in the reference but I'd like for it to.	O
Maybe show through a little bit to the underpainting if we zoom in maybe you can see, there is still a little bit of texture there.	O
Not a lot, though turn transfer back on little bit more show through.	O
Sometimes you can also use this to either the same brush or a different brush with texture.	O
You can use a textured brush as an eraser.	O
As well and in this case you know, I can erase back in to the Sky if I want little flex.	O
To show through against the other.	O
Underpainting.	O
High enough you're welcome.	CHITCHAT
Now, if anybody just joining in wants to sketch or paint along you're welcome to.	CHITCHAT
The references.	CHITCHAT
Um are available for you on the info panel or in the stream description.	CHITCHAT
You're also welcome to just hang out and relax.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I want to give a little bit of a gradient because generally I notice in painting landscapes that.	O
The Sky.	O
In the Top and often in the center.	O
Of an image is going to be a little bit.	O
Darker gradients and then as you get lower towards the horizon line.	O
You'll get more of a scion color or a bright color.	O
So a little bit, it's just nicer than a flat blue I think.	O
OK so I might try to leave the.	O
This separate from the underpainting I'm not sure but let's make a new layer.	O
And start with the foliage.	O
In the background.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's try that same brush that I was using for the initial block in.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you son, Hi Tommy's.	CHITCHAT
Metal studs for the texture brush on without transfer would lowering the flow let more show through to the underpainting.	O
Or is transferred just easier to work with that's a good that's a good idea, yeah, I don't mess with flow a lot.	O
Personally, I find transfer easier to work with just because the pressure sensitivity of the tablet will kind of work with transfer for you without making a lot of extra clicks.	O
Whereas for flow you have to come up here and adjust it manually.	O
But some people love it.	CHITCHAT
Some people love messing with the flow and it does help with getting traditional style textures, so that's a.	O
That's a good idea for anybody who wants to play with that, it might be worth it effort might be worth it.	O
For speed I kind of speak to.	CHITCHAT
Using Opacity, Hi Ebros, welcome Oh, we just started don't worry you're not very late.	CHITCHAT
We just began so all I did was.	CHITCHAT

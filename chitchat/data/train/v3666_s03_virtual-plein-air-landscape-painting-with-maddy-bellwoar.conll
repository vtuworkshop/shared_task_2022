I laid in the background sort of underpainting and we started with the Sky and now we're going to paint.	O
We're going to begin with the background, so one thing that's really pretty about this scene.	O
I think is the.	O
The atmospheric perspective.	O
If you look at the reference you can see how these more distant.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Foliage a mountain areas they have.	O
Like sort of a hint of more blue to them because of the distance and the atmosphere, it just.	O
Fades away and it helps sell the whole idea that it's further back.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And try to.	O
Settle on a sheep back here, but	O
Basically, we just want more little bit more blue.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
We still have some green, especially facing towards like the sun.	O
You can see right here on the reference.	O
So some of these forests facing towards the sun is going to still have some green.	O
And I'm not going to focus on details at all in this stage and really again.	O
I'm trying to focus on the big.	O
Picture thought this whole painting, so I don't know how detailed we will be getting but the background isn't going to be very detailed.	O
Area anyway.	O
Thanks, I think this is a good I think this one is a good challenge definitely does for me.	CHITCHAT
Trying to keep this a little bit more textured and painterly.	O
So over here on the left just going to block in.	O
I'm using a brush called rectangle texture in my brushes and I turned on color dynamics.	O
So that's why with each brush stroke.	O
It's creating this striped kind of texture, but it's really fun.	O
And it's kind of nice 'cause.	O
It sort of does some work for you at the beginning stages.	O
Um blocking in a lot of different.	O
Shades.	O
And then you can paint on Top.	O
But create some happy accidents, which is nice because.	CHITCHAT
When it comes to digital painting.	O
Versus traditional I feel like in a lot of ways, you have more control in digital so.	O
Sometimes you need to purposely create opportunities for happy accidents otherwise.	CHITCHAT
Uhm yeah, things don't have sometimes they can have less of a natural look, but there's a lot of tools like?	O
Color dynamics, you can go to shape dynamics and mess with like size jitter or angle jitter of your brushes.	O
And that will sometimes give more randomized feeling to it, and yeah, those are some things that are fun to play with.	O
Have you gotten a bit more comfortable with the mixer brush to try it on one of the shorter studies today?	O
To be honest, I haven't worked with the mixer brush at all since the last time that we talked about it, so I wouldn't say that I've.	CHITCHAT
Gotten any more practice, but I do think it would work well mixer brush would work well with what I'm trying to do with these today so.	O
I'm just going to see how things going to first begin with regular brushes and get everything blocked in.	O
I see any good opportunities to use the mixer brush then I will but not.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I don't have a set plan one way or the other.	O
I'm just going to do what feels right for the paintings.	O
Hi Marcel Good morning.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're doing good.	CHITCHAT
Right so I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Luck in this whole darker well, it's at Medium Green Medium Green in the middle.	O
And then I really am coloring I'm covering all the underpainting at this point.	O
One thing that I find kind of difficult and I've been trying to work on is the idea of.	O
Getting a painterly look to something but still having strong shapes, sometimes when you think of painterly you think of like.	O
Loose textures and things being a little less precise.	O
And I guess the artist that really inspired me the most and the work that I really love when I.	CHITCHAT
When I think of this type of Art.	CHITCHAT
That I'm trying to achieve is as other artists that managed to make something look loosen painterly but still managed to have strong?	O
Readable shapes in the artwork I think that's such a.	O

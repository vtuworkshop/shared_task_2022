Interesting combination.	O
Because they seem somewhat contradictory, but But they don't have to be so that's what I'm trying to practice with is.	O
Strong shapes, but a natural painting type of look to them.	O
Been sitting a lot lately, so I missed some of your streams.	CHITCHAT
All I hope your hope your studies have been going well.	CHITCHAT
And no worries.	CHITCHAT
I'm always happy for you to be here when you can, but I understand is busy.	CHITCHAT
Found out Picasso was a horrible person wow to be honest well.	CHITCHAT
That's sad to hear but I don't know anything about his.	CHITCHAT
My personal personal life or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
Only really know of his artwork.	CHITCHAT
That's odd.	CHITCHAT
OK, well.	CHITCHAT
There's are beginning of a background.	O
I think at this point what I'll do is merge everything except the underpainting so here's what we have now we have this layer.	O
And this one a nice thing about not merging this down yet is I can still use a brush to erase out.	O
And maybe that's too harsh of a brush does this have.	O
What brush do I want yeah something like this?	CHITCHAT
I can still erased out.	O
A little bit through to the underpainting if there's areas for example, where maybe.	O
You see through the grass is to the dirt or something like that, and we have some of these warmer colors.	O
It's up here, maybe I'm.	CHITCHAT
Just experimenting with this, but it gives a little bit more of a traditional painting look so we can erase through to underpainting little bit.	O
Let's just see how it goes will keep going.	O
Alright so I'm going to make a new layer and.	O
Go to the next.	O
Next step and I think that might be blocking in the road as it comes towards us.	O
It might be more interesting to put an angle or something in it.	O
Like maybe a little curve, it seems to be pretty straight.	O
But just compositionally.	O
I think you know meandering paths are a little bit more.	O
Give a little bit more of like a nice relaxing feeling I think versus the.	O
Straight path with so much perspective.	O
But.	O
Anytime you go off from the reference there's a.	O
Room for her so.	O
Maybe something like this.	O
You agree about the path.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that feels.	CHITCHAT
Feels OK.	CHITCHAT
So this is on its own layer, which is nice because you can go up here and press the checkerboard icon to lock the transparency.	O
And then we can paint within that layer easily so for example.	O
If I want to add any textures to the side here.	O
Little any shadows or anything or if I want to add.	O
Highlights because there's some a little bit of dappled lighting very lately.	O
Some light coming through the trees and creating a.	O
Little burst of light on the path here.	O
I don't think it needs to be wider on the Top personally.	O
I mean, it's OK if you think so.	O
I like the dramatic perspective, the smaller the smaller it is.	O
At the Top the more it looks like it's going into the distance, so for me, it's OK.	O
For me, it's OK.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to really feel like it's getting very far away.	O
Switch to a different brush something a little bit less.	O
With the dramatic.	O
Color dynamics.	O
Let's flip this.	O
Oh yeah, Marcel you should also be able to find the reference link below the screen stream description or on the info panel above the.	CHITCHAT

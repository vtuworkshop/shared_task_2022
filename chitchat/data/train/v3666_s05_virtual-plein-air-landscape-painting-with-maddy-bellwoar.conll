As much as I love dappled, lighting, I sometimes get very I find it tricky to paint it.	O
I found the pastel soft fluffy brush in my brush set sometimes works well.	O
Let's see real key I hope I'm saying Your name right.	CHITCHAT
It would be interesting to experiment with the road being a stream instead of a road would give you interesting space to play with reflections.	O
Yeah, that could be pretty.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
How much time do we have?	CHITCHAT
We do have a good amount of time left, I could I could try it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make a new layer create a clipping mask.	O
Um the problem the problem really is just without reference something like that is a little bit hard for me to.	O
Maybe wing it on, I'm trying to imagine what would water look like in this scene in this area, you know.	O
Lighting.	O
I imagine it would have really bright highlights in the place where the	O
Where the light is hitting?	CHITCHAT
Also doing that made me realize my road is way too.	O
Bright 'cause the darker one looked better.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I think you Mills.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, you were thinking of making it a stream, yeah, I'd like to see what you guys do.	CHITCHAT
I think for me, I'm going to leave it as is because without reference.	CHITCHAT
I'm really not sure how the reflections and things would work.	O
And since the goal for me with these studies is working on.	O
Textures uh an traditional look.	O
I think it's easiest for me to stay focused on my goals with the texture to not complicate the.	O
The reference thing, too much for myself.	O
So I'm going to keep it as is.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
So that means that I don't really like what I did with the.	O
The dappled lighting.	O
Let's try it one more time.	O
Wow, that color dynamics.	O
Went crazy that I change something about it.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to use the?	O
Lasso tool to make us a selection.	O
It's important for the light to also have.	O
Perspective.	O
Also, maybe I can try like overlay or something like that.	O
Hi Joe, Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Alright, well, I like that better, even though I still think.	O
Kind of tough getting my lighting.	O
Yeah, that feels a little bit better to me.	O
So one thing that I really like in the references this transition.	O
Over here on the right.	O
Between.	O
The bright bright lighting.	O
And.	O
The shadow.	O
And we get some interesting colors right there in that transition.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Some green.	O
And blue.	O
Thank you thanks for asking.	CHITCHAT
I just want to say for anyone joining the stream if you're new.	CHITCHAT
I like to do these kind of studies live and do group studies and things I think it's.	CHITCHAT
Fun way to study if you want to join in and share anything that you that you paint.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to you.	CHITCHAT
When you finish your study you can just share it in the chat if you like.	CHITCHAT

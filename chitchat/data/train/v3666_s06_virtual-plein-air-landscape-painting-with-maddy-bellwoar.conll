Isn't that blue so pretty it makes me happy?	O
There's another transition back here.	O
Like a medium.	O
Light green and then in the middle is going to be the latest part.	O
So inside of that.	O
There's another layer.	O
Of brush and grasses and things and I like to paint it dark to light in these specific situations.	O
Let me show.	CHITCHAT
I've just found from painting a lot of foliage.	O
If you have a situation like this, where there's a lot of busy stuff going on and you do see through to these dark shadows here.	O
It's and then you have like lighter foliage in front of it, it's a little bit easier to.	O
Find whatever color is like the darker color behind there.	O
Do that 1st and then paint.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
The lighter details on Top.	O
I just found that your brain will fill in a lot of stuff for you.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
For example, Now I can go and choose a lighter green and.	O
Do things like this.	O
And it makes the illusion of like just a few leaves.	O
Coming out of the shadow versus.	O
Having to draw shadows in between all those leaves I think is a lot more tedious.	O
Thanks Brandon I'm working on that for these trying to be.	CHITCHAT
Trying to be more you know loosen.	CHITCHAT
Focus on the big picture thing and it's funny how that really helps with speed.	CHITCHAT
I think a lot of times.	CHITCHAT
Out with with my with some of my paintings.	CHITCHAT
I like overthink things and I spend a lot of time on them and I find that when I do quick studies.	CHITCHAT
You know it.	CHITCHAT
I mean, not every day, sometimes sometimes you have one of those days where things don't go super smooth, but If things are going well, I generally find that these quick studies get can get a lot a cross.	CHITCHAT
Even compared to my work that I do spend more time on sometimes I wonder like is it worth the extra time.	CHITCHAT
I like the freshness of working quick.	CHITCHAT
Did you like my picture yesterday?	CHITCHAT
First time, making a vector art using photo shop, Oh that's so nice?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
That was very nice of you to share this cool that your.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so you were using vectors in photo shop do you also use illustrator for something like that?	CHITCHAT
Hi Mister Lee.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
Looking super cool.	CHITCHAT
I think I'll try these shorter study without using textures.	CHITCHAT
I realized I tend to rely on textures, waiting much.	CHITCHAT
Really that's interesting to hear Jackson I mean, I like how you use texture.	CHITCHAT
I'm always impressed.	CHITCHAT
Especially how you work, it in with the line tool painting.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, I'm interested to see.	CHITCHAT
What you're going to do?	CHITCHAT
Welcome good evening, hi there.	CHITCHAT
I like this so I notice something I don't know how true this is, but to my eye when I'm looking at this scene.	CHITCHAT
Let me color pic from back here this in the background.	O
This color reminds me of some of these Purples that I see here.	O
It's not really that close.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Just wanted to point that out, I'm noticing for example, I might be able to color pick up here.	O
Choose a little bit more of a textured brush.	O
An kind of dot in some of those Purples.	O
Preferred.	O
Yeah, it seemed clear to the dirt it kind of the dirt in the pathway kind of have.	O
These little.	O
Blue purple hues, though.	O
Tried to make vectors in AI, but it's difficult still practicing nice, yeah, I don't have a lot of experience.	O
With illustrator myself.	O
But there's a there's a lot of advantages to working with vectors.	O
For me the type of painting that I do it's not usually it doesn't usually make sense because I usually do.	O
Raster painting, I do a lot of painting with blending and things like that.	O
I don't make art that's quite clean enough to really benefit from.	O
From Vector, but I think I need to work on this area up here.	O
Doesn't quite make sense yet?	CHITCHAT

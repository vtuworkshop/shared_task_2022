I am I haven't quite gotten the look.	CHITCHAT
It feels no, the mountain felt almost see through.	O
I want a little bit more of a solid feeling here.	O
Did you frame the log painting you?	CHITCHAT
Did with the mushrooms?	CHITCHAT
I did not frame, it 'cause I'm actually planning to?	CHITCHAT
To sell that painting so I'm just storing it safely.	CHITCHAT
Pretty cool color combination high referee thank you.	CHITCHAT
I love these colors.	CHITCHAT
It's one of my favorite things.	CHITCHAT
Is uh?	CHITCHAT
The different different colors of greens different hues of Green's you know.	O
Little bit of blue green and yellow green some purple shadows.	O
This painting is like all my favorite things groups and I accidentally.	CHITCHAT
Move this layer there, we go.	O
All my favorite things in one in one place.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to merge the pathway.	O
On to the Layer below.	O
So we have.	CHITCHAT
This we have the underpainting and then everything else.	O
Yeah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I do, I drag the layer.	O

I hope you all are having a good day, so far, you're welcome to join me in the painting if you want.	CHITCHAT
You can get the reference.	CHITCHAT
Below the stream or In the info panel.	CHITCHAT
Minimal colors with maximum shade combinations.	O
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
I've been trying to push myself into other.	CHITCHAT
What's the word like motifs or color combinations color palettes, but this is just my favorite so I have a hard time.	CHITCHAT
Really going away from it.	CHITCHAT
I'm working on a series with my traditional art right now that's sort of Autumn themed an I'm trying to get myself to use.	CHITCHAT
Warmer color palettes and.	CHITCHAT
I think it's helping me learn but honestly I miss the greens.	CHITCHAT
I would paint this, I would stick with this.	CHITCHAT
Every time.	CHITCHAT
But I'm trying to push myself.	CHITCHAT
Or so says have you thought of painting a landscape on one of those big campus maybe someday but?	CHITCHAT
It's just hard for me to work on that scale right now because it's.	CHITCHAT
It's expensive an its and then once I do, make the painting it's then expensive to try to sell it.	CHITCHAT
And ship it to someone etc.	CHITCHAT
So it's just the more difficult, maybe someday, though.	CHITCHAT
Thank you owner thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
I really like impressionist art.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's right.	CHITCHAT
Ryan I'm using the same brush from yesterday.	O
This is one of my favorite brushes.	O
The it's the.	CHITCHAT
Rectangle texture in my brush set and then I turned color dynamics on.	O
So it's not a default in my in my brush set if you download it.	O
Color dynamics is not on by default on this brush you have to turn it on.	O
Just getting a little bit little bit brighter, green and yellow.	O
Back here you'll agreeing really want that.	O
Highlight to pop.	O
And we better start painting the trees and stuff, too or else I'm going to run out of time.	O
I'm trying to paint this in around maybe an hour or.	CHITCHAT
An hour and 15 minutes, something like that.	CHITCHAT
Just because I want to do other studies, too, so when I go ahead and after this one paint.	CHITCHAT
Something different.	CHITCHAT
OK so we've got a tree.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I think the Trying to figure out what I want to do for the tree trunk.	O
It looks in the reference like.	O
It's maybe a purple Hue or something like that.	O
But in reality, it's much warmer I guess there's a lot of.	O
Green bounce light, but look at that.	O
Oh, that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Mills.	CHITCHAT

Are robberies is try to combine different colors and explore combinations.	CHITCHAT
You can learn new combinations tried the same thing pretty good right now.	CHITCHAT
Nice yeah, yeah that is that is definitely a goal for me.	CHITCHAT
We get comfortable with all different kinds of color palettes different kinds of moods and environments.	CHITCHAT
I think as an artist.	CHITCHAT
It's OK and I think it's actually it can be good to have a signature.	CHITCHAT
Style or something that you are known for a really good at so I don't think it's.	CHITCHAT
Wrong to have something that's kind of your thing.	CHITCHAT
But I also want to be able to do a variety of things.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Trying to mix it up here in there, too.	O
In the distance, the path has a little splash of light, hitting it so I just want to pop that in.	O
Basically.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, all the way up here where the The grass is being lit as well that makes sense.	O
Alright I don't know if I like that.	O
That's better OK now to the tree.	O
I think I would actually I'm having trouble starting the tree so I think what I'm going to do is.	O
Focus on the Top of the tree first kind of get that shape figured out and then bring the.	O
The tree trunk down 'cause I think when you if you're looking at this from far away your notice.	O
The shape of the leaves first that you know this is kind of a summertime seen the leaves are very full.	O
The trees are full of leaves, and very lush looking.	O
So I think it might make sense to just focus on those shapes 1st.	O
That's what's reading and.	CHITCHAT
We can add.	O
The chunks.	O
So I started with a darker green.	O
But I want to go a little bit more saturated and a little bit more yellow.	O
There's a lot of light shining through.	O
These trees So it might be nice.	O
To get that really glowing green.	O
All thanks thank you every.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm having trouble seeing what's going on here there's 2 trees close to each other.	O
The leaves are overlapping and it's getting a little bit confusing.	O
I'm going to turn off this layer and try one more time I just didn't like how that was looking a little too messy.	O
Even though the references have a lot of overlap or there's a lot of overlap in the reference.	O
I'm going to try to.	CHITCHAT
Do my own thing a little bit and just make it.	CHITCHAT
I don't know maybe a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Clearly, maybe will take out one of the trees or change something.	O
Hopefully will make the reference a little bit more or the painting a little bit more readable we can change things from the reference.	O
So let's try so we have another tree here and this one is kind of this type of shape.	O
And it's a little bit more like dense there's not a lot of space to the leaves.	O
He www.brgd thank you.	CHITCHAT
Does this remind you of pastels?	CHITCHAT
I think it does have that I can I can see that I can see that Mills?	CHITCHAT
I think it does have a pastel kind of look?	CHITCHAT
Although I haven't used pastels alot, myself, so I can't say as far as from the creation aspect?	CHITCHAT
What similarities they are but.	CHITCHAT
There are but I do think it kind of has a little similar vibe Aesthetic Wise.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's see for the next tree.	O
Yeah, I'm going to make these little bit smaller.	O
Maybe a little bit further away.	O
I will go to the next Trian.	O
Maybe I will make a selection one thing that I found can be really handy.	O
Is some?	CHITCHAT
Making a selection of the tree shape and maybe some areas that you want there to be.	O
Leaves things like this and then you can take a nice textured brush.	O
An paint within that selection, larger an more loose than you.	O

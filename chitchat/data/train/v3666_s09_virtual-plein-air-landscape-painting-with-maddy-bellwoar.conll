My otherwise be able to because.	O
You can just scribble anything inside that selection, so it's really fun.	O
Weight paint stylize kind of trees.	O
That being said, I do want to go outside of that shape 'cause I wanted to look a little bit more natural.	O
But it's a nice way to start your shape to make sure there is a strong shape.	O
So this is where the reference is getting confusing this history overlaps.	O
The other one a little bit and so.	O
Is getting a little messy and it's OK for things that overlap especially in nature?	O
You know it looks more natural I think.	O
But for some reason I was getting was getting confused and I was trying to Interpret the reference.	O
Yeah, Luckily we can just resize things that's a nice thing about digital as well.	O
You Bros, it's like.	CHITCHAT
It's easy to especially when stuff alone separate layer, he can just move it around resize it.	O
Duplicate it lots of stuff.	O
I want to experiment with a couple different texture brushes to create this kind of random chaos in the tree.	O
All of my brushes are.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
All my brushes are available if you want to download them under the info tab so any of the ones I'm using today you can find there.	O
Yeah, Mills.	CHITCHAT
It's a really clever.	CHITCHAT
I think I can't remember who I initially saw doing that, but I know it's a?	CHITCHAT
I know it's like a popular way to do.	CHITCHAT
To get some nice shapes and stylized things.	CHITCHAT
Or just yeah begin?	CHITCHAT
With painting something.	CHITCHAT
Using the lasso tool.	CHITCHAT
So this brush also has the color dynamics on so it's adding a lot of these little textures without me, even having to.	O
Choose every time you know what the new color is going to be, it's really great.	O
So this is now I merge these together and um.	O
I'm going to lock the transparency.	O
And that way I can start adding highlights and it's only going to add them within the tree shape.	O
I'm gonna switch to a little bit of a softer.	O
Dr brush to get some, like a feeling of a glow in the trees.	O
Alright I'm going to.	CHITCHAT
Go back and erase out a little bit from the trees, too, and.	O
I might choose a brush where I actually kind of specifically erase out what I want sometimes you know you guys have seen I like to use texture brushes a lot.	O
But sometimes you just have to go in and kind of do things by hand.	O
Like I don't know exactly if I have any brushes that would erase out exactly what I want.	O
So I'm just going to go and scribble some things maybe a brush like.	O
Yeah, maybe something like this.	CHITCHAT
Could blend those a little bit.	O
But I like having these openings.	O
To see through this to the Sky.	O
OK, well, I think it's time to work on the branches of the tree.	O
Trees so I'm going to do this on another layer.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Choose a deep Brown maybe towards.	O
Purple I'm honestly, not 100% sure what kind of color.	O
I want to use for this so.	O
I'm just going to start and then we can always Hue shift until it looks right.	O
That's what I do when I'm not having a vision for what the color should be.	O
Also I'm noticing right now that my tree.	O
Doesn't really line up in the same place as the reference does as far as like?	O
The silhouette of the tree in the background highlights so we can just make these a lot bigger.	O

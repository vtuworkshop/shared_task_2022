So Luckily pretty easy to do.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I'm going to right now, I'm only worried about the shape of the branches of the tree that I'm painting, I'm not really worried about the color at all.	O
Because we can.	O
Hue shift and try new things really easily so.	O
Just right now focus on the shape try to make it interesting.	O
There's a lot of branches.	O
Intertwining and overlapping and reaching out trees have beautiful gestures to them.	O
Alright so I think I like the shape OK.	CHITCHAT
And I will go to image adjust Hue saturation and we can just maybe desaturate darken lighten you see it's just until it looks right.	O
So it's really handy also since it's on its own layer.	O
We can lock the layer and I can apply shading and things within that, so there's actually a lot going on if you look at the reference.	O
Zoom in on that tree.	O
Let me show and sorry it's very pixelated at this zoomed in amount, but	O
Oh yeah, we can look at that so the left side of the tree is going to be a little bit warmer.	O
Makes sense through the lights coming from.	O
So we can kind of give a little bit of a gradient.	O
And the right side will be more purple have some purple bounce light.	O
You're probably gonna finish this earlier than you thought that's crazy, that's crazy, I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm I'm happy this one is going smoothly that's not always the case.	CHITCHAT
But this one is going together.	CHITCHAT
Quickly.	CHITCHAT
Himera welcome.	CHITCHAT
So I will lock the layer again and maybe add a little bit of texture to the bark.	O
Just a little bit.	O
Thank you Maria.	CHITCHAT
Don't forget the drawing, the white arrows, writer for the add something doesn't it.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I am going to add the highlight like a rim light.	O
Which is?	CHITCHAT
This satisfying part of any painting.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
See the	CHITCHAT
Warm bright rim light on the tree it's pretty sharp highlights.	O
In a couple of places an one area that's almost almost like pure white.	O
There's a really bright spot hitting.	O
Although I have to be careful 'cause.	CHITCHAT
Does it make sense?	CHITCHAT
I know I didn't paint everything in my.	O
Painting exactly where it is in the reference so I just want to make sure that where I'm putting the light.	O
The highlights is actually working and I think it's OK.	O
Yeah, I don't mind if things aren't exactly the way they are in the reference as long as it looks good and it works.	O
I'm focusing more with this study on.	CHITCHAT
You know textures and practicing with stylizing things so it's OK, yeah, if they're not quite the same and everything.	O
Thanks, Ryan.	CHITCHAT
Love the colors and how the background turned out like a JPEG artifacting somehow wielded by artists witchcraft thanks.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's so weird thing with the with the colour dynamics with that striping effect sometimes it's.	O
I'm wondering like him and I purposely.	CHITCHAT
Like distorting my painting what am I really doing here, but I think it looks so cool.	CHITCHAT
But there's a lot of artists whose work I really love and they have given me good inspiration and how to?	CHITCHAT
Use color dynamics in a way that.	CHITCHAT
That makes things feel a little bit more traditional and I'm trying.	CHITCHAT

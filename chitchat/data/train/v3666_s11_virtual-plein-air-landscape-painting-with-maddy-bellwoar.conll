I'm trying to.	CHITCHAT
Trying to bring it into my paintings.	CHITCHAT
Really glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, I am in.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to lock the layer and.	O
Dark in Some of the shadows on the tree in just a couple of places.	O
And I think we'll be ready to merge this down.	O
I really like to merge layers as soon as I get to a certain point, I'd like to keep them separate so that.	O
It makes a lot of things easier when you're in the painting process.	O
But whenever I finally decided OK I like where this is I want to keep it there.	O
At that place I like to merge so that I can feel like I can paint more freely after it's merged.	O
Get more traditional kind of feeling.	O
So I'm going to try to be brave and merge this.	O
So here we go.	CHITCHAT
So now I just have the underpainting an everything else.	O
Yeah, I'm taking a look at the time so I think we have, maybe like.	CHITCHAT
1015 more.	CHITCHAT
Minutes.	CHITCHAT
On this one for me.	CHITCHAT
So what can I do to help I think on the left hand side to help us feel nice?	CHITCHAT
Finished.	CHITCHAT
Now there's a few things.	O
All the foliage on the left.	O
Is it's in shadow so it's OK in my opinion for it to be a little bit less detailed it's in shadow an it's not.	O
The focal area That being said it's a bit too, loose at the moment.	O
So I'm going to work on this one tree a little bit more and then I'm going to go over there and.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Clean things up a little bit.	O
So I'm trying to look at the big shapes that I see in the reference and basically seeing some.	O
Some, like tears Blackwood better explanation of levels of leaves, and Bush is that overlap.	O
And so rather than focusing I want to focus on any individual leaves yet, but I want to get that kind of.	O
Organization, where we can understand the.	O
What's in front?	O
What's behind?	O
Get some form explained with all this massive foliage.	O
Hi Waqas welcome.	CHITCHAT
So there's also a tree that comes out into the light more so it's something like this.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and so we get a little bit of a feeling of the leaves kind of hanging down.	O
A little bit more yellow green to this one.	O
We have a little bit more light shining through.	O
So I will lock that layer because I want to add a little bit more bright yellow green so anywhere that there's an opening to the Sky.	O
And in between these leaf groupings that's a place where I might put a little bit more yellow green.	O
Alright so I'll make a?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, merge those 2 layers.	O
There's also a couple little clouds in the Sky.	O
But they're very, very wispy and barely there an I wonder if.	O
It's a good idea to try to add them, or if I should just kind of forget about it because.	O
They're barely barely there.	O
But we can play with the idea, a little bit.	O
Maybe have some little it just makes the Sky look a little bit more.	O

I don't know alive to have a little bit of something going on there.	CHITCHAT
Some little happy little clouds.	CHITCHAT
And the reference the clouds are pretty overexposed.	O
So you don't get a lot of information.	O
So I have to kind of.	CHITCHAT
Make my own decisions on that.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe just the Maybe just a couple little wisps is enough.	CHITCHAT
Going to look up a little more breaks in the tree here into the through the Sky little bit more openings.	O
You like the happy little cloud accents thank you.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Lee says my blurry attempts OK.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for painting with me.	CHITCHAT
Let's see what he has done here.	CHITCHAT
Cool wow that perspective reads really well.	CHITCHAT
Nicely done Lee this is elizar in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Magenta is really cool.	CHITCHAT
I love it when you add these Purples and Magentas.	CHITCHAT
Very cool colors like these little hints of detail on the grass is.	CHITCHAT
If anybody else, wants to paint or draw along you're welcome, too.	CHITCHAT
I like to see what you're creating.	CHITCHAT
Hebrews says will you make the sun behind the tree?	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, I kinda forgot about it to be honest.	CHITCHAT
Let's try.	CHITCHAT
Let's try and see how it looks.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll not put it in the exact same spot as a reference.	CHITCHAT
But let's see about that, maybe we can add it.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
I found that when you're doing the traditional style painting.	O
Sometimes those kind of effects don't always look great what I mean, is like lens flares and stuff like that.	O
Sometimes it looks.	O
That stuff looks more digital and it doesn't fit as well, you know any.	O
Traditional looking digital painting.	O
But what I could do is like a really, really bright like this, I can just make the space in between the trees.	O
Really really bright over here.	O
And that might help make it look like the sun is just right behind there.	O
How long are you streaming 40 that's a good question.	CHITCHAT
Let's see I started about an hour ago and I think I'm going to be streaming around 4:00 or so hours today.	CHITCHAT
So I have about 3 hours left most likely but we'll see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can go a little longer, but will be around that time.	CHITCHAT
I think you are mad.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that really bright spot coming through could be cool and.	O
You know, maybe we'll see emerged a lot of things.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
I can make a new layer and put it on color Dodge or linear Dodge or something like that.	O
Let's try linear Dodge.	O
And put my brush mode on linear Dodge and.	O
Maybe use a soft like a light texture and see about adding a little bit of.	O
Of late here and in the Sky as well.	O
So just to make it more clear that the.	O
There's like this is brightness coming from the left.	O
I think it can work I want to go to.	O
Go too far with it, I'm going to erase back into that a little bit.	O
All right.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
See.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think I am almost let's let's finish, wrapping this up.	O

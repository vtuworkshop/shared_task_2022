I think I think it could use a little bit more time.	CHITCHAT
I know for a while, there, it looked like it was going to.	CHITCHAT
Finish right around the hour mark working on this, but I think it could use a little bit more time.	CHITCHAT
That would really, really benefit over here on the left side specially so let's keep going.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to feel finished and then we'll go onto.	O
Another one, will do another one of these, and I'd really like to do at least 3 studies today.	O
So that's the that's the plan so there's a lot of chances if anybody wants to join in.	CHITCHAT
One you're welcome to.	CHITCHAT
And you don't have to.	CHITCHAT
Feel like you need to paint it in in one hour or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
Jack thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
How do you like it?	CHITCHAT
If you guys are.	CHITCHAT
Interested in seeing some of my art inspirations for for this.	CHITCHAT
I've put a couple of artists names below in my stream.	CHITCHAT
Description those are some of my my influences, I'm trying to learn from.	CHITCHAT
And that would be.	CHITCHAT
John Park and Clement Tingri, I hope I'm saying the name right.	CHITCHAT
I really like, how they use.	CHITCHAT
Digital painting, but with a traditional kind of look and feeling so I'm trying to work on that.	CHITCHAT
Over here, we get some leaf shapes hanging out over the.	O
The shadows.	O
And this is exactly what I was talking about earlier feeling like the.	O
Dark to light is helpful because.	O
We can sort of hint that this kind of thing earlier more easily.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Look up the morning details of the leaves.	O
Maybe I can try another brush as well.	O
Something that.	CHITCHAT
Maybe will hit that that texture more.	O
I want a little bit more of a subtle transition between the.	O
The grass and all the bushes and things so I'm just going to.	O
Light repeating some texture down here.	O
I'm on the edge of the pathway.	O
Let's make it feel more grounded.	O
We add the darker Bush is on the right in the distance.	O
Oh, I wasn't going to to be honest but.	CHITCHAT
I could try if you think if something's missing.	CHITCHAT
Working on another layer right now, so it doesn't hurt to it.	O
Sketch in back here and see what it looks like.	O
Maybe a little extra.	O
Noisy Ness would be good.	O
Little bit more transition between the detail area in the.	O
The distant.	O
More simplified parts of the landscape.	O
There's another thing I struggled to add which was like a highlight on the mountain up here.	O
I couldn't say what color to make it I can't really tell what color it is in the reference maybe something like this?	O
Looks like it gives more depth.	O
Yeah, I think I like it more too.	CHITCHAT
Wood burner, Dodge be a little more subtle touches and blend smoother.	O
Burn or Dodge.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
I guess if you're comfortable using those you could I don't really use them so much now do you mean?	CHITCHAT

Like a layer blending mode or a the burner, Dodge Tools on the toolbar.	O
Asking for your own reference I find.	CHITCHAT
I find that.	CHITCHAT
You for me, I like painting as much as I can on the normal layer because I feel like.	O
I feel like it gives the most natural results.	O
I wouldn't really suggest in landscape painting, although.	O
You know, everyone is different and I'm sure somebody can make it work.	O
I'm sure you could make it work, but I really wouldn't suggest using the?	O
Like the burn tool or Dodge tool here.	O
It might work well for like photo editing and different things.	O
But for painting your kind of better off if you want.	O
Burner Dodge effects going to making a new layer and choosing like a color Dodge or color burn or multiply or overlay.	O
Some of these layer blending modes will have better.	O
Affects for this.	O
Also, you can.	CHITCHAT
You can even turn your brush mode on to some of these effects and that will work nicely too.	O
But that would be my suggestion.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think I think there's a lot of overlap between photo editing and digital painting, but then some.	O
Things are probably better, more for one rather than the other.	O
Right so I think I'm a screencap this and get a full size back then, too late.	CHITCHAT
Oh my God.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's like the most surprising in a specific compliment.	CHITCHAT
I'm imagining to get thank you with the.	CHITCHAT
Photoshop window and everything wow that would be the most unique tattoo in existence.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hi Marina, so it's been around an hour of painting right now.	CHITCHAT
By the way if anybody missed if you want to see it from the beginning after the stream is over.	CHITCHAT
The video just takes a little time to process and then it will be available on my page under the videos tab.	CHITCHAT
You can watch everything from the beginning.	CHITCHAT
We started from a blank canvas.	O
So if you want to go back and watch that as possible to see.	O
Later, but yeah, it was around an hour or so.	CHITCHAT
Uhm OK, so I think I'm going to merge this down.	O
Make a new layer and the last thing that I want to work on is just this tree in the middle.	O
Not the big one on the right, but this one right here.	O
There's a little bit more interesting things going on in it than what I was able to capture so I want to add a little bit of.	O
Like shadows and highlights basically you can see in between the branches a little bit.	O
There's some bright patches of light coming through.	O
Where the trees like thinner and I think it's really pretty?	O
I think it would be nice.	O
To get some of that.	O
In the painting here.	O
I'm going to paint the background.	O
Through there.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I saved a few.	CHITCHAT
References to use today.	CHITCHAT
I want to do a couple more studies and there's some.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll share the references with you if anybody wants to join in but I find these references through a website called?	CHITCHAT
Map crunch com which I love.	CHITCHAT
I'm like spending way too much time on there.	CHITCHAT
But it's it's a website that basically let's you search through and get random images from Google Street View basically it's Google Street View Images.	CHITCHAT
But you can just click through an it'll give you like random ones or you can search within specific.	O
Country or area.	O
And it's really nice for.	O
Getting painting practice and a lot of different subjects and things because.	O
You know the whole world is possible.	CHITCHAT
Painting.	CHITCHAT
At least anywhere where the Google Maps car has been so there's stuff all over the place.	CHITCHAT
Lots of different.	CHITCHAT
Options so I've been painting, a lot of different places on my streams here.	CHITCHAT
If you want to check out any of the past videos, you can see, there's.	CHITCHAT
Some in the desert some some in more lush environments some in some with buildings.	CHITCHAT

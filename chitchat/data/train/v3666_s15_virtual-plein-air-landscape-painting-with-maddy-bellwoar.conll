I'm on the last bit here for me, I just want to put a little bit of there's some little plants.	O
Growing here on the right and they have some more warm colors.	O
In the stems.	O
And then some nice bright green leaves larger leaves.	O
I'm not sure exactly what type of plants these are.	CHITCHAT
But I think it looks pretty against the more blue green.	O
Over here and it brings some.	O
Little bit of that.	O
Bright light.	O
Into the foreground I guess.	O
Some dappled lighting.	O
Hi Andrew Man.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Going to choose a different brush for painting in these details.	O
It's so much closer to us than.	O
Mostly everything else in the painting so I want to.	O
Maybe a little bit more precise how I paint it.	O
So it's basically just little dappled light.	O
Spots of lighting these.	O
Leaves.	O
And we got a nice yellow want to go a little bit more towards Green get a very saturated.	O
Green.	O
And maybe that's too much.	O
But there's some area where the The light shining through these leaves and they get an Icicle Oh, so pretty.	O
That's Hi Carol, how are you?	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I think we're on the finishing touches now last thing I'm going to do is sometimes at this stage.	CHITCHAT
I will.	O
Do some finishing effects with the airbrush I will show you guys what I like to do.	O
Make a new layer above everything else, I have a blank layer, he will get rid of.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I like to make my airbrush really large and kind of paint a big network effect around the outside.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes, all Hue shift that and decide what color I want it to be so for example, you know, do we want?	O
Blue purple.	O
Something warm I think a purple is nice.	O
And I will just.	O
Lower the Opacity 'cause I want it to be barely there, but just darkening the outside a tiny bit.	O
I don't want it to be really be noticeable.	O
But it just kind of directs your eye towards the inside of the picture, a little bit more.	O
Nice work I love thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Some last color effects, we can do, I'm going to make another new layer an try maybe screen mode.	O

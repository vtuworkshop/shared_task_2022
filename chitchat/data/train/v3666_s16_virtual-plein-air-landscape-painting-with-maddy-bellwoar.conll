Is?	CHITCHAT
Going to get a saturated blue purple.	O
Open paint in a little bit of a glow the Airbrush.	O
In the Over the mountains in the distance and it's too much a lot of times when I paint in these effects.	O
I just go pretty intense with them at the beginning because I like to.	O
Really see what I'm doing see what the effect is and then I'll like lower.	O
The layer opacity until it's the amount that I want.	O
But it helps me to like really see what I'm doing to paint it in pretty heavily when I'm doing these kind of things.	O
And then you know lower, it until it looks good.	O
Thank you thank you.	CHITCHAT
But in the do some artwork I can, relax, the last we going to the beach for straight hours, it was wonderful.	CHITCHAT
That's really nice, yeah, the beach going to the beach going to the forest.	CHITCHAT
Things like that, really good for.	CHITCHAT
For inspiration and Yeah, rebuilding your creative Energi.	CHITCHAT
That's one thing that is a little difficult for me during the winter.	CHITCHAT
Because I don't I don't go out and spend time in nature, quite as much as.	CHITCHAT
In other times of the year and I.	CHITCHAT
I definitely miss it.	CHITCHAT
I need to kind of force myself to go out even though it's cold.	CHITCHAT
It really does it does feel good?	CHITCHAT
Alright so will merge these down, I think the very last thing could be uhm.	O
Last little brightness right on that Patch of grass coming through so make a new layer we can try.	O
Putting the layer on color Dodge mode.	O
I'm also going to throw a black paint bucket on the layer.	O
So it's Yeah, 100% black layer and then on color, Dodge Mode, someone taught me this trick if it's a really cool way of.	O
It just creates a little bit of a different effect with the color, Dodge and makes it a little bit more.	O
Which is a little bit more saturation?	O
I just causes the colors to behave a little bit differently so you can try it and see.	O
If you like it.	O
But we can pop a little glitter here.	O
Again, it's too much.	CHITCHAT
For me.	CHITCHAT
But maybe can lower the opacity after that.	O
Say OK alittle bit of that is good.	CHITCHAT
One thing I probably could have done before getting into all those details is I was thinking about adding some more.	O
Details to the tree.	O
I think if I'm going to critique my own work.	CHITCHAT
That's the area that I could have.	CHITCHAT
I could have done something a little bit more with is this tree.	O
There's a lot of negative space in the Sky.	O
And it would be nice if this tree.	O
Had some more branches projecting out into the Sky.	O
That would kind of activate the.	O
The negative space.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can paint them in by hand.	O
I was kind of looking for a brush.	O
That was going to maybe give me some of those effects.	O
There's branches coming out in lots of different directions.	O
Yeah, so.	CHITCHAT
I can come back.	CHITCHAT
Over some of those.	CHITCHAT
I have not I have not tried that Mills.	CHITCHAT
I have not tried any of the those kind of things with overlay.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I can't tell I can tell if I prefer that.	CHITCHAT
Well, I think it's done, I don't want to get stuck fiddling with things at this point in the painting.	CHITCHAT

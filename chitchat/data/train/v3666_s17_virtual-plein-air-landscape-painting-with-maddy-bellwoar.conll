Because.	CHITCHAT
Then we won't will get stuck and we won't get a chance to move on and paint something else, which I want to do today?	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I will call this finished.	O
Is this hand drawn?	CHITCHAT
Yes yes if anybody wants to see later the whole process of painting this you're welcome to.	CHITCHAT
Watch the video once it's processed after stream will be uploaded on my channel.	CHITCHAT
The videos tab are on my page here and be hands.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
You can see it if you want.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
This one was about an hour let's see.	CHITCHAT
An hour and 15 minutes or so.	CHITCHAT
Maybe a little bit longer.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's do another painting.	O
After decide what the next one is going to be.	O
I collected some references for the stream today.	O
So let's see.	O
I want to do something with a little bit of a different.	O
Mood.	O
A lot of the references that I chose involved foliage 'cause.	O
This is one of the things I really want to work on.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking something like this.	CHITCHAT
Um has a cool mood.	CHITCHAT
Another landscape something a little bit more cloudy and Moody.	O
This is in Spain.	O
And there's also some cool like little city down here, something but I like these trees and bushes and the textures, another winding path.	O
It's going to be some similarities in the one that we did, but a different mood.	O
So I will add this one.	O
The information for this reference to the description below the stream if you want to.	CHITCHAT
Use it and paint with me.	CHITCHAT
One moment to do that.	CHITCHAT
And I will share a screenshot of it as well.	O
By the way if anybody painted with me for the last painting that I just finished if you want to share your welcome to.	CHITCHAT
You can post it in the chat.	CHITCHAT
If you're a URL to your artwork.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's begin with the Next One I will replace this reference.	O
It's updated OK cool nice that was fast.	CHITCHAT
All right, Jackson might take for this one, I didn't use the textured eraser like the others in the past.	O
Ooh I'm very curious.	CHITCHAT
Oh, wow.	CHITCHAT
What do you think Jackson I think this is awesome?	CHITCHAT
So Jackson Joker in the chat is doing uh.	CHITCHAT
Did a study with us this is using the line tool?	CHITCHAT
Which is really a crazy challenge to do if you've ever tried it?	CHITCHAT
It's yeah it's a difficult challenge.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
The lighting and everything came out awesome.	O
It's such a happy feeling I love the colors.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it came out so well, even without any you know eraser textures, like you were talking about.	O
Very cool, I like that.	CHITCHAT
Hey Glenn, Now, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for sharing your work.	CHITCHAT
Well, it, I don't know if it was how you feel about it after doing it versus the ones with the.	CHITCHAT
Texture eraser it looks it doesn't look you made.	CHITCHAT
It look easy as I'm going to say it doesn't look like you were having a big struggle.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if behind the scenes.	CHITCHAT
You found it difficult to do.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I've been you canvas that I'll be using to paint the next one, an let's put the reference up here.	O
But whoops that's Jackson's painting.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let me try again to get the proper reference here.	O
There we go.	O
And maybe will zoom in a little bit something like this.	O
Be nice.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's see we're going to make this a little bit bigger maybe.	O

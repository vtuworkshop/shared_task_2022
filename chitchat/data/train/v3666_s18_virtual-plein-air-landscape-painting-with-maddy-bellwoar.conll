2500 pixels something like that why'd?	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think this aspect ratio is good.	O
Maybe I'll make it a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Little bit less wide screen.	O
And this is in Spain.	CHITCHAT
I already did.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So if anybody is just joined the stream just to give a quick idea of what I'm doing hello.	CHITCHAT
Everyone my name is Maddie.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing virtual Plein Air Painting Studies.	CHITCHAT
So I'm using images from Google Street View I found them through a website called map crunch com.	O
And we're doing studies based on these environments on painting from these from these references trying to focus today on.	O
Textures and getting a?	O
More traditional look to my digital painting if you want to join in the references in the studies of these references.	O
You're welcome to, you can just grab the reference from below the stream or in the info panel.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
You can use my brushes as well.	O
If you want to try them out there also under the info panel.	O
So I'm going to start the next one and my goal is to spend around.	CHITCHAT
An hour between an hour and an hour and a half on it.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of depends how it goes if we struggle or if it goes smoothly, you never know.	CHITCHAT
How it's going to go so that's my plan?	CHITCHAT
Brian says do you ever take a reference and crank the saturation or contrast so you can see subtle differences?	O
Yeah, sometimes?	CHITCHAT
What helps me most is just turning into black and white.	O
That helps me get an idea of the value structure without the whole color thing confusing things so that helps me.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Oh, Kara is that a uhm.	CHITCHAT
Is that a photo you took or something that you're trying to request for us to paint?	CHITCHAT
Don't know I prefer this kind of painting or not, but I really need to keep practice with the Untextured Workflow.	O
Yeah, I think it is good practice.	CHITCHAT
It's funny.	CHITCHAT
We're doing like the opposite thing right now.	O
I'm trying to do textures.	O
You're trying to not do textures.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
OK, well, let's get started with the next painting.	O
So yeah, let's see again.	CHITCHAT
It's about 2 for me.	O
Alright well, if anybody's painting along happy painting.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to explain my workflow.	CHITCHAT
As I go through this.	CHITCHAT
And if you have any questions, you can let me know.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to begin again, with an underpainting.	O
So I'm going to choose a warm color or something similar to what I would see on the ground here is being the.	O
The dirt I guess.	O
And I am going to turn on color dynamics again.	O
It's going to be similar similar start as the last painting.	O
Um Alexander How do you use the new mega brush pack it's very cool for such paintings?	CHITCHAT
Uhm I actually haven't used it in awhile.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I do agree that call, Websters brushes are awesome.	O
I actually used to buy some of his brush packs before they started including them.	O
With the photo shop subscription so I think it's awesome.	O
Now that they are available.	O
But I don't know I like to make my own brushes and I like to tweak brushes.	O
A lot, so I'll download brush packs and then I'll.	O
Take a brush that exists an I'll change a bunch of the settings and save it as like a new preset.	O
So I end up kind of personalizing my brushes a lot.	O
Yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's that's right.	CHITCHAT
They are free.	O
Now I think it's great because I used to pay for them separately.	O
And now I don't have to.	CHITCHAT
OK so let's get started.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I think it might be nice to paint the Sky.	O
First usually with the landscape paintings.	O
I like to start with the Sky because it's furthest.	O
So it makes sense going back to front and also it help set the mood for everything.	O
So I'm going to use the same brush as I did for the last painting 'cause I think it.	O
Worked out.	CHITCHAT
Worked out pretty well for the Skysoft Sky.	O
You missed the end.	CHITCHAT
Um did I close my.	CHITCHAT
PST already.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I hope I didn't.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there, we go that's like I don't remember I don't remember closing that but yeah, here we go.	CHITCHAT

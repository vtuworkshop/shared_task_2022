This is this is the end of the last one.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and really quick if I turn off all these layers.	O
On the last painting this was the underpainting for that one so.	O
I guess actually before I start painting the Sky.	O
I almost forgot a step.	CHITCHAT
This is kind of new to me.	CHITCHAT
Um, I've kind of recently starting to use underpaintings, an experiment with them more.	O
So what might be nice in this scene is to put in a little bit of the value structure.	O
In underpainting too, so instead of justice.	O
A random color.	O
And then we have.	O
A little bit of highlight in the Sky.	O
I really like the Sky in the scene.	O
And I find cloudy days.	O
Hard to get good reference photos of.	O
A lot of since I paint a lot of scenes from map brunch and you know the Google Street View.	CHITCHAT
I notice that a lot of photos of cloudy days have ferry.	O
Um there are either really overexposed or they have a lot of HDR applied and it looks kind of a natural.	O
It's really difficult.	CHITCHAT
I'm not photographer, but it must be really difficult to photograph cloudy skies very effectively because I.	O
I just find that it's hard to hard to find good painting references of cloudy days.	O
But I like this one, I think it's really nice.	O
So just I guess the underpainting if I use it this way.	O
Can become a little bit more of a sketch?	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Something that's helping me think through where things are going to go.	O
Hey Rafi, Ah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hi Allison, So there's Couple.	CHITCHAT
Trees or Bush is here.	O
I'm going to like a shorter wide one taller.	O
One next to it.	O
Happy little trees and brushes.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
So I think that's OK to start with so now we can go into the Sky Finally.	O
All right so.	CHITCHAT
I will choose a very, very light blue Gray.	O
I'm trying not to color pic from the reference.	O
I'm trying to just look at this.	O
And see what it is so I think a very light blue.	O
Gray color.	O
For the Layer one of the Sky.	O
I'm just going to paint over.	O
The background.	O
And I think.	CHITCHAT
So I think it makes sense to kind of work.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Light to dark in this in this situation so we have a light.	O
Background of the Sky and now I can go in and paint.	O
Some of the darker clouds that are starting to create shadows.	O
I'm going to make a selection.	O
Of this cloud shape here and use a brush called soft shading and blending in my brush set.	O
And I really like the Sky to me already even in the reference kind of has a look.	O
Of a painting.	O
I notice that clouds can often get that look just the way that the way that they naturally form.	O
Can often look wispy and like paint strokes?	O
There's a lot of like energean.	O
Movement.	O
Good take the smudge brush and smudge out.	O
Some of these.	O
Details in the Sky and of those hard edges.	O
It's nice to have a little bit of hard edges.	O
That's one thing that I notice painting.	O
Painting clouds is the edge play like having hard and soft edges and where to blend them is really.	O
Really important in making it look like a?	O
Make a real cloud.	O
Is this a draft drawing it is a sketch so it's just for study?	O
Just a quick study.	CHITCHAT
I picked a color with a tiny bit of warmth.	O

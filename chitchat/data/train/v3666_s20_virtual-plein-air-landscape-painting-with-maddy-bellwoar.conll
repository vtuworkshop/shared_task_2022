To start putting these highlights coming through the clouds.	O
I would guess thank you.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
And then in the area that's Cloudy that's more cloudy there's also going to be areas where the clouds are happily kind of a glow to them.	O
I think it's just take a little bit of back and forth.	O
There was a day recently.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Near where I live I live in the Netherlands and there was like we get a lot of cloudy days, especially in autumn.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
There was such a pretty Sky.	CHITCHAT
I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I didn't take a photo of it.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure what I've come out anyway on my Phone.	CHITCHAT
As it looked in person, but it was a cloudy day was cloudy Sky.	CHITCHAT
But there were so many colors coming through the clouds like was full cloud color cloud cover but the clouds had like.	CHITCHAT
Some of them have had a blue hand.	CHITCHAT
Some of them had like yellow like a Peach color and it was just.	CHITCHAT
A little bit, it wasn't like it didn't look like.	CHITCHAT
Supernatural or anything, but it just made me realize how much.	CHITCHAT
Clouds are not just Gray you know you imagine like Oh, it's a grey cloudy day but there's often times a lot of.	O
Subtle little color shifts in the clouds.	O
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Alexander Yeah.	CHITCHAT
See you another time, it would be great if you joined us painting.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, anyone is welcome to join in if you like.	CHITCHAT
I always share the references that I use for painting and if you want to join in doing a study.	CHITCHAT
We can.	CHITCHAT
Paint along an?	CHITCHAT
Share what you do.	CHITCHAT
And it's OK, if you're a beginner, too don't feel don't feel intimidated.	CHITCHAT
Any any skill levels welcome and if you have any questions.	CHITCHAT
You can ask me.	CHITCHAT
If I don't know the answer.	CHITCHAT
Maybe somebody else does.	CHITCHAT
Well, I think that's OK as a start for the Sky.	O
I want to do more, but I don't want to.	O
Start getting too detailed with the Sky when the other areas.	O
The painting are not even blocked in yet so.	O
I'll merged the skies is all in one layer an will get going with the next.	O
Which we will do I think we can start with the?	O
The Hills and then on Top of that will do trees and bushes, and little grass is an all these textures and everything.	O
Hi love how are you?	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I will probably go back to my trusty.	O
Rectangle texture brush and.	O
Pick something that has a little bit more.	O
Yeah, a little bit more towards yellow or desaturated.	O
I like this, this peachy color for the underpainting.	O
But I think for to get the really get the mood of this scene.	O
I want to go a little bit more dull a little bit more muted.	O
With the colors.	O
But it's very it's very.	CHITCHAT
Still see through I think if I turn off the background layer you can see how much the marks that I'm using?	O
Right now, I have a transfer on so.	O
They're not full opacity Ann.	O
We really are seeing through a lot to that background, you know if I was painting with such as the white.	O
Canvas.	O
That's what the painting would look like.	O
So it is making use of the underpainting even though.	O
We're changing the color a little bit more towards something different.	O
All thanks love.	CHITCHAT
I hope so.	CHITCHAT
I'll do my best.	CHITCHAT
I picked up some more a little bit more simple straightforward references today.	CHITCHAT
Not that they're easy because I don't think any paintings really easy.	CHITCHAT
But I think.	CHITCHAT

Yeah, I just wanted to pick stuff that didn't have for example, lots of buildings and cars and.	O
You know really complicated stuff because I wanted to focus more on style and texture, so taking away a little bit of that complication is letting me really relax.	O
An I work on.	O
Style things.	O
I noticed for myself if I really want to study something it's nice to take away some of the other variables that are difficult.	O
So you can really focus on that one thing.	O
So now I'm just starting with some of these different colors.	O
On the Hills.	O
There's all kinds of different plants and foliage and weeds and you know.	O
Kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Different colors.	CHITCHAT
Different colors green greens.	O
I love the slightly different colors, slightly different shades of Green.	O
So for example.	O
Little bit darker.	O
Got here.	O
And you can see it's up here in my reference.	O
Bringing this.	O
Later, Green and see that's not quite the right color.	O
Sometimes it takes me.	O
Awhile to find the right color.	O
Without color picking you know gotta try it, see what it looks like.	O
It's not working.	CHITCHAT
Well, is it?	CHITCHAT
Is my version too warm or too cool off with it and then you can adjust the right color?	O
The texture of the brushes, making now looks really crisp, thanks rocky.	O
I think this brushes interesting an really any brush that you use color dynamics on especially if it also has.	O
This brush has dual brush and.	O
Color dynamics, so let me show you something really quick on a separate layer about how it works.	O
So because it has color dynamics on and apply per tip.	O
It's causing this striping effect if I Uncheck.	O
Apply per tip, then, instead of changing the color with every single.	O
Stamp of the brush it's going to change the color every time I make a new brush stroke.	O
Which is really nice also if you're going for like an impressionistic painting look 'cause you can sit here and paint a bunch of colors next to each other.	O
And you don't even have to choose any color every time you can just.	O
You know say how much you want the color to vary from the original color.	O
But anyway because of this.	O
Texture and dual brush.	O
If I'm painting lighter.	O
It really blends the.	O
The striping a little bit and makes it not so dramatic so if I want to press since I'm using transfer.	O
If I want to press harder on my tablet, then you get a nice this striped texture and if I.	O
If I go lightly, it kind of overlaps an creates a less dramatic version of that so.	O
One of my favorite things and this is just kind of.	CHITCHAT
I don't know that this really affect so much in the results of your painting, but just during the process of making a painting.	CHITCHAT
I really like to find things like that that make it nice to use like the workflow is important to me.	CHITCHAT
When I'm painting, I want to enjoy the process of painting and I want it to be.	CHITCHAT
I want to be relaxing and nice and one of the things I like if I find a brush that's.	O
Super versatile or something that I can.	O
Yeah, easily make a bunch of different marks with without going to my brushes and switching to a different brush.	O
I really like that kind of stuff an kind of the same thing with the.	O
Setting up shortcuts and things like that, for yourself.	O
I'm a big fan.	CHITCHAT
I could probably add even more shortcuts than what I use.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like trying clue.	CHITCHAT
Get a nicer experience painting experience.	CHITCHAT
Through those kind of things I just realized I was painting on the layer there and I think it might be better to keep this.	O
Little pathway separate until we are sure of everything with the perspective so.	O
We'll just do it this way.	O
La path going the distance.	O
We've got on its own layer for now.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Trying to find the right green for these.	O
Bush is in the distance, we're almost there.	O
Maybe a little bit darker.	O

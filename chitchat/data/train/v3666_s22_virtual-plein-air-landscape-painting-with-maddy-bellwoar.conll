There's also shadows.	O
So I like the unevenness of these Bush is they do form kinds of a ridgeback there, but it's not it's not perfectly.	O
It's not a perfect stripe, you know, there's a little bit of.	O
Undulation to it.	O
So right now, I'm painting kind of the darker area on these.	O
This foliage back here I will come back in with another.	O
Layer and add some highlights I think, to give it a little bit more dimension.	O
So what would it look like if you would turn up the spacing same result of evenly spaced rates of color.	O
We actually I did that yesterday in a painting.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I had turned the brush.	O
Yeah, the spacing on the brush further apart and it just creates this kind of.	O
Thing so depending on what you're painting, I was painting, a girl with a braid and from a distance.	O
It kind of gave that.	O
Rough appearance and was yeah, it was cool, but it depends.	O
It's a very specific kind of thing that might not work in a lot of situations.	O
But it's fun to mess with that stuff, changing the spacing on the brush can turn the brush into a completely different brush.	O
But that's true is like so many other brush settings, you know.	O
You just change a couple little things and bam just a completely new brush.	O
So this is actually kind of cool, Rafi I'm glad you said that.	CHITCHAT
It can make it more wispy looking too.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Back to the regular settings.	O
And there's a big.	O
Bush over here.	O
That kind of almost hangs out over the.	O
The pathway.	O
And so I just want to get the overall round shape of it.	O
Blocked in Where the shadows are roughly?	O
And then	O
There's a tree right next to it.	O
Every she needs a friend right.	CHITCHAT
These 2 are great together.	O
I love the variety like the loop that all thinner tree.	O
Short stouter tree.	O
Both pretty rounded shapes so overall pretty cheerful feeling.	O
Yeah, maybe we'll try our little trick here with making a selection of the overall shape of the tree.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Lightly, dabbing, a textured brush can also erase into the shape and try a different brush.	O
It's just such a fun way to begin a tree.	O
Painting.	O
Can have the?	CHITCHAT
Branches curving inward towards the.	O
Tree trunk.	O
Yeah, my color wheel is Coulouris.	O
It's yeah, it's a separate plugin that that I have.	O
I originally got it because an older version of photo shop didn't have the colour true triangle color wheel, which I.	O
Really prefer now you can actually go to window color.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
You can use this color wheel if you have CC 2019 or later, so.	O
Otherwise, you would have this Hue Q, which a lot of people like but I just prefer the triangle.	O
So that's why I got Coulouris.	O
It does have some other features that are called to it has like gamut, masking and stuff, but I just don't.	O
Use it normally.	O
But yeah, it some.	CHITCHAT
Nice looking I like how it looks so I still use.	O
It even though it's technically not.	O

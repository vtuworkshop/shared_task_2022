Not needed anymore.	O
So I'm trying to use a textured eraser and erase back in towards the tree shape to break up that perfect.	O
Edge that we created.	O
With the lasso tool.	O
Maybe this one.	CHITCHAT
Would be a good choice?	CHITCHAT
That's the only problem.	O
It's cool that it creates such an intense shape.	O
But yeah, if you don't want that then.	O
You have to erase back into it and.	O
Make it look a little bit more natural.	O
But it's nice 'cause it does keep you like remotely with the clean shape as like the structure of it.	O
My starting point.	O
I'm going to flip this and flip my reference and take a look.	O
I think this tree.	O
It still turn a little bit.	O
I like the feeling that it's kind of angled inward at least at least not angled outward would be a preference.	O
And before I merge I want to.	O
Get these in the perfect spot.	O
Not quite ready to merge yet.	O
And these 2 are very close together almost.	O
Overlapping also I'm making the trees little bit bigger in my painting than they are in the reference that's OK, I think.	O
Just want to zoom in on them basically make it a little bit more interesting.	O
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Make them more of her.	O
Featured in our in our painting.	O
Does not feel a little bit windy?	O
In the at least in the reference.	O
I'm hoping I can capture that in my version by the end.	O
But in the reference it looks nice and windy.	O
It would be nice to get that feeling.	O
I'm going to make this.	O
He'll go up a little bit higher.	O
Pier.	O
Yeah, I'm running out of room for this little Bush here.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Right.	CHITCHAT
So back to foreground.	O
Hi below welcome.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for joining me if you have any questions, you can.	CHITCHAT
Let me know if you want to paint.	CHITCHAT
Along you can take the reference from below the stream description or.	CHITCHAT
Under the info panel.	CHITCHAT
Above the chat.	CHITCHAT
OK, so now with all of stuff I've painted the pathway looks pretty out of place, so I'm just going to make a new one.	O
I think we can do better.	O
So I will still use the selection tool for it.	O
I love using selection tool to make nice clean shapes and.	O
Things like this so we'll use that and then.	O
There's a little turn at the end, where overlaps.	O
You're getting a little bit of like.	O
We see over the Hill.	O
That's a tough thing to capture I think I need to add a little bit more of the Hill.	O
Over here.	O
To make that work?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think that makes more sense.	O
OK.	O
Get rid of the other one and then let's give a little texture to this.	O
Path.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Even if we're just using color dynamics to put something in there, so it's not flat Gray that's fine.	O
There's a little bit of a shadow I think.	O
From Bush that I maybe have an added in yet.	O
Little bit of a shadow over here.	O
Yeah, so let's add them in that little Bush.	O
He seems so comfortable with this type of styling.	O
Well, thanks, I think I've been doing.	CHITCHAT

This type of stuff in my virtual Plein Air paintings for awhile now and I'm.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I'm just trying to embrace it.	CHITCHAT
A little bit more like just letting myself go really loose with it.	CHITCHAT
I think I've been I don't know subconsciously.	CHITCHAT
Or consciously still trying to hang hang on to a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Realism whatever that means with the.	CHITCHAT
With my painting an I'm trying to let myself just have more fun with it and not worry about if.	CHITCHAT
If you zoom in.	CHITCHAT
And it looks chaotic that's OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to just be OK with that an.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if you guys ever feel this way, but sometimes the art that you like.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
The art that you make can be.	CHITCHAT
Different and that's also OK 'cause for example, I like a lot of different types of art styles and I don't paint in all those styles.	CHITCHAT
But I started to notice with these with a landscape painting and things that a lot of the art that I really, really loved.	CHITCHAT
With all these textures, and everything I just notice the pattern, a lot of these artists were like really brave in their mark making and.	CHITCHAT
It didn't seem so worried about realistic.	CHITCHAT
Things as much as they were focused on moods.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to embrace that in my own art and just let myself be a little bit more free with.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
But the textures and things like that.	CHITCHAT
No hands you that's funny that you.	CHITCHAT
Guest that somehow but yeah, me and Mills have known each other for a long time.	CHITCHAT
Very long time now.	CHITCHAT
It looks like a River that's funny.	O
We were saying that about the last one to the painting I did right before this.	CHITCHAT
Had.	CHITCHAT
Pathway also that kind of like a River to the bus at the beginning.	CHITCHAT
Will have to paint the paint will have to make a painting with a real River in it soon.	CHITCHAT
But this one is a pathway.	O
And I think I will desaturate it a little bit, it's a dirt road it does reflect a little bit of the Sky.	O
The color in the Sky, but Yeah, it's pretty desaturated.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the next comments.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
It will keep going, adding these little Bush is and things until at least I feel like there is enough.	O
We can go back in and.	O
Do a little bit more detail and improve them.	O
I'm going to flip the reference and flip my canvas.	O
I like to flip horizontally.	O
A lot because it helps me notice mistakes and things.	O
Proportions it just tricks you into tricks your brain into having a fresh look at the painting it kind of.	O
You kind of reprocess the image in your brain a little bit and sometimes just notice things you didn't notice.	O
So I want to have a little bit more of a subtle transition between the pathway in the dirt.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I think I will take a	O
Darker color for shadow.	O
Here at the end and kind of blend that because there is a little bit more of A.	O
Subtle transition.	O
How long have you been doing streams full time now?	CHITCHAT
I've been streaming about 2 1/2 years and?	CHITCHAT
Basically, I was full time streaming almost that whole time at the beginning of the time that I was.	CHITCHAT
That I was streaming I was also doing other work as well.	CHITCHAT
But I kind of jumped in and started streaming a lot of hours from the time that I began streaming.	CHITCHAT
Before that I was.	CHITCHAT

Basically still doing the painting at home.	CHITCHAT
I'm still working working from home doing painting for.	CHITCHAT
Significant portion of the day.	CHITCHAT
Anne I decided it would be nice to you.	CHITCHAT
Hang out with some other people, while doing that and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm very I'm very passionate about.	CHITCHAT
Learning and sharing techniques.	CHITCHAT
With art and painting and.	CHITCHAT
So I decided to share my journey of.	CHITCHAT
Studying learning and teaching what I.	CHITCHAT
Discover along the way.	CHITCHAT
But it's crazy, I think that it's been that long.	CHITCHAT
Everything like these little.	CHITCHAT
They're not really path, but Little openings in between.	O
The Tufts of grass isn't things.	O
Not sure how to illustrate that.	O
There's all these little.	O
Little Tufts and they kind of form like groups and paths and stuff like they're not evenly spaced.	O
That's a beautiful thing about nature.	O
It's not like.	CHITCHAT
They are evenly spaced like this and you kind of want to avoid that your painting that's something that I do sometimes it's like accidentally.	O
Make things even everything even and kind of like the same size and I tried to work against that.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
And make a little bit more variety in the size of things that distance between them.	O
Stuff like that for more natural look.	O
Oh, cool, you should do it hanji.	CHITCHAT
Had that's that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Just tuned in what are you using to paint hyfab I am painting in Photoshop, I'm using CC 2019 right here.	O
And if you have any.	CHITCHAT
Give me other questions welcome to let me know.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's some purple shadows.	O
All these little.	O
Little Tufts.	O
Not sure exactly like what the plans are but.	O
They have kind of A.	O
Purple color to them at least in this lighting now.	O
This whole lighting scenario is probably affecting that.	O
Oh, the tablet I have a Wakeham Centriq 22.	CHITCHAT
So it is a screen.	CHITCHAT
It is a screen tablet and I'm using the stylus to paint.	CHITCHAT
I know you can't see it in the?	CHITCHAT
In the video, but Yeah, I'm really happy with this tablet also.	CHITCHAT
I got it kind of recently in October.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I really love it.	CHITCHAT
I think it could be Heather, Oh that makes sense that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, probably is Heather.	CHITCHAT
Hi AC how are you?	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah, she probably look at the time.	CHITCHAT
So I think we've been painting this for around 40 minutes, something like that.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That's not too bad.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I will probably keep going for.	CHITCHAT
For awhile longer I was aiming for between an hour and a half hour and a half for this one.	CHITCHAT
We'll see how long it takes to bring things together.	CHITCHAT
I've been keeping things on separate layers a little bit more than I did for the first painting today because.	O
I'd like to do some more work in the Sky.	O
So let's actually work on the Sky a little bit more now kind of feeling.	O
Inspired over here, there's some.	O
Some textures, some interesting textures.	O
In the clouds even if you look at the actual actual reference.	O
You think of clouds as being soft, but	O
You get a lot of these little wispy textures, and stuff that I think yeah, it can be really interesting.	O
Want to get a tablet.	CHITCHAT
I tried a few but still unsure yeah, it's a big decision so big decision.	CHITCHAT
For me, I watched so many videos and things before getting a tablet an I think yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think it's OK to take your time you know.	CHITCHAT
It's a big decision.	CHITCHAT
I'm doing good.	CHITCHAT

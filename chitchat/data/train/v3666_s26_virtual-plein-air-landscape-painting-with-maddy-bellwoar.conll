Thank you enjoying the paintings.	CHITCHAT
Today I've been trying to do some texture experiments and things and just.	O
Be a little bit looser with the.	O
Detailed wizan work on texture.	O
So that's been the goal.	O
Today I've enjoyed enjoying the painting, relaxing environment painting is always relaxing to me.	CHITCHAT
And less OK, there's an exception and less, I'm painting environments with a lot of perspective if there's a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Perspective it's not necessarily relaxing.	CHITCHAT
I still like it.	CHITCHAT
More relaxing with fully natural type of scene, I think.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Bob Joe he'd isadora thanks everybody welcome.	CHITCHAT
If you guys want to see the reference that I'm using you can look below the stream in the info.	CHITCHAT
Are below the streaming description or in the info panel and the reference will be there?	CHITCHAT
And you're welcome to paint with me if you like the reference.	CHITCHAT
And you want to do a little study as well.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to paint and share what you do in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Anytime the time.	CHITCHAT
Doing studies on stream I like to share my reference and.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to join in I think it's more fun.	CHITCHAT
I think it's more fun to study.	CHITCHAT
As a group plus it's nice to see how people different people different styles approach the same kind of setting.	CHITCHAT
I definitely learned a lot from seeing.	CHITCHAT
Doing a painting and then seeing how someone else has.	CHITCHAT
You know decided to solve certain certain problems and things and seen.	CHITCHAT
Give you a new way of looking at things.	CHITCHAT
Hi Ramco High Mattie want to use the color Picker on the reference.	CHITCHAT
So I don't use the color.	O
Picker just because I'm trying to practice being able to.	O
That being able to look at a color and select it myself, I want to improve my understanding of color theory.	O
In general and Yeah, I just want to be able to paint without relying on having to have a photo reference.	O
Uhm this is just a personal this is something that I've decided personally but I don't think that it's.	O
Necessarily requirement lots of artists have different workflows and some people you know color pic from photos and that's part of their.	O
Workflow and I think that's fine, but I feel that I've.	O
Gotten a lot faster with my painting since getting away from color picking from the references so that's been a nice benefit from it.	O
Does the color picker knowledge the reference uhm not really?	O
I think you have to what you can do is?	CHITCHAT
If you hold alt bring up the color picker if you hold all outside of.	O
Pure ref and then.	O
Glide over onto it, it will I think pick colors?	O
But if you try to just hover over this and hold alt it won't bring up the color Picker.	O
So that's kind of a way you can do that, but Hum that's just answer your question Kate and hello.	CHITCHAT
Where do you put the canvas?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I do flip the canvas often it's like a habit the reason I do it is because.	O
It helps give me a fresh look at the painting so.	O
I flip my reference to on my other monitor.	O
I have the reference next to the chat like in a full.	O
Size an I flip both of them and it just helps me notice if something is wrong, you know it forces your brain to like really.	O
Process what you're looking at and it's with landscapes.	O
I mean, I find it still helpful it's most.	O
A parent or it makes more of a dramatic help when you're painting portraits or something like that.	O
If you flip it if you flip the portrait you'll notice all of a sudden that.	O
Maybe one of the eyes is like too low or something your brain will just suddenly see it.	O
It's just little trick to get a fresh look at the painting.	O
Sometimes I flipped because it's easier to make a brush stroke from One Direction or the other depending on if you're right or left handed.	O
It might be easier for you to make a brush stroke from a certain direction.	O
That's another reason to flip but usually I'm doing it just to.	O
Just to see how it looks if you can have your painting working from both directions.	O
Then things are probably.	CHITCHAT
Then you got it probably things are probably working pretty well.	O
All thank you Isadora.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I think the way the smooth texture in some areas of these clouds might be might be my chance.	O
To use the mixer brush I don't know.	O
I really love the mixer brush, but I get confused sometimes using it.	O

The only downside is I would have to merge.	O
Stuff.	O
Well, you don't have to but.	O
Yeah, I think I think I would like to wait a little bit longer, maybe after I emerged.	O
I'll do it.	O
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Marty.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I will wait on the mixer brush, but I might use at the end after I merge stuff will see.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK so I want to go back to the pathway in the foreground and all that stuff, I try to move around the painting.	O
So that I don't let anyone area start to get completely finished while other areas are really falling behind.	O
It's	CHITCHAT
Specially, when you're doing a quick time study.	CHITCHAT
You don't want to get sucked into too many details in one area.	CHITCHAT
I'm just saying this from experience.	CHITCHAT
'cause that's how I used to run out of time on time studies.	CHITCHAT
It's like getting to suck then and next thing you know you're out of time and you painted.	CHITCHAT
One area like Super Nice.	CHITCHAT
And then everything else is not done so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I tried to.	CHITCHAT
Try to keep that in mind, and move around the canvas and also it helps give you a good picture of how things are working relative to each other you know.	CHITCHAT
You can kind of build the painting up together.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I think it might be time for me to merge things finally.	O
I'm being a little timid about it.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I want to put a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Let's put a little bit more texture into this.	O
Tree.	O
Little little less saturated and more towards blue.	O
There's like a blue Gray color to the groups of leaves here.	O
Oh, nice.	CHITCHAT
I really like the color palette in this whole area.	O
This whole scene and I like seeing things like this in person too.	CHITCHAT
Going for walks in areas that look like this.	CHITCHAT
I don't know at all, what the temperature might be in this place.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Seems.	CHITCHAT
Seems perfect.	CHITCHAT
It seems like it would be.	CHITCHAT
A little Breezy.	CHITCHAT
And cool but not cold.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to compromise on the merging the whole thing with emerging I'm going to merge everything.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
On 2 one layer except the Sky.	O
I'm going to merge the Sky down onto underpainting so we have this and then this.	O
This layer and this layer.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the nice comments.	CHITCHAT
Jackson says I'm going to call my version done send it directly in the trash bin tried going full opacity brush like what I did with the line tool, he'd mistake.	CHITCHAT
Without law, so the shapes are garbage.	CHITCHAT
It's so hard.	CHITCHAT
It's so hard to make super strong shapes without the lasso tool.	O
Like I find brushes that are like squares or triangles, or something like that can help but it's tough.	O
I really like this brush because of that.	O
Well, Hey.	CHITCHAT
You know how it is.	CHITCHAT
Still, worth still worth the study even if you don't like the result.	CHITCHAT
We still learn even if we're just learning something we don't want to do next time still counts.	CHITCHAT
Still, counts.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm going to try the mixer brush.	O
I'm going to duplicate my background layer in case I don't like.	O
What I do?	CHITCHAT
Um so we have the mixer brush here.	O
I'm kind of new to the mixer brush so.	CHITCHAT
It's a little experimental but basically this these settings.	O
I was messing with the other well the last time I.	O
Used it and I like this, this kind of wet paint smear or smudge kind of effect that it gets.	O
It looks very.	O
Like oil painting kind of feeling which I think is awesome.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Mostly, where I see this is let me show the reference really quick up close, you can see.	O
This area right here in the reference doesn't, it look like a paint stroke.	O

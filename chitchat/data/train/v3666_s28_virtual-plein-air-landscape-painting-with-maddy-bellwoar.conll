That's what it looks like to me, it looks like a?	CHITCHAT
It looks already like a paint stroke, which is awesome.	O
It gives us a good idea of what we can do.	O
So this has been really the extent of my personal use of the mixture brushes like I don't really paint with it, but sometimes.	O
After I've already painted I like to come in on Top of that and add some individual brush strokes.	O
2.	CHITCHAT
You know the kind of like accents and give a little.	O
A little extra.	O
Will texture stuff like that?	O
So if I turn this layer on and off you can see the changes and.	O
I don't know I don't know if it's better or not, but.	CHITCHAT
Something fun to play with.	CHITCHAT
Any more practice with it.	CHITCHAT
Really but Let's let's flip let's try from this direction.	O
One thing that's nice is these smoother textures in the background.	O
Make the textures of the tree and everything like that, really stand out as being.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Get more sharp and noisy.	O
Then the smooth Sky and that makes the Sky look.	O
Extra.	O
Soft.	O
Yeah, it's really changing.	O
Changing a lot, but I think I like it.	CHITCHAT
So one thing that you can do is I like to do this alot is erased out.	O
So if I do something I'll kind of look and see well what do I like about what I did?	CHITCHAT
Was there something I liked more about the original?	CHITCHAT
I did like this angle?	O
Here, like that.	O
One curve's going to bring that back in.	O
And other than that I kind of like I like some of the changes so I'll just let it be.	O
Except for erasing through that one area.	O
I'm going to make a new layer and choose yeah, we'll just stay on normal mode, but I want to.	O
Grab the airbrush.	O
And give a little bit of glow.	O
Around the opening of the.	O
For clouds to the Sky behind there.	O
Just need to brighten things up a little bit.	O
Will you shift that until it feels right?	O
Yeah something a little cooler maybe?	O
OK.	O
Well, if anybody else is painting along I hope it's going well.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're enjoying the painting.	CHITCHAT
You can also use the smudge brush to get some type of similar effects that the mixer brush can get as far as.	O
Traditional painting kind of feeling I think that I think is much brush is really nice for some soft blending and.	O
Things that feel like smudged wet paint and stuff like that softening areas getting some edges to be lost.	O
Sometimes it's nice to smudge things a little bit as they get into the distance.	O
You know it really helps give that feeling of.	O
Heping further away and in this situation, it almost makes it look like it's raining back there, it's kind of cool.	O
I like you.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
I think a new layer and.	O
I think it's time for me to try to start putting finishing things in this finishing textures and.	O
Things that I want to pull this together and.	O
And call this study done.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I think this tree is one area that can use the little extra love.	O
I want to add a little bit of more individual.	O
Maybe not individual leaves.	O
But you know smaller groups of leads to make it look a little bit more detailed.	O
And I can either I can also either erase out or just paint over color picking from the Sky.	O
And paint little areas back in so for example.	O
You know, so that we can see the tree trunk a little bit more again.	O
We can kind of paint in around there.	O
Graphics is it does look like a windy day.	O
I think it's from the Sky and what you're doing with the brush strokes makes it feel that way.	O

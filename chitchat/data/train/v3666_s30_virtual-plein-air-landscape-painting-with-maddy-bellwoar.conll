I want a little bit of a shadow coming across the path from this little.	O
Little Bush here.	O
Hey red welcome.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha ha.	CHITCHAT
I'm having a little bit of trouble with all the chaos that's happening over here.	O
It's some in the actual painting, I mean, sorry an actual reference not my painting, I find it really beautiful.	O
How these little like windy paths of Heather kind of?	O
Coming down and I don't I think mine as I was talking about earlier there a little too evenly spaced.	O
And I want them to kind of formal trails so I'm going to try to fix that now.	O
James says these overcast paintings are really valuable for concept stuff being able to control streaks of light really gives you the ability to control the read of the subject silhouette.	CHITCHAT
Ooh that's really interesting.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like I was mentioning earlier.	CHITCHAT
I really like these kind of moods.	CHITCHAT
But I find it.	CHITCHAT
I find it hard to well, sometimes it's hard to paint over cast stuff because there's not I don't know I just think without the.	CHITCHAT
Dramatic dappled lighting kind of look the pops of light sometimes it can be.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it can be hard to get a strong of a mood for me, but I really like I really like these kind of scenes.	CHITCHAT
I like the mood of them.	CHITCHAT
And I'd like to get better at painting them and also it's hard for me to find great references of cloudy days.	CHITCHAT
I think there must be hard to photograph.	CHITCHAT
So when I saw this one, I was really excited.	CHITCHAT
This was one from Google Street View map crunch.	CHITCHAT
And I thought it was really nice image.	CHITCHAT
Um so do discord mixer brush just a blender, but lends leaving a canvas texture.	O
It's pretty cool Oh.	CHITCHAT
So much.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for sharing that with me.	CHITCHAT
I'm excited to try it.	O
Police has a lot of muted colors and overcast conditions.	O
Yeah, that's true that's true.	CHITCHAT
But this painting is making me want to do a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Moody stuff, which I guess is good.	CHITCHAT
Being that it's it's autumn.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I can take some photos.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you for the tip.	CHITCHAT
Good bunch of solid overcast shots in those free no Bradley packs on gumroad the ones from schottland, especially.	O
OK, I have those packs downloaded I will check in there for that.	O

Lots of different landscapes and things so if you want to do some studies of those it's really good.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Nice quality images to paint from.	O
Going to do a little like sketching and cross hatching here, sometimes that's fun to do.	O
As well along with the.	O
Painting 'cause it can give a different texture.	O
Still, a little bit, yeah, I'm still trying to keep things bit stylized.	O
And there's a bunch of little pebbles and textures of.	O
Random dried.	O
Plants.	O
And stuff like that so.	O

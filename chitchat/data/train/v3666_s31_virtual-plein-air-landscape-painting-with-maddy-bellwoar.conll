So I'll merge that down so we still have basically the Sky and everything else.	O
So I want to paint some a little bit more bright NIS behind the trees and everything in the Sky.	O
Oops well, I don't mean to zoom in sorry.	O
Um a little bit more brightness back here in the reference.	O
It's the contrast is pretty intense.	O
There.	O
In a couple of places.	O
So I'd like to brighten it up.	O
There's a couple of slivers in the Sky that are really, really bright and it's.	O
Very pretty.	O
Oh, cool that's awesome James.	CHITCHAT
She also streams here.	CHITCHAT
In case you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, in case he didn't follow her here yet.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you're welcome, I hope you enjoy the brushes.	CHITCHAT
So I'm running into something right now where just to kind of like assess the progress of this.	CHITCHAT
I like how.	CHITCHAT
I like how about Top of the.	O
The Top portion of the composition is working in regard to the texture.	O
For example, there's some areas with the colour dynamics on and then there's some.	O
Areas without it where the your eyes can kind of rest a little bit.	O
I think as much as I love color dynamics brushes.	O
I think I'm running into a thing in the foreground where it's just too busy.	O
Over here on the left on the right.	O
I think it's working again.	O
There's some area where there's a little bit more rest your eyes can rest a little bit.	O
Over here it's like.	O
Too busy in my opinion, so I'm going to try to.	O
Maybe add some clean shapes so for example, I really like in the reference this one.	O
Area.	O
Where we get we were looking through the foliage.	O
We see through to the dirt and it's just dusty it has a light texture, but it's small.	O
Text I like you know, small little pebbles, so from a distance.	O
There's really just.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
Not very textured so.	O
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I hope you I hope you enjoy them.	CHITCHAT

We're doing every 2 weeks or studying a different subject matter and we're starting portraits right now an I put a bunch of.	CHITCHAT
Reference images in there and anyone is welcome to join in with the studies and share their art in the discord.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT

Able to use for study and things like that with your art.	O
So you don't have to worry about that, if you if anybody wants to do.	CHITCHAT
Can grab those references in paint paint along?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, well that really didn't tone down the?	O
The business this is kind of added to it, OK will try something else.	O
Let's get a brush that is.	O
Pretty smooth, maybe I'll try that or I don't hate the idea of having texture.	O
But I just need something a little bit more clean than what is there?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Just going to stay zoomed out so I can really see how this looks at a distance, but And then we have some dirt overlapping the The path here.	O

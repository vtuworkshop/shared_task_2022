Let's flip I think that's better.	O
Kind of hard to say.	O
Let's keep going.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a little better.	O
Will try to establish some shapes of individual little little plants or Bush is here and that might help, too.	O
Not have it be so chaotic if we can see somewhere.	O
Where one plant ends and then behind it is just dirt area something like that.	O
Look up a little.	O
Little Tufts.	O
So Cute, Happy little plants.	CHITCHAT
And then in the foreground they get really big.	O
So we're pretty close to these ones that are.	O
Right near us here on the left we flip again get fresh look.	O
So this kind of getting towards the end here.	O
I can make sense of this stuff, then I feel like it'll be it'll be ready to be finished.	O
So I'm going to grab a different brush.	O
And paint some of these little.	O
Grass is that I think part of what makes this scene look nice and windy is there's a bunch of.	O
These little grass is that are kind of bending and swaying over.	O
And they do have a little bit of a gradient to them, so we're going to add that in.	O
But I'm going to start with just a paying attention only to the shape.	O
Oh, James those schools in winter sales soon, maybe within a week.	CHITCHAT
If you're looking to take some more courses.	CHITCHAT
Good to know good to know Oh my gosh, it's.	CHITCHAT
So this time of year.	CHITCHAT
Crazy.	CHITCHAT
Crazy.	CHITCHAT
Hi Marty welcome.	CHITCHAT
Right so I sketched in a bunch of these on the other side, there's also one pretty close up here.	O
I think that adds a lot of windy windiness.	O
Couple little puffs here and there and then I have a brush that I like to use for a grassy type textures.	O
It's a brush that looks a lot like paint stroke, which I like.	O
Little more traditional kind of feeling.	O
I sing welcome back.	CHITCHAT
So this way.	CHITCHAT
We can kind of paint over those little areas with some extra texture, which I think is nice.	O
Although I hope I'm not asking too much.	O
It's going to make it hard to understand what's going on here again.	O
OK, so I'm going to lock that layer and grab the Airbrush.	O
And for each of these groups of grass is down near the base.	O
I'm just going to give it a little bit of.	O
Shading like this and it is just something it doesn't take long at all.	O
Just really quickly.	O
And then you can also do the opposite and.	O
No.	O
Bring things up at the Top.	O
Henderson yeah, we have some happy little trees here.	CHITCHAT
Alright I think that's OK, I will take the same brush.	O

And the only thing I don't like is for example, you see down here.	O
This little grasp coming out of nowhere.	O
I kind of like a better transition.	O
You know, maybe put some little texture on the ground or something there.	O
I don't know what the answer is but.	CHITCHAT
There needs to be something.	CHITCHAT
For me.	CHITCHAT
Alright, it's almost done.	O
One thing I notice on this this.	CHITCHAT
Pathway this road here is that there's a little bit of lighter.	O
Highlights around the edges, I don't know.	O
It has something to do with where the areas.	O
Are worn out where the vehicles drive and stuff like that?	O
But.	CHITCHAT
I think it's going to cool.	CHITCHAT
Like that in.	CHITCHAT
Alright.	CHITCHAT
Well, this one turned out a little bit busier than maybe I would have liked in some places.	O
But overall, I think I think I like it.	O
Going to add a couple little random.	O
There's little random stones.	O
An rocks and things and I think it would be nice to maybe add a couple of them just because it brings.	O
A little bit of that, Gray Blue into the rest of the environment here.	O
Yeah, I think I think it's done.	O
All right.	O
Think it's done for now.	CHITCHAT

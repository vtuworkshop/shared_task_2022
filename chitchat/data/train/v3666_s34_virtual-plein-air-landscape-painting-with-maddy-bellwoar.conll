I kind of focused in on this area.	O
But yeah, you could make a painting of like multiple different angles of this.	O
I kind of want to focus in on one area so that it doesn't get too.	O
Overwhelming with the sheer amount of detail and things to include so I think.	O
Yeah, well will zoom in a little bit, but if you want you can.	O
Explore that.	O
The Pond, the water all thank you Marty.	CHITCHAT
Too late to be contrary that's OK.	CHITCHAT
I like the other one too.	CHITCHAT
I will probably will probably save the other one for a future painting.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
My digital pen, I'm using a Wakeham Centriq 22.	O
That is my my tablet.	O
Alright so let's get set up for one more painting.	O
And I'm going to put the painting on my other monitor next to the chat in a larger size.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Oh, the info panel has the wrong name.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I wonder what happened wonder what I did.	CHITCHAT
They both have the same.	CHITCHAT
URL.	CHITCHAT
Let me try this again.	CHITCHAT
That was weird.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Alright hope that works now.	CHITCHAT
Alright so new canvas, I will put my.	O
Reference here and let's see how big my canvases.	O
We will make this a little bigger, maybe like 2500 pixels wide something like that.	O
I will keep it in the same aspect ratio as the reference.	O
It's updated now OK thank you.	CHITCHAT
Mills thanks for letting me know.	CHITCHAT
So the only thing that I think is a little.	CHITCHAT
Tough about this.	CHITCHAT
One thing that's a little bit tough about this.	O
Reference is the.	O
The composition I think.	O
I think overall it's	O
It's OK, but The fact that there's if I'm just going to sketch it out really quick.	O
The fact that there's this kind of thing happening where?	O
I feel like we're almost closed of- a little bit by the way that the land is coming from the side here.	O
Do you know what I mean, so I'm thinking?	CHITCHAT
Maybe we can change the composition a little bit and either have?	O
The water just go all the way across or maybe we can have a little opening where it's like a River that comes closer to us.	O
I think I might change the composition a little bit.	O
I don't know I don't know if it's too ambitious.	CHITCHAT
But I think we can maybe make it a little bit more like drawing the viewer in.	O
To the the composition a little bit or maybe adding a Bush in the foreground, something feels not perfect to me about the composition.	O
But I do like the setting so.	O
We'll see what we can do with it.	CHITCHAT
Hi using more welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's get started and the time for me is around 3:30 so.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do the same thing and we're going to do about maybe between an hour, an hour and a half on this painting just depending on how it goes and.	CHITCHAT
See see how much time we need.	CHITCHAT
Did I say this?	CHITCHAT
Save the file before we start this is the references in Estonia.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
All thanks thanks Kate.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I think I will keep going with the workflow from today, so I've been doing an underpainting for these.	CHITCHAT
And I've been using my rectangle brush with color dynamics on.	O
And just the beginning with a warmer like medium tone background that I know it looks crazy at this.	O
There's size on this stage but.	O
So starting with something like that, and then.	O
Just a roughly.	CHITCHAT
Roughly indicating the The values as well so.	O

We're going to have a little bit of a break in the clouds here.	O
Or will see to the blue Sky, the Sky is mostly white, mostly white clouds, mostly Gray you know pretty bright.	O
And then	O
We've got Lake here with some reflective.	O
Qualities, which really pretty maybe will have it maybe I'll just make the Lake bigger or something.	O
And then Some pushes The row of bushes behind there.	O
And then the trees.	O
I really like this, I really like this tree.	CHITCHAT
I really like the way that you can kind of feel the weight of the branches.	O
And I've got a group of looks like a couple trees here in the middle.	O
Then couple more over on the side here.	O
The only problem is, I'm running into the situation that I have a lot, where it's like I don't really want everything to be.	O
Evenly spaced, I think it will look nicer if the scene doesn't have such.	O
Perfectly spaced things from each other so for example, maybe I can make this.	O
These are.	CHITCHAT
Trees.	O
Closer to this other one a little bit larger and then put a space here and then put a smaller one.	O
You know just keep it.	O
I want it to feel balanced but not symmetrical.	O
I don't think this is necessarily feels balanced but.	O
To start will figure it out.	O
Yeah, that's interesting to hear Mills.	CHITCHAT
I do think it's kind of a similar idea in the sense that I'm not using like a ton of different values just kind of breaking it down too.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, simpler more simplified version of the.	O
Of the composition is that's what I'm trying for C Oh, thank you welcome.	O
OK, I think.	CHITCHAT
OK, like this.	CHITCHAT
Let's get started and I'll try to keep my underpainting layer in case I need to refer back to this 'cause I do think that at this point.	O
It's a good expression of what I want.	O
For this painting.	O
I make sure this is saving OK.	O
So let's start with the background again as far as the Sky will work back to front and I've been enjoying this.	O
Wispy light texture brush and.	O
Let's start with like a medium blue Gray color for the clouds.	O
Maybe maybe I'll start with darker color and then we'll add highlights.	O
I'm not sure this so usually what will look at is.	CHITCHAT
What is the most dominant color?	O
Is it's the clouds mostly bright are they mostly in shadow it's like on the left.	O
There's a lot of shadow on the right images Little Overexposed Maybe.	O
And it's pretty bright usually whatever is the most dominant thing I'll start with that and then add the other thing as an accent whether it's shadows or highlights and it's kind of hard to tell on this one.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to keep it really loose.	O
And try to focus on the overall feeling of the lighting more than anything else.	O
So it's pretty great back here.	O
Yeah, that's one weakness of this reference is that some of the Sky is kind of overexposed so it's not.	O
That parts model, not too easy to work with, but overall, especially because I've painted a good amount of.	O
Landscapes at this point, so I'm hoping that I can kind of fill in a little bit.	O
From my knowledge from previous paintings.	O
And I want to paint in that little.	O
Patch of blue in the Sky.	O
Oh, that's really bright OK, not that not that much.	O
See sometimes in, not color picking from the reference.	O

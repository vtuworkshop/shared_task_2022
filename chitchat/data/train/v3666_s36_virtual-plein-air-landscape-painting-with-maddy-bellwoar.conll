It takes me.	O
Awhile to find the right color.	O
Sometimes they get in the first try and sometimes I have to.	O
Kind of fish around for it, but Overall, I'm getting faster at selecting the right color.	O
By trying to practice.	O
My color picking getting better.	O
It was really great area over here.	O
And down here there's a few kind of similar scenarios, the last painting.	O
A little little slivers of light shining through the clouds here.	O
And there's a little bit of like a warm purple think I'm just starting to see that.	O
I mean, it's very, very light.	O
But the clouds have some kind of warmth in them.	O
It's not all cold is not all of these saturated.	O
Do you draw fantasy animals?	CHITCHAT
Not so much I I do environments and then I also at least in the past if you look at My Portfolio.	CHITCHAT
I've drawn a lot of characters and.	CHITCHAT
Things like that I've done fantasy characters like elves and fairies and all that kind of stuff but.	CHITCHAT
I haven't done a lot of creature design.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't interest me as much as other things, but You never know you never know I used to not be very interested in landscape painting and then now.	CHITCHAT
Look at me, it's like my favorite thing to do so.	CHITCHAT
You never know what's going to happen.	CHITCHAT
With your art.	CHITCHAT
Let me this has been the hardest one for me to start so far.	O
Let's Look in black-and-white sometimes that helps.	O
If anybody is painting along with me, I hope it's hope it's going well.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having an easier time.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So we have some crazy stuff mapped in for the Sky right now.	O
I'm going to leave it as it is I don't really.	O
I don't really like it, but I think I'm having trouble visualizing the Sky without having any contrast of.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Without having any contrast of the other parts of the image.	O
Let me try your first landscape.	O
There was actually a few things that happened sort of simultaneously to cause me to get into landscape painting.	CHITCHAT
One of the things was me and my boyfriend were actually doing some streams together, we were doing some dual streams together.	CHITCHAT
Where we were?	CHITCHAT
Taking random requests and suggestions on what to paint an we painted a few scenes with animals and some.	CHITCHAT
Landscapes and things like that, and that was one of my first forays into like timed paintings where you.	CHITCHAT
Get some kind of a prompt an just kind of do your best.	CHITCHAT
But I wasn't taking them super seriously.	CHITCHAT
It was kind of for fun.	CHITCHAT
But then I had a giveaway where I basically gave away a Commission.	CHITCHAT
I let someone decide what I would paint for them.	CHITCHAT
And that person wanted me to pay a landscape so that was the first landscape that I took a long time on and really like put a lot of work into and that's actually my.	CHITCHAT
Starting soon screen here.	CHITCHAT
This was like the first landscape that I.	CHITCHAT
Me to finished illustration of and put time into kind of thing before that, I just done like click.	CHITCHAT
Landscape sketching things.	CHITCHAT
So that was interesting that that's it turned into that.	CHITCHAT
That I ended up really liking, it, but ironically like I didn't.	CHITCHAT
I didn't jump right in and start like loving landscapes right after doing that.	CHITCHAT
I didn't end up getting into it more heavily until a while later.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just kind of painting over my underpainting here to get an idea.	CHITCHAT

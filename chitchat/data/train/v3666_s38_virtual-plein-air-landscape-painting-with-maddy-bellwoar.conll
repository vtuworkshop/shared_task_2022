Um.	CHITCHAT
This color can often come across looking kind of fake you know.	O
Almost seems too, vibrant to be true.	O
Sometimes these greens really exist.	O
I found that uhm.	CHITCHAT
Adding a little bit more yellow.	O
To the green can make it look a little bit more natural.	O
An earthy.	O
But I like the UM the contrast of the warm and cool greens like for example, up here.	O
On this little this little Hills Little Ridge.	O
There's more blue green at the Top.	O
And there's a few layers of it to going back into the distance.	O
Few layers of.	O
Foliage.	O
Rose of Plants.	O
I'm staying zoomed out as much as I can at this stage because it really helps me see the whole.	O
The whole scene, you know together as 1.	O
One image and I'm not get lost in little details as much.	O
I mean, I'm still capable of getting lost in details with this.	O
Range but it helps it helps.	O
I'm going to merge down and just aside from the underpainting.	O
I'm just going to paint this thing on one layer.	O
I think basically.	CHITCHAT
When I say I'm painting on one one layer.	O
I'm not really actually painting only on one layer but.	O
What I'm doing is?	CHITCHAT
Usually, making a new layer above the layer with my painting and painting on that layer for awhile and then I'll turn the layer on and off and kind of compare.	O
What I've done over the last few minutes and if I like the progress then I'll just move merge it down.	O
So it's a way of like I'm still utilizing layers.	O
In a way I'm not totale painting on one layer but.	O
I'm still getting more of a traditional look to the painting 'cause I'm painting as if it's flat and.	O
Rather than kind of.	O
Imagining you know going through this layer to adjust one thing and then go into the layer below it for another thing.	O
I like to paint this way when I'm doing studies if I'm doing a full illustration.	O
It's generally smart to keep.	O
At least some separate things so you can make changes then if you need to more easily first studies.	O
I find more freedom and.	O
Enjoyment out of?	O
Merging stuff.	O
So that's so that's it.	CHITCHAT
Basically turn this on and off so look OK.	O
Alright merge it down and make a new.	O
Layer.	O
So I kind of give myself a little bit before I commit to what I've done 'cause.	O
Sometimes I will look at it an?	CHITCHAT
Get rid of it, you guys have seen it do that before even today like there was a couple of things that I decided.	O
So it doesn't look so good I'm going to try again to paint that thing.	O
Hi Sebastian, Welcome.	CHITCHAT
I like that, we can see the tree trunks, popping out peeking out from below, some of these trees.	O
Find the right color for them.	O
But basically like this.	O
I'm going to paint them right now, just mainly concerned with the.	O
The shape that I'm creating I'm not really worrying about color or anything right now.	O
That way I can.	O
Lock the layer.	O
And then grab whatever color I want to use is like a shadow.	O
And just give a little just painting a little shadow on these.	O
Then we'll merge it down.	O
Has a key?	CHITCHAT

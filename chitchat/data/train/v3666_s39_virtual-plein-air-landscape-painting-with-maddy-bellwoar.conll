I will make a new layer and put it on maybe overlay mode.	O
That way I can kind of add to what's there without completely painting over it will use a layer blending mode.	O
And.	O
Painting some highlights for example.	O
In the clouds.	O
Areas.	O
Let's flip this.	O
Now I can see maybe some.	O
Some different things after flipping the canvas, but I didn't notice before.	O
OK, I will merge that I do like that.	O
Better.	O
And I think we can make it even brighter, although let me color pick and see how close they appear way I am.	O
It's pretty exciting pretty bright.	O
It up more.	O
I'm going too far.	O
Sometimes you have to you know instead of brightening something you have to darken something else.	O
If you want dramatic.	O
More dramatic lighting.	O
It's all relative you know.	O
So behind these.	O
Burger clouds.	O
I'm not worried about painting over the trees.	O
The trees are just roughly block then I'm going to paint on Top of any of these areas with the clouds are overlapping the trees.	O
It's not a big very big worry right now whoops there goes my painting.	CHITCHAT

So many different colors in the clouds, it's really crazy.	O
You will close at this reference there really is a lot of little things happening.	O

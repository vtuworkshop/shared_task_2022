I'll start it now.	CHITCHAT
I have the tool timeline running at the beginning of stream.	CHITCHAT
Somewhere, along the way it looks like it stopped, but I just turned it on again.	CHITCHAT
But a good portion of the stream should be able to.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Have the tools captured for it.	CHITCHAT
Oh thanks Jackson.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hi pal, high Gray welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
Uh Matthias is your tablet interactive display.	CHITCHAT
It's not a touch screen.	CHITCHAT
It's but I use the Stylus on it, so.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if that would count as interactive or what exactly but yeah, so I'm drawing on the screen.	CHITCHAT
But it's not it's not a touch screen.	CHITCHAT
So I can't just like you know.	CHITCHAT
Um click buttons with or zoom in or anything like that without using the stylus to like select things.	CHITCHAT
To make that happen.	CHITCHAT
Do you work for any favourites companies?	CHITCHAT
No, do you mean like doing doing paintings for like a game or movies or something like that.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I have nots?	CHITCHAT
I've great works congratulations greetings from Cappadocia, Turkey, I great.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for the next comment.	CHITCHAT
Do you see your traditional painting so actually I do?	CHITCHAT
I do traditional painting even now if you guys want to see?	CHITCHAT
Let me post a link really quick to my?	CHITCHAT
Traditional artwork.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I do a gouache painting an I love it, and I do think it helps.	CHITCHAT
There is my Instagram for my.	CHITCHAT
Gouache painting and let me also post my digital art account as well.	CHITCHAT
I do think it I do think it helps, but I don't think it's required I get it.	CHITCHAT
I only say that because I get a questions a lot like from people that maybe are not so interested in traditional art.	CHITCHAT
And they're more interested in digital and they asked me do I have to learn traditional first or you know.	CHITCHAT
Do I have to do that, and I really don't think you have to do anything.	CHITCHAT
I think that the fundamentals are the same for all those mediums, so you can just do what it is that you like.	CHITCHAT
But anytime you try something new.	CHITCHAT
It's going to help you, you know you're going to learn something new that you can apply.	CHITCHAT
Like for me doing traditional has given me some ideas of textures, and things that I want to use in my digital painting.	CHITCHAT
So I think it's given me like a different way to think about things.	CHITCHAT
But I think also, if I were to get into 3D modeling or something like that, it would happen equal.	CHITCHAT
Effect as far as like I would I would learn new things that I would probably would probably influence my painting.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it does, but I don't think you have to do it.	CHITCHAT
And thank you very much Roman.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for that.	CHITCHAT
E Ray you can.	CHITCHAT
What I'm using for the reference images pure ref?	CHITCHAT
I will post a link to where you can download it.	CHITCHAT
In the chat.	CHITCHAT
Heather says I started doing 3D renders and my drawings improved.	CHITCHAT
I got better idea of how the human body bends.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
It's like just so you know you get introduced to a new way of thinking about things you know, some different.	CHITCHAT
Information it just it's always going to influence you when you learn something new.	CHITCHAT
I think it's great.	CHITCHAT
But I don't think that you know you have to do anything specific.	CHITCHAT
If you want to do it, I think that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
But you know.	CHITCHAT
For anybody that wants to get into digital art.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you have to do traditional first or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
Um Sebastian you can download this brush an on with the info panels above the chat.	CHITCHAT
I didn't make this brush.	CHITCHAT
It's been shared around a lot.	CHITCHAT
I've seen this brush in a lot of brush packs.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
What I do is I like to turn on color dynamics?	CHITCHAT
When I use it not every time but?	CHITCHAT
It gives a cool effect, so sometimes when I use it, I put color dynamics on.	CHITCHAT
Hi Alan, Hi baby, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
How did you find map crunch Oh?	CHITCHAT
How did I originally find it?	CHITCHAT
I follow a lot of artists that do virtual Plein Air paintings and I can't remember who initially was the one using map crunch but.	CHITCHAT
A lot of artists that I follow use the use map crunch to find references for doing practice paintings and things.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I can't I can't remember who is originally the one that I found it through.	CHITCHAT

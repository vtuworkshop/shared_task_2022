But yeah, it's pretty popular for this kind of study.	CHITCHAT
And it's fun like I have a whole channel in my discord server where I post cool places that I find.	CHITCHAT
I'm not French or on Google Street View and I'll post the link really quick to the server and chat.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's called Virtual Plein air in the server that's also the name of this type of painting.	CHITCHAT
If you want to like research more artists that are doing this.	CHITCHAT
It's a great hashtag to follow.	CHITCHAT
It's a great hashtag to follow virtual pleinair you'll see a lot of really interesting stuff.	CHITCHAT
Inspiring.	CHITCHAT
So I'm painting in some ways that were areas.	O
Where were you know peeking through the trees seen through to the Sky behind there.	O
And now I can fix this tree a little bit so I can come back in front of it.	O
Come back in front of the clouds that would make more sense.	O
You're welcome here a?	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
My French looks like random streets, yeah, let me show you something about it really quick 'cause it might help with people are looking.	CHITCHAT
So if you if you go to map crunch common you click go.	CHITCHAT
Um you'll get random streets, mostly 'cause.	CHITCHAT
It's the Google Street View car there just driving around.	CHITCHAT
So this is actually pretty cool, but, yeah, you could go and you'll get you'll get maybe like the side of the road you never know what you're going to get but.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's something really interesting.	CHITCHAT
That.	CHITCHAT
Look at that So what you can do is click on the options and click on a specific country.	CHITCHAT
If you want to get.	CHITCHAT
View in that country.	CHITCHAT
You can also go to the map and drag and drop the little person an when you do this you're more likely to get.	CHITCHAT
Like beautiful or famous places.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know how it works, but I think that they are selecting places based on like popularity or something so you'll find some more.	CHITCHAT
It's an easier way to find like paint rible things.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, that's the way you can use that to find.	CHITCHAT
Places.	CHITCHAT
Ah thanks Michael.	CHITCHAT
Hi Mama, Your traditional works are beautiful too.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much, yeah, I'm.	CHITCHAT
I started doing gouache painting about a year ago, now and I have really, really loved it and it's been.	CHITCHAT
I think a good influence on my digital painting also.	CHITCHAT
Before that, I had done traditional work like my whole life, I started drawing traditionally.	CHITCHAT
I just never really did painting.	CHITCHAT
I went from traditional drawing to digital painting.	CHITCHAT
I think some of you probably know what I mean, I think this is probably not super unique.	CHITCHAT
Imagine other people do this too because drawing is a little bit more accessible traditionally than painting like you always just grab a pencil.	CHITCHAT
And draw.	CHITCHAT
You know without necessarily having all the supplies and getting into painting and then when I got my first.	CHITCHAT
Painting was in digital and then.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm going also to traditional paintings, so been interesting path back and forth between traditional and digital when I first got into digital art.	CHITCHAT
I stopped doing traditional for like 5 years.	CHITCHAT
And it wasn't like there was a rule or something like Oh, I must stop.	CHITCHAT
I just felt I don't know I just really got hooked in and wanted to focus intensely on one thing.	CHITCHAT
I felt like I was learning photo shop.	CHITCHAT
I was learning.	CHITCHAT
A lot at one time and it felt helpful to me to like really focusing on that, but	CHITCHAT
It was nice finally to like bring them together and start doing both a little bit so.	CHITCHAT
Let me take a look at what time it is.	CHITCHAT
Alright we're doing OK I think uhm.	CHITCHAT
I might work on this for another like 30 minutes.	CHITCHAT
And hopefully we can get it, looking finished in that time.	CHITCHAT
I don't think it's quite there yet, but this scene has a lot of detail in it, so.	O

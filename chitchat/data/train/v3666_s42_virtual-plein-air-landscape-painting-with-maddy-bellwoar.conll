It's OK if it takes a little longer.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the nice comments.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Everybody have you tried sci-fi painting not really.	CHITCHAT
I painted some sci-fi characters.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if that counts?	CHITCHAT
Uhm I haven't done.	CHITCHAT
Like a spaceships or something like that, I feel I feel like it's.	CHITCHAT
It's a lot of technical things in perspective and stuff like that that you need for example.	CHITCHAT
If I did 3D modeling that would be great.	CHITCHAT
'cause then I could model some of those places and paint on Top of it, but I feel like.	CHITCHAT
I mean?	CHITCHAT
I might be just putting restrictions on myself that don't exist.	CHITCHAT
But I feel like for sci-fi.	CHITCHAT
It just requires a lot more.	CHITCHAT
Technical stuff in general, so I really am most inspired by a very natural type of scenes like you see me painting here, you know.	CHITCHAT
Nature and Environment scenes are my favorite.	CHITCHAT
But I do like sci-fi as a John rhe.	CHITCHAT
Since for some reason, it's not what I am really.	CHITCHAT
Inspired to paint.	CHITCHAT
You never know what's going to happen, though.	CHITCHAT
Could be in my future?	CHITCHAT
It did only like character paintings for.	CHITCHAT
In the 1st.	CHITCHAT
Few years that I did digital art.	CHITCHAT
And got into landscape.	CHITCHAT
San now I'm kind of getting starting to paint characters again.	CHITCHAT
If you guys are interested in that maybe I can do some here as well.	CHITCHAT
On portrait or character things In addition to landscapes.	CHITCHAT
Started practice a digital painting, it's so cool, but you're painting in a different form.	CHITCHAT
Nice.	CHITCHAT
Well, thank you for painting with me.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like to try different workflows a lot, so I won't always paint in the exact same way every time.	CHITCHAT
'Cause I feel like I'm always still experimenting to try to find like a new way to do things or.	CHITCHAT
Get a better texture or like I want to try this new brush.	CHITCHAT
I'm always trying different things.	CHITCHAT
So I end up with.	CHITCHAT
And with some different.	CHITCHAT
Workflows and I think there are definitely some patterns certain things that I always.	CHITCHAT
Do but for the most part I do, I do change things up a lot in my painting workflow?	CHITCHAT
Do you like do you suggest anything about color picking it's always a pain when it gets a coloring stage?	CHITCHAT
For me doing a lot of these virtual Plein Air Studies without color picking from the reference really helps so.	CHITCHAT
Just try to look at the reference and guess what you think the color is an then what you can do is if you can't figure it out.	CHITCHAT
Then you can go to your reference and then color pick and see.	CHITCHAT
How it's going so like my colors are not all correct you know you can see they're just differences?	CHITCHAT
Buttom.	CHITCHAT
You will get better at it as you do more and then you can.	CHITCHAT
You won't have to color pics, so much from the reference but use it to like check your work.	CHITCHAT
A little bit.	CHITCHAT
And then try try to practice not doing it, I've done a lot of these paintings Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
I've done, I've done like probably hundreds of them so I don't want that to discourage anyone 'cause people learn all different rates.	CHITCHAT
But I'm just saying, you can definitely you just have to keep doing them you just have to keep doing it.	CHITCHAT
And you will get it like 100% it's going to happen, you're going to get it, but you have to.	CHITCHAT
Make a bunch of paintings.	CHITCHAT
And then you won't need to color pic anymore.	CHITCHAT
And you don't have to make hundreds of paintings to get to that point I was able to paint without color picking like.	CHITCHAT
Earlier on in that stage.	CHITCHAT
But I've just done a lot of them by now.	CHITCHAT
Uhm OK sorry I'm falling behind in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Welcome everybody gains have are I don't know if I'm saying your name right, but welcome an I think mails already answered you but you can download my brushes and anybody who wants to you can download them.	CHITCHAT
Info tab.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Hardest especially when I'm not using reference but drawing something from scratch.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, OK absolutely absolutely.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's really tough.	CHITCHAT
I paint a lot from reference so and even if I were if I were to want to create a new scene for myself.	CHITCHAT
You're a dumb I would probably still try to find a reference that had like a similar lighting scenario or something.	CHITCHAT
And use it as a guide like even if you're trying to make up a new setting it will really.	CHITCHAT
No make it a lot easier.	CHITCHAT
To have accurate look.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this one is from Estonia.	CHITCHAT

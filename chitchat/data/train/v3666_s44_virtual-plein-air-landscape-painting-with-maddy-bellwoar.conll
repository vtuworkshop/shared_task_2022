And this one was in Spain.	O
And this one was the first one location was in Japan, so lots of different moods.	O
Kind of the same idea mainly natural places with a lot of foliage.	O
A couple with pathways.	O
Yeah, I love painting plants and foliage and I've been really wanting to work on textures for keeping a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Keeping a little bit more loose when painting them 'cause.	CHITCHAT
Of course, you can't get in there and paint every leaf you know.	CHITCHAT
Well, you can, but you know it's going to take a long time.	CHITCHAT
So, sometimes it's good for that level of Polish, but other times, you just kind of want to.	O
Hint that things.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Jack Harrer.	CHITCHAT
Do you have?	CHITCHAT
Printed like romance or have I printed my artworks.	CHITCHAT
I have nots?	CHITCHAT
I don't really have a lot of my artwork up at home.	CHITCHAT
I have a couple of my original.	CHITCHAT
I think you know artworks.	CHITCHAT
And I don't print my own work for selling or anything.	CHITCHAT
I tried that in the past along time ago and it's very high maintenance.	CHITCHAT
Printing your own work is really hard to do you know dealing with all the calibration and everything so?	CHITCHAT
I prefer not to.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Molly thank you.	CHITCHAT
When you're finished painting do you use some Photoshop effect sometimes?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm not quite finished with this painting?	CHITCHAT
Yet so.	CHITCHAT
I don't really want to do that, but I didn't get a chance to do, finishing effects on this painting.	CHITCHAT
Earlier, I kind of just ended it and moved on.	CHITCHAT
So I could use this one really quick and show you like some finishing a effects that I might do.	O
This one is not going to make it, it's not going to make it far enough.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, that's a good question.	CHITCHAT
and I don't do a lot, but I'll show you real quick.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
And, Marty.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for the nice comments, which are my most proud of today, Oh Oh.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually pretty happy with how the paintings turned out today, which is nice 'cause you know.	CHITCHAT
You always feel that way I don't always feel that way.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
I kind of.	CHITCHAT
This one's not finished so I feel like it's a little unfair.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I think maybe this one.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure I can feel equally about them.	CHITCHAT
There's there's neither of them are perfect.	CHITCHAT
That's the thing I don't think either of them are like.	CHITCHAT
I could I could about.	CHITCHAT
And that's with a couple more things on both of them.	CHITCHAT
But I'm still happy specially in amount of time, we spent I'm happy about it.	CHITCHAT
But really quick, I'll show you guys, some finishing things that I do.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Emily thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll close this and then that will be yeah.	O
That'll be the end.	O
So uhm some things that I like to do or mess with the adjustment layers.	O
I'm just going to move this out here, so you can.	O
See what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
So I will be a couple of things, so first I generally make a new layer I take the.	O
Airbrush and I often make a little like big net kind of effect.	O
Around the outside.	O
With the airbrush.	O
And you know, I'll choose different colors, depending on what's going on the painting.	O
I usually try to go further warm color, but it can change can vary.	O
And I lower the Opacity.	O
It's really something that you don't want to.	O
You don't want to really notice that it's there.	O
It's supposed to be like.	O
If you didn't know it was there, you wouldn't really notice it, but it just kind of lightly urges the viewer to like.	O
Now that leads your eye more in towards the center of the composition.	O
I think it leads right away from edges by darkening them slightly you know.	O
So I'll do something like that.	CHITCHAT
I also like to sometimes go through adjustment layers things like color balance.	O
Um mostly I do these things, especially if I feel like there's something a little off or not quite right with the with the colors and I want to fix it.	O
But even if they do look good, sometimes I go through and just want to like let's let's play.	O
Go to The Shadows Midtones and highlights on the colour balance, sliders and just like look?	O
How much you can change the mood with this kind of stuff.	O
Like sometimes it's fun to just see like.	O
You can really push the mood further or completely change it.	O
Sometimes it can be a little intimidating because of just how much you can change with these.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can really.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, then you can turn the layer on and off and see.	O
Do you like that?	CHITCHAT

Is there is improvement?	CHITCHAT
Is it said not he decide if you want it you can also go to?	O
We just met layers for levels.	O
Things like that.	CHITCHAT
Brighten things up go a little bit more contrast.	O
Basically, things that I use here are levels curves.	O
Color balance, I like selective color.	O
So, sometimes, I will use that if there's especially if there's one color that I'm not sure if it's really working well.	O
Or like for example, the greens here, I can go to greens and say like.	O
Do we want to make them a lot more yellow?	O
Do we want them to look more.	O
Natural or do we want more blue in the green.	O
Like you can mess with so much.	O
And sometimes it really helps sometimes you don't realize that something is a little off, and when you go into these settings.	O
You can improve stuff that you don't even.	O
No needed improvement, so I like to look just.	O
Turn little visibility on and off and see the changes.	O
The last thing is that I'll do is make a new layer above everything once I know that I like it.	O
And the new blank layer and I'll go to image apply image.	O
So then I have like a merged version of?	O
Everything below the	O
Final layer.	O
Hey shadow craft.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Jackson says I painted along with the last one, I might finish it later.	CHITCHAT
Let's see anyone else who painted along.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to share your work in the chat.	CHITCHAT
Cool, Oh my gosh, it's so interesting to see the.	CHITCHAT
That's tiles from the first painting with the no texture to this, I love.	CHITCHAT
I love the textures.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome work, Jackson.	CHITCHAT
I think he did a really nice job with the Sky.	O
I find I found this guy really difficult.	CHITCHAT
Especially in the beginning when I was working on this one.	CHITCHAT
But I think the opening to the Blue Sky looks really good and really believable.	O
Really, nice, yeah, I hope you finish it.	CHITCHAT
If you have time I would like to see that.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so as far as finishing effects.	O
I like to create a new layer that's merged on Top of everything below and um.	O
Some filters that I like.	O
Would be sharp and you can also use the unsharp mask for some additional options.	O
But usually if I'm just doing a quick study and I'm just want to post it real quick.	CHITCHAT
On social media somewhere, I'll just go to filter sharpen and that's usually enough for me or sharpen more if you really want that but.	O
It's nice how much the sharpen filter makes these digital brushstrokes stand out.	O
I mean, I know we're really zoomed in here, but look at that.	O
It looks so much more like a traditional painting brush stroke with just a little bit of sharpening.	O
Yeah, it's	CHITCHAT
It's nice to see and then another thing is sometimes I'll add a little bit of a noise filter.	O
It's just yeah, it's an effect that can get overdone, but a certain amount of it can be nice to like unify everything in the painting, especially if you have some brushes that have a noisy.	O
Texture another brushes that don't and it's not jiving.	O
We can do that.	O
So that is some of the finishing affect things that I like to do.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
He.	CHITCHAT
Nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK, so for anyone just getting here.	CHITCHAT
Sure, I can or returning.	CHITCHAT
I can show you guys what happened today in the stream 'cause we're.	CHITCHAT
Just about to wrap up but the first painting of the day was this one here.	O
And the second one was the cloudy day one that I was just showing here.	O
And then the last one which is not 100% finished, but I'm a little bit out of time for the day, it's.	O
It's almost done, I would like to add some more detail in the foliage in the foreground and this tree.	O
More openings and patches to show the Sky shining through that would be something nice but.	O
Yeah, it was a really good day, I will probably post these not immediately but usually I post them like.	CHITCHAT
At some point over the next week after completing them on Instagram and I also post.	CHITCHAT
My favorite ones.	CHITCHAT
I'll post here on Behance, but I usually like to try to save the nicer ones.	CHITCHAT
That I feel came out really good.	CHITCHAT
So uhm, yeah, you can check that out, if you want and I will be here again at the same time.	CHITCHAT
Next Wednesday, so that was we started about 4 hours ago, yeah about 4 hours ago.	CHITCHAT
Uhm so yeah, will do the same thing next week and you are always welcome to join me with the studies.	CHITCHAT
I hope you do.	CHITCHAT
I really enjoy seeing your paintings so.	CHITCHAT

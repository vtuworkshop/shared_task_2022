Hey, what's going on everybody fresh cake here for another stream tonight, we're streaming Adobe fresco on the iPad.	O
Again, if you've watched my older streams.	CHITCHAT
You know, I draw on the 6 jet iPad.	CHITCHAT
It's a 9.7 inch screen guys can kind of see here.	CHITCHAT
Who sort of flipped it there a little bit didn't mean to do that in the broadcast.	CHITCHAT
Some things to note, I should probably lock my screen that whatever.	CHITCHAT
Some things to note, I this strong I've already kind of started I started.	O
It actually yesterday and I want to finish it up.	O
But I figured it be kind of fun to finish it up together.	O
So maybe we can all kind of hop in the chat pitch ideas I am making a.	CHITCHAT
Comic strip here inspired by a conversation I recently had and yeah, so you know, we're just going to be kind of doodling so.	O
Like I said, I'm going to do the fresco.	CHITCHAT
I've already kind of laid down the groundwork here, but I can kind of walk you guys through what we got.	CHITCHAT
So let's have these guys so I did a quick just some rough kind of line work here real fast using just like the basic.	O
Pencil in Frisco, so that's under the pixel brushes over here with my other streams in the past, you know that, like.	O
Press got 3 brush sets pixel brush a live brush and a vector brush so I predominantly use the pixel brush.	O
And the vector brushes.	O
So let's see here let's turn these guys back on.	CHITCHAT
So again just to get a little bit of a feel of what's going on here with these characters.	CHITCHAT
I started Doodling, Oh Man, I'm drawing them on 2 separate layers can actually make comic strip out of this so there's going to be multiple panels.	O
And to make it easier on myself to redraw characters, 'cause anyone who draws comics knows that one of the struggles like.	O
One of the struggles with it is consistency with characters, I decided to draw my characters in separate little groups.	O
And then I'm going to duplicate the canvas and then I'll remove the one character for the next panel.	O
Make my alterations to the mouth and the eyes and that kind of stuff but kind of trying to cheat the system here and keep everything all.	O
Sort of uniform so yes, we're just on this one tall kind of slender looking fellow let's see here.	O
Let's make sure we get all the right settings.	O
Yes, I use a basic round brush for the vector brush that I like and yeah, it's pretty it's pretty handy you know.	O
I put a little bit of a paper on it and.	O
I do, I've already kind of?	CHITCHAT
Messed it up right out the gate here.	O
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Give him kind of a fun nose.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you guys will know is that I use the undo.	O
A lot and I should mention frescoes got a really nice shortcut for undo the user 2 fingers and you tap.	O
Oop in tap it will undo something and 3 fingers.	O
Reduce reduce it that's not a word redoes it.	O
I never use that I've gotten so accustomed to just taking the Penan like tapping these 2 icons at the Top so.	O
It's whatever works for you.	CHITCHAT
That's that's how I like to do it.	CHITCHAT
I think I'd get that from.	CHITCHAT
Using like other you know.	CHITCHAT

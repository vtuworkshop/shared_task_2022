If I'm using like Adobe draw illustrator draw that kind of stuff on the iPad it became ingrained in my head.	O
And I started doing it.	O
So a nice little tip here in Frisco.	O
I talk about this all the time in my streams the.	CHITCHAT
Arizona shape tool yet there's a ruler tool to shape tool so to create like really nice circles.	O
I always create a new layer.	O
Pull down.	O
Get the paint bucket.	O
Make it a vector.	O
Deselect.	O
Duplicate.	O
Go over here grab the white.	O
I think everyone kind of I'm kinda breezing through this.	CHITCHAT
I think everyone kind of see what's going on here.	CHITCHAT
I like line, it up nicely.	O
And actually at first thought, this was kind of annoying but I kind of like it now because I can kind of pick where like?	CHITCHAT
In a circle the line is going to be thicker so if I.	O
Remove my selection on that you guys can see here like the thicker line is kind of on the outside.	O
Wow, now, what I want to do the thicker line is kind of like on the outside here, drawing with white.	O
We get a color you guys can all see it's kind of on the outside over here.	O
The reason why do that it's 'cause?	O
The way that you know the angle of it is, we're looking at him from you know like this side.	O
So I want that line to be a little thicker closer to the Camera.	O
So to speak and then the other side will be a little less maybe his eyes kind of rounded and it comes out a little bit in the curvature.	O
Would make that side thinner?	O
So again we just repeat the process duplicate.	O
Phil.	O
Grab that shrink it up nicely.	O
Let's buddies kind of shorter so make him look down.	O
Done.	O
Looks kind of awkward it's got a little bit of a monkey kind of like lazy.	CHITCHAT
I think going that's kind of weird.	CHITCHAT
Yeah something like that.	CHITCHAT
And it's like position, it here.	O
So again if you're new to the new to the new streams and.	CHITCHAT
New the chat for Maine got a couple of new followers over the last few days somebody who might be watching and.	CHITCHAT
You know just learn about my style, I draw mainly in Adobe fresco the newest.	O
Drawing app on the iPad.	O

Old 90s cartoons and fun sort of like.	O
Animated stuff I don't know how else to describe it.	O
I just I really like cartoons.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of where this whole thing is going.	CHITCHAT
So let's see here's shut up bring it over.	O
And cool spend a lot of time on this.	CHITCHAT
I really care about it.	CHITCHAT
Birches together good nice vector layer if you hold down this little guy talking this whole time, too few.	O
Take a little widget here and you hold it down group.	O
And you grab your paint bucket, you tap.	O
It'll remove attacks is like a like a big eraser and it's just kind of like a It's like you selected a shape and then hit delete an illustrator.	O
Just kind of gets rid of that area.	O
And let's duplicate save on time always duplicate size little bigger closer to us.	O
Let's see here sorry got 2 things going now to pens.	CHITCHAT
He's my tablet to control my computer an I use my.	CHITCHAT
You know, Apple pencil for my iPad.	CHITCHAT

Let's just add some like.	O
Eyeball lines 'cause, maybe he's all like this.	O
Light line at all.	O
That line can go to hell.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT

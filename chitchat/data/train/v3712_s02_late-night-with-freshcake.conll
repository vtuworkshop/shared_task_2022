You know naturally inked approach where like made my lines aren't as smooth.	O
I kind of like it 'cause it's creating a little bit more.	O
Variation of my drawings and making my character is a little bit more like I don't know I feel like it.	O
Add a little life to him like this line here, I would have gone through this one right here.	O
I would have gone through like a million times and like trying to get it, so that's like the perfect arc.	O

What are my only eraser I want to be on the racer?	O
Somebody was curious if you look over my layers.	O
I always working in layers like it feels little not you know.	O
Feels a little more non destructive and then I can do things like that, and create really clean lines because.	O
I'm able to erase over Top of whatever the layer is.	O
Underneath or above I can just you know, kind of race behind it, and you get these like really clean sort of connections there instead of worrying about.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT

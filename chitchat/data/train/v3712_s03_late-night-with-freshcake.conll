Cool and again we just very much not concerned actually anything.	CHITCHAT
I'm not concerned at all about this 'cause when I fill in this guy behind or in front of him.	O
This shirt line, you're seeing over here is going to disappear.	O
So we're actually going to leave that 'cause I want to keep that there for when I.	O

Oh, I feel like my music keeps cutting off what is going on?	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Hope you know, I don't have it looked OK.	CHITCHAT
Sorry that the music kept cutting out on everybody.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry, there might have been some dead air there.	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
Had that kind of rebuild my stream set up 'cause I got a new desk if any of you.	CHITCHAT
You know.	CHITCHAT
Donna or have watched my old streams before.	CHITCHAT
You know that I was working on this like really tight sort of kind of smaller desk.	CHITCHAT
Can I recently bought like a nice?	CHITCHAT
Big nicer one.	CHITCHAT
This is going on.	CHITCHAT
I think this guy should have some like chromie kind of whis peas in the front.	O
Don't know what's going on with him.	O
Certainly.	CHITCHAT
In some rough days.	CHITCHAT
Her front.	CHITCHAT
Both these guys man they have, like, horrible haircuts.	O

We can rebuild him.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Cool so we got like 2 Tubby Dad Bods, just cruising through town, they're doing their thing.	O
Like I said, I drew these on different layers on purpose because I want to.	O
One of the utilized both them as individual characters and.	O
Scale them up so I can put like copy and stuff.	O
I'm just going to put this line here just to close that gap now.	O

So we're going to move this layer.	O
Up into here.	O

Let's duplicate this.	O
The reason for that, like I said if you watch my streams.	CHITCHAT
In the past, you know, I don't like to be destructive.	CHITCHAT
Or I could be as.	CHITCHAT
Least destructive as possible, the reason for that is because if this was like a client project and a client came back and they were like.	CHITCHAT
We love what you did, but we really hate like that.	CHITCHAT

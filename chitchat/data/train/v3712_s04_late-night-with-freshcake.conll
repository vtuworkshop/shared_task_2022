This character has eyeballs I don't wanna have to redraw an entire character just to.	O
Make him not have eyeballs so having things in different layers and keeping that kind of like master build.	O
Is always good as a copy because then you can step into it at any point an you know?	O
Make quick corrections without needing to do too much damage to the whole entire piece.	O
Another good reason for that, like on this is.	O
Later, when I pull this character out and do like the close up shot of his face and I want to change.	O
All those features.	O
I'll have that build and I can just go in real fast and.	O
An you know, Taylor, it up and remove like the mouth or change.	O
Whatever I need without having to worry about.	O
You know redrawing anything I don't have to worry about drawing one part.	O
So let's see so this guy is yeah, he's.	CHITCHAT
Dunn's color him in let's also move him above his buddy here.	O
Then why are here let's do the same thing duplicate?	O
Layer group let's merge together done an let's hide that one and let's hide the rough sketch.	O
We don't need that anymore.	O
So let's fill this guy in so we think for colors.	O
Let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Let's make him like a?	CHITCHAT
It's a big fat a dog growing up, I don't know if you guys remember Doug Doug Funny.	O
But they always had like fun colored characters like everyone was like different Oh you know what I noticed.	CHITCHAT
Pretty sure on our bro back here I totally drew his arm lines in the wrong area OK hold on.	O
We gotta go back.	O
We gotta redo some stuff.	O
To grace these?	CHITCHAT
So race that excellently.	O
Forgot what I was doing earlier drill the wrong layers.	O
Yeah, that's one thing to point out always have like layer caution.	O
No, that's a real thing, but you know trying to pay attention to what layers are on definitely important.	O
So they don't make mistakes.	O
Alright so let's keep filling this guy in let's see here it's better paint bucket stranger colors up high.	O
Usually, when I color my pieces.	O
I really don't have a game plan.	O
I wish I could say I did.	CHITCHAT
I just kind of pick things until they look good.	O
I've been really into pink yellow and blue lately and it's kind of been a nice like step starting point.	O
And then I kind of like figure it out from there.	O
But yeah, I don't know like.	O
Colors should be fun.	O
I kind of like that, I'm not like tide down to something specific.	O
Weird orange color, I don't know it's.	O
Paint.	O
Confront.	CHITCHAT
Bootsy.	CHITCHAT
That's it that's what I want.	CHITCHAT
Collect purple, he looks like he's like not getting enough oxygen right now.	O
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
This was like mumbling through that so if you don't hear anyone else laying on the Mike.	CHITCHAT
I apologize so it's just like a?	CHITCHAT
Sound like an old like.	CHITCHAT
Grumpy man like this, I gotta turn on the.	CHITCHAT
Right so let's give this guy like green and like I was filling out nice orange tone for skin.	O
Something like that this dude on the left looks like this guy right here.	O
This guy looks like hold his breath like a man what's going on.	O
It's like you I forgot to breathe always talking.	CHITCHAT
Feel like I want to change his color so bad.	O
I do, I really do.	O
Thinking Blue, Oh, Same color is the shirt.	O
Hello.	CHITCHAT
It looks like he's choking.	O
The facial expression I gave him that's the real problem here.	O
Sure.	CHITCHAT
OK, I like where we're going here.	CHITCHAT
Something like this.	CHITCHAT
I don't know maybe they're just like.	CHITCHAT
Now I like them, not being the same skin tone.	O

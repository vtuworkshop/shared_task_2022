Well, I definitely like his skin tone like that.	O
Let's change.	O
This guy out changes buddy up.	O
Alright I can get down with this?	O
What do we think thoughts?	CHITCHAT
Let me know in the chat?	CHITCHAT
Let's see here these guys up.	CHITCHAT
Oops.	CHITCHAT
The weights to the teeth.	O
Like a fun blue tone for his tongue.	O
'Cause.	CHITCHAT
And then we've got like a tongue problem you know.	CHITCHAT
Scott blue tongue.	O
Don't talk to him.	CHITCHAT
Using brushes teeth like I don't know.	O
Trying to just think of funny things that people would say in this world.	CHITCHAT
Alright I want to hide the background real quick, so I can see my transparency make sure that miss anything.	O
And I'd say they are looking pretty good.	O
I think we need to add some kind of color in the background.	O
I don't know what?	CHITCHAT
But I would like it to maybe like a?	O
No.	O
Grab this.	O
It's got the ruler.	O
The tool I don't use enough.	O
Up.	O
Current news in this orange know he's orange for skin so I can read.	O
Oh boy drawn from a guy.	CHITCHAT
So here.	CHITCHAT
Conventions.	CHITCHAT
Try to move it and nothing happened.	O
That I close it up, I don't think I close the shape.	O
Did I miss something?	CHITCHAT
These guys.	CHITCHAT
You guys are seeing like all my bad stuff that I do.	CHITCHAT
This is the smoke and mirrors part that people don't always see like really bad lines, you know.	O
These guys.	O
And all the hidden things.	O
Sometimes I call them my sins as weird as that sounds.	CHITCHAT
Lower the opacity.	O
Oh boy here we got like 2 buds out for a walk?	O
Who knows what they're talking about.	O
Let's see here.	O
Let's put some shading and some color and all those kinds of fun things in here now.	O
So let me get a new layer and I'm going to go here.	O
And.	O
Black.	O
Grab this.	O
And let's see let's lower this opacity down to like tablet so weird number, but I struggle to get out of 5.	O
Carefully carefully line looks like garbage.	O
So what I'm doing right now, just give me one like.	O
Global Insight, I'm getting ready to cut a drop in some, like really big shadows Oh boy.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Let me restart this layer 'cause that looks awful.	O
I'm actually in a different way.	O
I'm going to grab a brush.	O
Bob this way high.	O
Parallel pressure dynamic.	O
I'm just going to kind of poop.	O
Only passing out of 5, so again making shadows the way I make shadows.	O
I grab the main line color.	O
And sometimes I'll just draw like a rough kind of crude shape and then I'll fill it.	O
But for this, I feel like maybe I want a little bit more control, so I'm using that pressure sensitivity on the brush.	O
Just kind of working it in.	O
So I guess there's like a light source coming from my pads here coming down this way.	O
I'm sure from the words come out.	O
The light source is coming from the Camera basically 'cause that's where this guys looking right here.	O
So let's see let's fill these guys in.	O

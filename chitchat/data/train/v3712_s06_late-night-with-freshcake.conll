It's really hard shadow.	O
I don't know how much I like that.	CHITCHAT
Having various tips and tricks I do whenever I draw.	O
And I just kind of go through them until I find something that works for the piece that I'm creating.	O
So, sometimes, I'll get to a certain point, and I'll be like.	O
Oh, like this worked for whatever drawing I was doing last.	CHITCHAT
On here I kind of hated it the same way.	CHITCHAT
But like right now, I'm looking at it like I don't know if I like this technique.	CHITCHAT
The shadows are really like intense.	O
Wishing undo everything I did.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Their little too thick.	O
Sometimes, things don't require shading they actually require highlights instead and I guess with any good lighting.	O
There's definitely much better artists out there than I.	CHITCHAT
That will sit there and be like Well, you gotta add you know.	O
Shading and highlights and all that kind of stuff to make complete peace.	O
I'm making a cartoon so the.	CHITCHAT
Usually, now, the flatter the color little better if that's a thing lighting is always extremely important.	O
I sometimes just disregard it so like.	O
I'm adding machine right now.	O
Different tricks that I do again I was having fun.	O
Sometimes just to kind of imply that there is like either like a shoulder.	O
Or maybe some kind of death to a character.	O
I'll just grab like a thinner line specials.	O
Little bit and I'll just kind of like poop.	O
About 100 and I'll follow the same color as the highlight and pull out at the end and it kinda implies.	O
There is like some kind of either geometry, there to the body or like maybe there's a light source hitting it right there.	O
Sometimes that works really well, especially if I'm fighting with like trying to shade an object sometimes it's sort of like.	O
I don't know low.	CHITCHAT
Call it like low fi shading.	O
Ends up working really well and kind of working on this character actually kind of digging right now.	O
And sometimes you can go back in later and then like you know actually add in.	O
The shadows around this and it'll look really nice like here can do one.	O
Maybe it'll work.	CHITCHAT
It's like you're kind of like mapping, it in you know.	CHITCHAT
I actually really enjoy that so let's let's let's keep this gravy train rolling here.	CHITCHAT
I think.	CHITCHAT
I think sometimes you gotta change your process to get like a new result, something that you're going to be happy with.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if anyone hears a fan of doom.	CHITCHAT
The video game, but there's really good interview on YouTube with the guy who wrote the music for it.	CHITCHAT
And he talks about that and his famous quote I think in his one of his.	CHITCHAT
Like talks that he did was we changed the process you change the result and sometimes if you're struggling to get?	CHITCHAT
Result that's the best way to find a new one.	CHITCHAT
Change the process it change the result.	CHITCHAT
Cell phones, not working.	CHITCHAT
Things result purchase process.	CHITCHAT
They get new results.	CHITCHAT
There's another artist streaming earlier.	CHITCHAT
Very talented and she was saying that.	CHITCHAT
To redraw things multiple times that's always a good way.	CHITCHAT
Lead sled so glad that she's a new streamer.	CHITCHAT
Here, a very talented artist kind of artists.	CHITCHAT
All link out in my description to our account.	CHITCHAT
To go.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I like that.	CHITCHAT
Thoughts feelings emotions.	CHITCHAT
Just gotta stick with the shading here.	O
Can do that?	CHITCHAT
Boo.	CHITCHAT
Shoot.	CHITCHAT
Hi.	CHITCHAT
Here, I go Rd.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Making layers get real airs out there, so I need to connect Oh boy and there, we have it.	O

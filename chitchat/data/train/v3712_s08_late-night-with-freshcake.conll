Shouting at Passer Byers.	CHITCHAT
Really made.	CHITCHAT
Only.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool so that guy looks like he's done.	O
Well, I had some stuff to his nose.	O
Cool, so let's put all this stuff in one layer.	O
This is the way we call Sky.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I lost his name.	CHITCHAT
We're going to call him when we call this guy.	CHITCHAT
Oh shoot.	CHITCHAT
Do we need these guys well OK so.	CHITCHAT
All this stuff is in will.	CHITCHAT
And then Aw shoot I added in some detail to will.	O
Remember, how I said that I wanted to work on a different layer.	O
I didn't take my own advice earlier an I merge all this stuff.	O
To do the fill and then I added detail and now it's going to be a challenge when I want to swap stuff out not a problem.	O
Will figure it out?	O
Alright so let's see here.	CHITCHAT
Let's take, will and Fred Let's take Fred here real quick.	O
And it's the same thing.	O
Here.	CHITCHAT
Oh wait no, I don't want to add in.	O
Like random lines 1st.	O
So I don't know if this is like a fresco issue or if it's like an iPad thing or what's going on here?	CHITCHAT
I'd love to hear if other people are having this problem that are using the same app as I am.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
So we hit this and then you go to put it away.	CHITCHAT
I always want to tap the pen stroke.	CHITCHAT
To hide it and like it's working right now, but see right there and then sometimes it just flashes and comes right back up like it's doing right now, so I don't.	CHITCHAT
I like a little annoying 'cause, it doesn't go away until I start drawing again.	CHITCHAT
It's not like a make or break but it is.	CHITCHAT
Can be a little the pain the butt sometimes try to like see something behind it?	CHITCHAT
Specifically.	CHITCHAT
Canvas.	CHITCHAT
Canvas around.	O
Stoney just.	O
Let's see here.	O
All right.	O
To those guys.	CHITCHAT
Staples.	CHITCHAT
This guy is going to have less.	CHITCHAT
I don't think.	CHITCHAT
Sorry noticing something here with will.	O
Want to add in some highlights that I do it like.	O
Open here.	O
Well, it's like Big Dome and on his shoulder.	O
Then maybe on his belly.	O
'Cause, like that would catch the light 'cause I could just out.	O
So add highlights the same way.	O
Actually, I don't think that we're losing highlights.	O
I had highlights, though the same way, at shadows.	O
A white and black and then opacity change it, you know, either raise it up or turn it down.	O
Oh 'cause I have weights.	O
Figure out what happened to my machining disappeared only.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Keep it.	O
Wrong thing.	O
Here.	O
Pretty rad going right now.	CHITCHAT
Noticing this is I'm working on it right now.	CHITCHAT
If anyone here follows burnt toast.	CHITCHAT
Incredible artists.	CHITCHAT
Very talented.	CHITCHAT
And I feel like I've got a style that's looking relatively similar currently.	CHITCHAT
Boo.	CHITCHAT
Cool, things to aspire to.	CHITCHAT
Let's see here.	O
Excuse me for a second why scratch it.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	O
So this stuff all in.	O
Yeah, you better do that.	O

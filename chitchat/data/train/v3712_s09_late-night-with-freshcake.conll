So.	CHITCHAT
So we went to notice.	O
I paint right off the canvas.	O
I always encourage that with anyone I talked to about making art.	O
Extend your lines like that stuff, going to cut off anyway.	O
When you export.	O
It's going to make cleaner lines going to look better.	O
Don't be afraid to draw off of the area that you kind of set for yourself, you know, I've seen people far too often try to like get really granular with it and they're like.	O
In there like drawn right up to the line and imitating it right now like I'm doing it, I'm not.	O
Right.	CHITCHAT
You know it's you don't need to do that.	O
I say draw over the line draw outside the canvas think outside the box.	O
You know.	CHITCHAT
Extender work.	O
You have a more complete looking piece when you're done.	O
OK.	O
Set up here.	O
I thought I did.	CHITCHAT
Just notice I accidentally made a little random dot down there.	O
OK, cool so.	CHITCHAT
That some guys there hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Guess I should shave this side of the students face.	CHITCHAT
Make it make sense and everything else right.	CHITCHAT
Let's hear let's turn on pressure dynamics.	O
Slime.	O
Like.	CHITCHAT
Jimmy Fallon does that one character.	CHITCHAT
Like out.	CHITCHAT
Sweet and let's finish this up so shut the shading here.	O
I'm just going to come from down here.	O
Go right up through this guys lips.	O
No, we're not that's too far.	O
Great underneath that I.	O
Latin.	CHITCHAT
Trace back over this line so that we can close it up.	O
Who got one off a little bit all good?	CHITCHAT
We're going to fill?	O
Now it looks terrible.	O
Not sure do it.	O
Again big part of this is just experimenting and figuring out what works.	CHITCHAT
There's no right or wrong way to do it.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's add some shading in here.	O
Just looked up the stream notice we got some new people watching.	CHITCHAT
You know if you're new.	CHITCHAT
You're hanging out if your new follower mine if you're just.	CHITCHAT
And I'm here just in Behance and saw that there is a live stream of fresco going on and want to watch see what it's all about feel free to ask questions.	CHITCHAT
I use fresco.	CHITCHAT
Every day.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Be happy to answer any questions, you just hop right in the chat should be either under the video or next to it.	CHITCHAT
We can talk shop and yeah.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of getting creative over here.	CHITCHAT
No real plan.	CHITCHAT
I want to turn this into a comic strip.	O
I have some ideas of what they're going to be talking about.	O
But I'm not going to give that stuff away just yet.	O
However, you want to think of this line.	CHITCHAT
Oof.	CHITCHAT
However, I'm going to show you how much I make my panels out of these guys.	O
After I find a way to make this line nice and straight.	O
Up the ruler talk loud.	O
I'm better than that.	CHITCHAT
Works for me.	CHITCHAT
Oh, wow, wow wow.	CHITCHAT
Let me do it here.	O
There we go.	O
Can I do it on this one like just freehand it?	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
You really zoom in on the piece you wanna see that close whatever more power to you.	O

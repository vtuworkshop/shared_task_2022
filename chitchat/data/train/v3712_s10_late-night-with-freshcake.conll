Let's move all these layers down under here alright, so for my comic that I was going to make.	O
I was going to have 3 panels.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
One wide to establish the 2 characters and then one close up of each with different facial expressions so.	O
The way that I want to do that was, I'm actually going.	O
Take this whole thing here this whole tire image.	O
I'm going to back back out to my home is going to save my document.	O
And here we got down here now in Adobe fresco when you're in the menu.	O
The way to go about moving documents.	O
I wish you would add those 3 dots to like the bottom here if I just click this nothing happens.	O
And now I'm opening the document up again, yeah, actually go to cloud documents, which is where all of your work will be and you can see all the fun stuff, I've made.	O
And here's some of these things have streams by the way some of them I make my own time.	CHITCHAT

Where to look at, I feel so FC share panel so we're going to go here go actually duplicate this layer.	O
Where we name it?	CHITCHAT
Not copy or call panel.	O

Oh rename document after syncing is complete, OK, let's wait for it to sink.	O
Well, while it's figuring that out, we're going to open this up.	O
'Cause the new document.	O
We're going to hide this character here.	O
You have some weird lines going on down there don't worry about those.	O
'Cause we're going to actually scale this entire scene up.	O
Grab our one character scale him up.	O
But him right here dead center.	O
Right we're going to actually take these 2 layers merging together so that it's easier.	O
Scale them up.	O
And now we've got.	O

Keeping the This guy like over here and having this layer that I could just freely.	O
You know edit and then I went ahead and add a ton of detail and totally.	O
Screwed myself over so I'm actually going to step in really quick and I'm just going to do.	O
A couple of things to facial expression.	O
I want to do is really easy so I'm actually just going to take this.	O
Kind of I'm actually just grab paint bucket was going to fill in all this stuff because.	O
In my new facial expression none of that existed.	O
And we're going to go over here and erase.	O

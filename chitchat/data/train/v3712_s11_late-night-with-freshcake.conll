Come over here.	O
Tiny face Oh, he had like a chin earlier, see that's why we did this, because in comics is always hard to maintain like consistency 'cause you forget.	O
Or at least I forget.	CHITCHAT
I'm sure people who draw comics regularly.	CHITCHAT
All sorts of tips and tricks to avoid that but I know alright so there.	CHITCHAT
Now we have our other panel.	O
Or second panel if you will going to save out.	O
Go back to this panel whoops, Nope don't open that.	O
Duplicate.	O
Apparently my syncing is not syncing, but that's OK.	O
And again we're going to repeat that same process so we're going to actually hide this, dude now.	O
And we're going to grab this guy.	O
We're going to.	O
Elect him or blow him up now.	O
Play some big.	CHITCHAT
You know it will fill the frame with them.	O
Maybe take its cut off.	O
It's 1 less thing about vectors.	O
You can just like scale am infinitely you can do whatever you want with it really.	O
We also worry about things being you know perfect.	CHITCHAT
And this, dude kinda has he was going to have.	CHITCHAT
Life advice.	CHITCHAT
Kind of the angle I was going to take.	O
There.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Now let's redraw his mouth.	O
There wasn't much shading going on it or anything, so will be super quick.	O
Boat.	CHITCHAT
I can't remember.	CHITCHAT
The hell is that?	CHITCHAT
Big brush.	O
We're doing strictly vector on this one.	O
All right, so we're going to draw a mouth real fast.	O
Real quick math, let's see what does he's giving advice so his mouth might look something like?	O
We had some teeth.	O
So my teeth are pretty simple.	O
For my other streams you know they're just little half circles that overlap.	O
Or not even half circles are like little quarter circles.	O
Something kind of like this.	O
Wait.	CHITCHAT
OK, I don't know what I just did.	CHITCHAT
That was weird as not his mouth look like before.	O
Let's see here.	O
Now I just Jack this up.	CHITCHAT
They look terrible.	O
Samarasinghe.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy.	CHITCHAT
It's going to weird looking math now, let's see here.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Take me to do that let's just.	O
Probably know what I want this mouth look like.	O
I should be open 'cause, he's talking.	O
You know what?	CHITCHAT
Siskey, but we had resumed in why not?	CHITCHAT
Why fix something that you know it's not broken?	O
So, in any case, if we go back here whoops.	O
If we go back to the home page.	O
You'll notice at the Top of my saved documents there's a whole bunch.	O
Of it will be the three panels.	O
Scroll down these 3 panels at the Top here.	O
Underneath where it says cloud document sort by date modified or go back to home.	O
It'll be better.	O
Those are my 3 panels to my comic and it was really quick to do.	O
By just drawing extreme for maybe an hour.	CHITCHAT
I think I came into this kind of started a little bit of it already before I started streaming so if you go back and watch a replay you'll notice.	CHITCHAT
That you know it had kind of already been partially you know on its way.	CHITCHAT
But it really.	CHITCHAT
I did most of this in under an hour and a half.	CHITCHAT
We got 3 solid panels.	O
I'm going to be able to drop some speech balloons in there now actually tell a story.	O
I do have a story written out by the way for this.	CHITCHAT
It's not just something that I like made up.	CHITCHAT
I'm on the spot, it's not that I was making random panels.	O
But by drawing each character individually putting them in their own groups.	O
I was able to quickly create more panels.	O

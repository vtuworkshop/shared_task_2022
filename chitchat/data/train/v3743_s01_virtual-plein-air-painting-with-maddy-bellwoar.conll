I'm going to let you guys know my goals with this and.	CHITCHAT
What I'm trying to practice with it?	CHITCHAT
I think one of the important things with this image is going to be simplification.	O
I'm going to be trying to Simplify and organize what's going on here 'cause right now, it's just like chaos and I do want it to feel like?	O
Something.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't have anything there yet.	O
The info tab doesn't have anything.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Is that what you were talking about Mills?	CHITCHAT
I.	CHITCHAT
It's showing up on my end, but I can.	CHITCHAT
Exit an do it again.	CHITCHAT
Are my brushes showing there though?	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Give me one moment you guys want to make sure that the references.	CHITCHAT
Easily accessible for you.	CHITCHAT
Let's take an extra second here.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
The brushes showed OK I'm going to put it under the stream description.	O
All right, so it's under the stream description as well in case the info tab doesn't work.	CHITCHAT
That way.	CHITCHAT
You can at least find it somewhere.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's get started here.	CHITCHAT
R.	CHITCHAT
Kelly says are going to be working on this one, the whole stream or is it a speed.	CHITCHAT
I will be working on it, the whole stream so this will be probably around 4 hour painting.	CHITCHAT
I've been spending around 3 to 4 hours on these paintings.	CHITCHAT
On these streams and just working on one painting for the whole time.	CHITCHAT
Thank you my love.	CHITCHAT
I wonder why yeah, some of the.	CHITCHAT
Things that I've been added entering on.	CHITCHAT
On my end haven't been yeah, there, we go OK mails that should be good now.	CHITCHAT
Alright.	CHITCHAT
Sorry guys were having a little a couple little tech things but I think we're good now.	CHITCHAT
So my.	CHITCHAT
My canvas size is.	O
3000 by around yeah around 3000 by 1900 pixels.	O
Let's just make that 3000 by 2000.	O
I like to be a nice round Number.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
All of this on the other monitor.	CHITCHAT
Alright and I'm also going to use pure ref to put the reference image up here just so you can.	O
See what I'm working on.	O
What does the 72 resolution mean?	O
Resolution Oregon.	O
Like DPI, That has to do with the image image size?	O
How many pixels per inch.	O
They your images when you're working with the web images.	O
Normally you'll work in 72 resolution if you want ever print something out.	O
You want it to be in 300 Resolution 300 DPI that's going to be better quality for printing.	O
So it depends on what your goals are with the artwork.	O
What kind of size.	O
You want to make it.	O
Um if you are planning to print something out you probably want to work in 300.	O
DPI and make sure that just make sure that the image is large enough.	O
In the end, the most important thing is that you just have enough pixels if you have uh.	O
If you have a 10,000 by 10,000 size image pixel image at 72 resolution well.	O
That's fine.	O
There's still plenty of pixels.	O
You can switch it to 300 and print it out and it's going to be fine.	O
But Long story short if you make a small if you're looking if you set things up as inches or centimeters for example.	O
And you want to let's say you want to make an 8 by 10 print of something you set it up like this.	O
8.	O
By 10 inches.	O
S 72 if you want to print out an 8 by 10 print of your image.	O

It's not going to look good.	O
You need to make sure that this is 72 mean that this is 300 not 72.	O
If you want it to be a nice print.	O
That being said, if you switch all of this to pixels.	O
You'll see that this is all in your image size.	O
Menu here, the way the photo shop does this, if you switch between pixels inches centimeters.	O
It's going to.	O
Automatically calculate it for you so if you have.	O
72 resolution.	O
Size document with these.	O
Dimensions and you go to pixels.	O
It's going to tell you how many pixels it is so.	O
I don't know if that I don't know if that helps I don't know if that answers your question.	CHITCHAT
But basically if I wanted to make some if I wanted to see like 300 by 200.	O
If I put this too.	O
C300.	O
Yeah, it's You can look into it just just read up on it.	CHITCHAT
There's tons of information about this.	CHITCHAT
It's definitely something that's uh like basic important thing to understand if you're getting into digital painting.	CHITCHAT
Story short Photoshop makes it pretty easy, but you want to make sure that you.	CHITCHAT
If you're going to, if you want to print something out.	O
You need to make sure you have enough pixels.	O
I need to make sure it's 300 DPI.	O
OK let's get into painting.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the only reason I think I confused at more, but there's like a common misconception.	O
I'm going to save my file and then will start being thing.	O
There's a common misconception that just putting something in 300.	O
DPI means you're good to go and you can print it nicely.	O
If you still make a small file at 300.	O
DPI that doesn't help you that much lower just keep in mind like?	O
The overall pixel size is important too.	O
Up.	O
So this is in Malaysia.	O
Malaysia waterfall that's what we'll call this.	O
Alright so if anybody wants to join in with painting this, you're welcome to take the reference image from.	CHITCHAT
Below the description and do a study with me, I'd love to see what you do, I'm going to explain?	CHITCHAT
My.	CHITCHAT
Process as I go and if you have any questions, you can let me know.	CHITCHAT
Hi there or not I.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
OK so I want to try to break this down into something that's a little bit more easy to understand.	O
An I can give some tips really quick some things that I do to the reference image sometimes to help study it before I.	O
Even get going with painting.	O
Sometimes I'll turn the reference into black and white and take a look at it like this and see if I can.	O
Take any extra steps to understand the value structure.	O
So for example.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to paint on Top of my reference on another layer really quick.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
If I look at some areas where there's already shadows.	O
I can decide if I want to block off a darker area.	O
There, too, like what do you want your value structure to be an can we exaggerate it like?	O
There's light bright light coming through here, so there's like a triangle type shape in the middle and then.	O
Around at that there's some shadows is kind of what I'm seeing.	O
And maybe so maybe something like that is.	O
Like roughly To what I see when I'm looking at this so.	O
Sometimes exaggerating those things can help how can we live stream on Behance I think you can request.	O
Is there not a pop up for you?	CHITCHAT
When you log in?	CHITCHAT
I know for a while that was showing up when you log in and you're you're on your account.	CHITCHAT
There's like a pop up like would you be interested in?	CHITCHAT
Streaming and you can request the permission for that, if you don't see something like that.	CHITCHAT
I'm not exactly sure.	CHITCHAT
I don't know maybe there's a contact.	CHITCHAT
I'll have to ask maybe how I can help with that for next.	CHITCHAT
Next stream, I didn't expect to get that kind of question and I actually don't know the answer.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry and I'll die but maybe you can contact someone at the hands.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I was invited to stream here.	CHITCHAT
So that's how I got started but I'm not sure where you should go to do that.	CHITCHAT
Maybe there's a contact button somewhere here on the site that you can.	CHITCHAT
You can ask for help.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
So far, everyone I worked with at the House has been super helpful so I think if you message them, they will.	CHITCHAT
They will answer you.	O

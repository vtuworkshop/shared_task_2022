OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start with the horizon line sketching that in where it roughly where I predict the horizon to be.	O
Hi son how are you welcome?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
For me, I'm going to put that sort of it like the line, where the water from the rocks on the waterfall come together something.	O
Like this.	O
An I'm just going to sketch loosely.	O
I'm not worried about my sketch looking great, it's just kind of.	O
Get warmed up and look around.	O
Um at the composition make some decisions on where things are going to go.	O
We have some trees up here.	O
Alright so.	O
I'm going to do another sketch, you can do separate thumbnail sketches as well, and save them and keep them separately.	O
But for me here, I'm probably just going to do a couple sketches and see what I like so there's a pool of water in the center.	O
Surrounded by rocks, I might change some things about the composition to make a more pleasing seen here.	O
I don't want it to feel flat.	O
I think one thing that will help is keeping this waterfall.	O
A little bit more in the distance whoops accidentally painted on that here.	O
Hi go Boo.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
We have some rocks over here.	O
That are closer.	O
And then there's a log like a fallen tree here.	O
Coming across.	O
For those of you who are painting along I hope you have a good time with this reference I.	O
I know it's a difficult one.	O
Feel free to change things if you see any opportunities to make the composition were interesting for yourself.	O
If you want to go along if you want to, if anything that I do is helpful you're welcome to.	O
To make any of those changes.	O
But I'm just going to try to make sense of this is the most I can one of the reasons that I picked this reference was because.	O
Yeah, it was a busy one with a lot of foliage.	O
An these are the type of scenes that.	O
While I love how they look at, I sometimes struggle with organizing.	O
What's going on in the scene and understanding it?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Why are there so many trolls today Jesus?	CHITCHAT
Um there's a pop up line in the left hand side asking our interest in life.	O
Thank you go Boo OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad it's showing up for some of you.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
So let's continue.	CHITCHAT
Sorry about that you guys.	CHITCHAT
So let's have a relaxing let's have a relaxing painting session.	CHITCHAT
Some people sadly don't understand the artistic process.	CHITCHAT
But don't be discouraged.	CHITCHAT
Just have fun with it.	CHITCHAT
As you guys know who watch my paintings regularly I don't.	CHITCHAT
I don't value the.	CHITCHAT
Being a perfectionist with the sketch sketch is not.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
The point of a sketch is not to to look beautiful, but to plan to brainstorm to think.	CHITCHAT
Uh that's OK Mills that's night, it's not your fault.	CHITCHAT
Good luck Jackson I'm yeah, I'm so sorry for picking such a difficult one.	CHITCHAT
But I know you enjoy challenge so.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
So anyway like I was saying the whole point of sketches to just think through what you're going to do compositionally.	CHITCHAT

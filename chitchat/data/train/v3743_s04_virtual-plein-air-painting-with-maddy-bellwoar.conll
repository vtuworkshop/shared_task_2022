Make some plans for how the scene is going to look.	CHITCHAT
You really don't want to get caught up in being perfectionist about this?	CHITCHAT
What about illustrator.	CHITCHAT
What reason you choose photo shop.	O
Illustrator is great for really clean designs and vector type things but I mostly paint, Indiana rasterized format.	O
I like to.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I have a lot of blending and textures in my painting and so it's better for me to paint it photo shop.	O
It's just like the type of art that I'm doing is easier.	O
To work with photo shop for it.	O
There's a lot of tools specifically for painting and kind of mimicking.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Mimicking.	CHITCHAT
Traditional brushes and there's things like the mixer brush.	O
Stuff like that is really nice to.	O
Nice to work with so.	O
Uhm you on high bear.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I can't read what you wrote in the chat.	CHITCHAT
If you can speak English.	CHITCHAT
Please do because otherwise I can't sadly communicate with you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for translating Mills thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
You want I'm sorry if I'm saying Your name right, but thank you for the comment.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I think this is enough of a sketch to for me to have an idea of what I'm going to do.	CHITCHAT
And let's be brave let's just get started.	CHITCHAT
I think this is one of those scenes that I'm going to have to figure it out with shapes.	O
I don't think that we can really.	O
Make a line drawing that's going to clean everything up for me, yeah, I think we're going to just start painting.	O
Anne will clean things up as we go.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
And lower the opacity lock the.	O
Layer.	O
And.	O
I think I will pick a warm underpainting type color so.	O
When I from painting the painting I don't always choose the exact same type of.	O
The exact same type of workflow for something like this, because it's so messy and textured and there's it's.	O
Yeah, there's just a lot going on, I want my painting to feel.	O
To have a variety of textures.	O
I wanted to have like an underlying warmth.	O
Even though there's a lot of green and some cool colors.	O
There's a lot of warmth here.	O
So I think we're going to go with the sort of traditional painting kind of approach and see how that takes us.	O
So I'm going to do something that you see a lion traditional painting, which is create an underpainting.	O
So let's try that.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to pick a color that's something remotely similar to a burnt Sienna.	O
And I'm just going to paint in the background to get rid of the white canvas.	O
I can also choose a brush that has.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Color dynamics color dynamics is a brush setting that.	O
You can play with the huge jitter saturation jitter brightness jitter.	O
Check color dynamics on your brush palette when you make a brush stroke.	O
With each stamp of the brush is going to slightly change the color there and this can be kind of cool.	O
I mean look.	CHITCHAT
It's a little trippy, but it gives it gives a lot of Hue variation and if you're going for a traditional look.	O
Nice maybe at first, it looks weird.	O
But once we start building up the painting.	O
That's very cool.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
The thing that I think I.	CHITCHAT
Missed an underpainting stage in the past, is that it's not only about putting a solid color back in there.	O
You can actually use underpainting to start figuring out a little bit of your value structure also and this is something that I never have really done before and I saw it in a?	O
In a demo that the underpainting can also be used to plan out value structure so.	O
So, just a little bit.	O
I will use this underpainting too.	O
To paint in that triangle?	O
You know, we're going to have some light coming through the.	O
The trees up at the tops shining down hitting the water here.	O
And this is the main shape that we see, there's also going to be some.	O

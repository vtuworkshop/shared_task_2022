Pretty good.	O
Shadows.	O
And I'm using a brush that doesn't get I mean, it's very, very big very textured, but we're not getting into detail.	O
Now at all, so you can see.	CHITCHAT
Just the beginning stages.	CHITCHAT
Alright so this is on you.	CHITCHAT
Experiment for me, I haven't painted like this before with this exact.	CHITCHAT
Workflow with the underpainting so.	CHITCHAT
We'll see how it works.	CHITCHAT
So, just a little bit of the value structure, OK, so I'm going to merge that down to the background.	O
So we basically have this crazy layer.	O
And then a layer with our sketch.	O
I'm going to make a new layer on Top of this one and then we're actually going to start.	O
The painting here so.	O
Let's do it, I think.	CHITCHAT
I think I'd like to start with a brush that gives a little bit more.	O
A little bit more.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
What's the word like a foundation sharp edges, blocking in that's what I want to do?	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to grab it grey.	O
And start roughly painting in some rock shapes now if you can't see your sketch anymore like with me.	O
I'm just going to go and up the opacity of the sketch layer.	O
A little bit so I can see it better again.	O
Some of the darker things in the background and made it more difficult.	O
When using underpainting you don't use any brushes that don't have transfer.	O
Um that doesn't really mean anything to me like whether it has transfer or not, that's just a coincidence Mills like that, they happen to do.	CHITCHAT
Have it or not have it the only thing that matters really is.	CHITCHAT
The result of the underpainting does it will call you want?	CHITCHAT
But like whether or not the brushes have transfer doesn't really matter.	CHITCHAT
That's just a personal preference thing.	CHITCHAT
Hi there Tomas.	CHITCHAT
I am using a Wakeham Centriq 22 with a stylus.	O
Not a mouse so I'm drawing on the screen.	O
It would be really difficult to do with the mouse because I use a lot of brushes that have pressure sensitivity.	O
So it's really helpful to be able to draw on a tablet.	CHITCHAT
You don't have to have a screen tablet of course.	CHITCHAT
But having a tablet with pressure sensitivity makes it a lot easier to do this kind of painting.	O
So, just blocking in some.	O
Rocks early stages.	O
At this point, it's not really going to look like anything but you gotta trust that workflow go through the motions.	CHITCHAT
Until.	CHITCHAT
That's that's important thing about having a workflow like even though I haven't done this underpainting before basically now that that's done, I'm going to my normal workflow, which is.	O
You know painting in the big shapes first relatively beginning with a mid tones and then, adding shadows and highlights.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
So it's important to it's important to have a workflow or just like a way that you kind of look at order in which you do things and it's OK.	O
If it changes like for me.	CHITCHAT
My workflows change a lot of noise.	CHITCHAT
Experimenting with new ones.	CHITCHAT
But it does help like in the early stages of the painting.	CHITCHAT
Do you like have a sort of method that you go through that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
Interest in upgrading this skill for my next works nice if you have any questions, you can let me know.	CHITCHAT
So I want to look in black-and-white repeatedly as I go.	O
You can set this up as a shortcut for yourself.	O
If you want to set that up, you can go to view.	O
Proof set up.	O
Custom and then under proof conditions set the device to simulate to working great gain 20% and then press OK.	O
Mines already set up.	O
And so at once you do that every time you press control why it's going to turn your painting into black and white.	O

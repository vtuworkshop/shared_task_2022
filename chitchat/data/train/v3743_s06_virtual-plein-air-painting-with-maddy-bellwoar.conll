And you can just take a quick look at it and then turn it back another really handy thing about this.	O
Is wallets in black-and-white you can color pic and paint an it will color pic and paint in color?	O
Um so you can paint in the black and white mode and then go back to color and yeah, it's really, really cool.	O
If you this is.	CHITCHAT
This is something unique to photo shop that I use all the time.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we're going to add some foliage next and I'm going to just try to start blocking in greens.	O
Just so we get the overall overall.	O
Green in the right place.	O
So we want some more blue greens notice in the shadows.	O
The leaves type kind of tend a little bit more towards.	O
Blue green and in areas that are having a splash of light, hitting them.	O
The greens become more saturated and yellow green and vibrant green.	O
So I'm painting with a really large brush right now as you can see it's nice to start with a larger brush.	O
And then Get more specific as you get into details of your painting.	O
This is something that I do when I'm doing traditional painting.	O
And I've tried to do it in digital also.	O
Start with a larger brush and try to kind of use a larger brush for as long as you can.	O
To get some nice.	O
Queen shapes.	O
Now the background, the Sky in this case is really, really light.	O
Light blue maybe I mean in the reference.	O
It looks almost white because I think just the exposure of the photo.	O
But we can make it.	O
A little bit more actually light blue.	O
You can download my brushes if you want them.	CHITCHAT
Thomas you can just check the info tab.	CHITCHAT
Above the chat.	CHITCHAT
I've collected brushes an made some of my own.	CHITCHAT
Over the course of 6 years.	CHITCHAT
Of doing digital painting.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome, I hope you like them.	CHITCHAT
I change my brushes often because.	O
I don't know I like trying new brushes there fun to play with and fun to make so I often.	O
Uh-huh.	CHITCHAT
I often change up my.	O
My brushes.	O
All right.	O
So I think I will merge this down.	O
I mean, even though it looks a bit like a hot mess at the moment.	O
Um we're kind of on track for.	O
This, as far as this workflow how I expect things to.	O
To look at this stage?	O
We can start bringing in some darker values.	O
Some shadows and that will start to give shape to things here.	O
I have some good brushes are never too much.	O
Yeah, exactly that's how I feel you can always try some extra brushes.	O
So I I have lately just fallen in love with putting purple in the shadows.	CHITCHAT
When I'm painting it's something that I notice.	CHITCHAT
Does exist in real life?	CHITCHAT
Maybe I exaggerated a little bit but purple and blue especially on a nice?	O

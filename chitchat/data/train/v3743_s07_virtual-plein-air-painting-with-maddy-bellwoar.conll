Sunny day is something that you will notice in the shadows that will have.	O
Bounce light and They will have that kind of effect.	O
They will have a little bit of.	O
Tint of blue.	O
Or purple.	O
And it's just a little bit of a nice variation, the little bit more fantasy type of feeling.	O
Even though we're painting, something that's real and what I've seen with a waterfall.	O
We can still make it feel a little bit more special.	O
A little bit more.	O
You know fantastical.	O
We can just you know exaggerate as artist you can exaggerate what you like.	O
About the scene.	O
So we have, I was going to do a 3 to 4, probably 4 hour stream today, depending on how?	CHITCHAT
You know faster painting goes and I want to get the painting to a nice finished polished place by the end of the day.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's see let me see what time it is.	CHITCHAT
Alright so we have a lot of time left.	CHITCHAT
We're just at the beginning here so we should be able to get this looking good and it's nice to.	CHITCHAT
It's nice to be able to spend a little bit more time on one of these.	CHITCHAT
I do a lot of very quick studies.	CHITCHAT
And I.	CHITCHAT
Don't get a chance to indulge in the details as much so for this one.	CHITCHAT
It will be nice to get things cleaned up.	O
As we zone in more and more as the painting goes on will be able to.	O
Turn this abstract scene into something.	O
Alright so maybe I should have saved the other layers just so I could have made like A.	O
Step by step, she will start now saving the layers as we go through so you can kind of see how it builds up.	O
Also thanks for coming over everybody.	CHITCHAT
I hope you have a good day and that you enjoy the stream.	CHITCHAT
If you have any questions, you can let me know.	CHITCHAT
So I think one thing that would really benefit would be to.	O
Figure out The lighting.	O
Would be to start establishing that?	O
The whole value structure, Hey, Bros welcome.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Oh no worries.	CHITCHAT
No worries, I'm trying a technique today.	CHITCHAT
That is something more what's done in the traditional painting and I'm kind of trying to digital?	CHITCHAT
Version of that, so it's going to be a good experiment.	CHITCHAT
It's uh.	CHITCHAT
Basically, I made more of an underpainting like what you might see in A.	O
I could wash or oil painting.	O
And I'm trying that out.	O
But yeah, if you want to check out the reference.	CHITCHAT
You can look below the stream as always.	CHITCHAT
Icing thank you welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
It's very nice of you.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
So these Brooks here have little splashes of light on them and that's going to help start establish the.	O
Establishing the shapes of individual rocks.	O
And letting us be able to see that there.	O
They have some form.	O
Hi Maria's.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking for a color to add some shadow to the rocks, but they don't get very dark.	O
There's a couple areas that have shadow, but mostly the.	O
The rocks here they are, they're pretty light.	O
They're getting hit by there in the lightest part of the painting.	O
So even the areas of the rocks that are darker, they're not very, very dark.	O
There to learning welcome if you have any questions, you can let me know.	CHITCHAT
I'm also learning.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
And teaching what I do know I'm happy to, I'm happy to share whatever I do know.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Also learning as well.	CHITCHAT
One of my favorite ways to learn is just try new things.	CHITCHAT

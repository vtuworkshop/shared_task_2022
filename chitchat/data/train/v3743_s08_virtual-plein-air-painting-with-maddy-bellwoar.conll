Thiago's Never tried this before, but after watching you working I'm definitely going to try Oh that's cool to hear.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
I have seen a few a few painters working this way.	CHITCHAT
Over the last.	CHITCHAT
Year so that I started to really look into digital.	CHITCHAT
Landscape painting and Plein air painting and yeah, digital and traditional.	CHITCHAT
And it's been interesting to see how you can bring traditional techniques into.	CHITCHAT
Digital painting.	CHITCHAT
And get a different feel.	CHITCHAT
So want to zoom out on my reference really quick an.	O
I didn't recreate the rocks exactly as they are in the reference and I'm trying to decide.	O
If that's if that's a problem or not for me like I'm trying to decide how important it is.	O
That the rocks are where they are in this reference and I don't think it's so important.	O
As long as the composition feels nice and the rock shapes believable.	O
So I'm going to.	O
Stick it easy, see where it goes.	O
How do you choose in which style you're going to do your stuff hi Anna?	CHITCHAT
Thank you brother thank you.	CHITCHAT
Um a lot of a lot of what I choose comes from.	CHITCHAT
I like to watch a lot of tutorials.	CHITCHAT
Other live streams.	CHITCHAT
I like to follow artists on different social media platforms.	CHITCHAT
I like to go for.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if if if someone's having a workshop.	CHITCHAT
I like to try to attend workshops when I can.	CHITCHAT
And so basically I see different processes and it makes me curious to try them and so today for example.	CHITCHAT
I saw this reference an I thought the scene looked like something that would make sense to try a more traditional.	CHITCHAT
Painting style so I decided to try that.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it definitely comes a lot of my inspiration definitely comes from seeing other artists work.	CHITCHAT
Thank you go Boo.	CHITCHAT
All right uhm, I wonder.	CHITCHAT
Maybe maybe I can turn off my sketch layer soon.	O
As I think earlier my sketches really just too.	O
Roughly plan out where things are going to go.	O
Ask the question of previous post will OK things are scrolling up very fast for me.	CHITCHAT
Mill says sorry for answered this before trying to understand underpainting process.	CHITCHAT
I was wondering if the brushes, too, opaque that the underpainting wouldn't show at all.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
It depends on the person how light or dark you want the underpainting to be so in opaque brush.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Might be.	O
Fine or not fine.	O
It's all personal preference does that make sense Mills.	CHITCHAT
Like it's not a right or wrong or too opaque or not opaque like.	O
Because it's a personal preference thing of how you want it to be.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Like people have different intentions.	O
Some people do very light under paintings and just looked into the paper a little bit.	O
And other people want to figure out the whole value structure.	O
Also, the whole underpainting thing is still knew to me and I'm experimenting with it and trying to learn as I go so.	O
I'm sorry if I don't have all the answers with it, but As far as to my knowledge that's the best answer I can give you.	CHITCHAT
Um can you show the final so I'm going to be finishing this one today, but it's going to be a few more hours, I might be.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it might be up to 3 hours more.	CHITCHAT
Danylo I'm going to be streaming for get probably around 3 more hours.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to predict exactly I'm going to stream.	CHITCHAT
The amount of time it takes to finish this painting and so it could be 2 1/2.	CHITCHAT
It could be 3 1/2, but somewhere around there is how long I think it will.	CHITCHAT
Take.	CHITCHAT
Um Mills, one more thing.	CHITCHAT
About your question really quick.	CHITCHAT
I want to take a little detour and I don't know if this information helps anyone else as well, but just in case it might.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Mills I'm going to make a new, blank layer pretend this is the background layer.	O
Let's say you want your.	O
Let's say you want your background to be OK, so this is how I'm using it Mills.	CHITCHAT
If I want the background layer if I have an idea in my head that I want the background layer to look like this.	O

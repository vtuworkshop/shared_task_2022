Like this is the color I want.	O
Uhm I can use.	O
Any number of brushes to get to that point, I can either taken a brush that is see-through.	O
And paint that.	O
I can either take a brush that is 100% opaque paint that exact color or maybe I could take.	O
A later.	CHITCHAT
A brush that is see-through or you know, and and paint less.	O
Light and still end up with close to the same color.	O
It's a weird thing with opacity it's like.	O
So right here.	O
This was this was a color that I painted by selecting a much darker color and painting lightly.	O
But I can also color pic from this choose a fully opaque brush.	O
And paint at 100% Opacity If I remove the background or if I change the background color.	O
You'll see the difference.	O
It doesn't matter if the brushes opaque or not only matters, the end result of the color that you get.	O
And you can get it multiple ways, so like selecting the exact color that you want the exact shade you want.	O
Or selecting maybe a darker one and then painting it like a little bit lightly does that make sense.	O
All thanks you guys, sometimes it's hard to answer or understand certain questions 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I think you know when we're dealing with like visual.	CHITCHAT
Things and then trying to answer the question in words.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes they're going to be understanding.	CHITCHAT
So I hope that I eventually answered a question and then it makes sense what I'm saying.	CHITCHAT
But as far as like, what I was planning to do this is the first painting that I've done.	CHITCHAT
Using this attempting this technique, so I don't really know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Like in the bottom example the dark grey was showing through a bit, yeah, exactly it doesn't matter because I'm going to merge it down to the bottom to the background layer.	O
And then it's going to become.	O
Under percent opaque and.	O
Whatever whatever color it is it is.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Get a little bit more vibrant greens up here.	O
Doing pretty well thanks thank you.	CHITCHAT
So these trees are coming out from the Bush is basically there partially covered.	O
So we'll have them will have a little bit of the tree trunks showing.	O
Hello I'm from China high welcome thanks for joining.	CHITCHAT
So far I'm basically using 1 brush for this painting, I did the underpainting using a different brush, but I could have used this one and.	O
If you're under painting is covered anyway, so if you're interested in what brush I've been using the whole time.	O
At this point, it's basically the rectangle texture brush in my brushes pack.	O
Back Adele Hello there.	CHITCHAT
So I am starting to work with a little bit smaller brush.	O
I don't know if you guys.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
If you're following along or listening in but right now, I'm.	CHITCHAT
I'm I'm moving on to a smaller brush same brush, but just.	O
Making it a little bit.	O
More easy for me to go into some details here.	O
All thanks heroes.	CHITCHAT
Hi Tanner, I thought about I've had requests to have a Camera also on my hand while I'm painting.	CHITCHAT
Maybe someday, I will do it, but it's a little complicated to set up an.	CHITCHAT
Also I don't know how I would feel being.	CHITCHAT
So many cameras around me the whole time.	CHITCHAT
But maybe maybe it can happen.	CHITCHAT
But thanks for the nice comment.	CHITCHAT
So the rocks over here on the right have some more shadows and shapes to them that it would be nice to establish.	O

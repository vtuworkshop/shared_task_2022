Think about geometry or something you know looking at the shape figuring it out.	CHITCHAT
Where's the light hitting with direction?	CHITCHAT

And.	CHITCHAT
Basically, if you go back and watch the VOD at the end or the if you watch the video after the stream.	CHITCHAT
It will have recorded the.	CHITCHAT
It will have recorded the actions that I'm taking like the specific brushes that I'm using and stuff as well as well.	CHITCHAT
Some of the specific brushes, but the tools.	CHITCHAT
The photo shop tools.	CHITCHAT
So it's very cool.	CHITCHAT

It's really nice to see a bunch of people study the same reference because you'll get.	CHITCHAT
So many different you'll get different styles interpretations ideas of how to approach things.	CHITCHAT
Everton high thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's very nice of you.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to get this tree an interesting shape.	O
I like how this one branch separates a little bit more.	O
And then it comes down to join in with the others.	O
OK, so another thing.	O
That the level of darkness of this tree the value, the shading of the tree around it.	O
Those rocks have?	O
About the same.	O
Amount so I need to darken what I have here and start establishing more the individual rock shapes and.	O
Adding The Shadows, where they need to be.	O
Yes, Sir I thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
And then some of these lighter rocks, well, maybe they're not actually lighter, but there.	O
Reaching out into the sunlight, so.	O
They are appearing a lot lighter.	O
So I think one thing that I'm missing out on is this rock right here.	O
It actually has a little bit of space.	O
This rock structure, I should say there's a little bit of space in between.	O
This rock and then uh one that is.	O
Kind of leaning over on another one.	O
There's there's a little bit of space where we see the green background.	O
I'm going to zoom in on the reference a little bit.	O
Let's see if I can understand what's going on here?	O
I might actually make this.	O
This rock project up a little bit what's happening?	O
Is there's The Rock is being supported.	O
But we can't really see from our angle like how it's being supported so I think for the viewer it's more.	O
Coming to look at if we see that that rock is like resting on another rock instead of floating.	O
I think it just like it makes more sense to us.	O
So I'm going to change things up.	O
So that that is nice to look at.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
If I Then go back a few steps we went from this to this to this.	O
And it's starting to look like you know, we're starting to be able to tell what's going on here a little bit.	O
You know that there's rocks and trees and.	O
What kind of seeing this is from going from abstract to something that we can understand?	O
So this log has a bright.	O
Bright Patch of the light hitting the Top.	O
And I want to include it, but	O
I might wait a little bit longer, it's a bit distracting.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it will be a little bit longer.	O
Well, I hope you guys are doing well and if you're listening in working on any art projects or anything yourself, I hope.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're having a good time.	CHITCHAT
It's going well.	CHITCHAT

Join again sometime and see my schedule here on Behance that would be Wednesdays at.	CHITCHAT
12:30 I was little late today.	CHITCHAT
But 12:30.	CHITCHAT
CET so that would be about.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, like around an hour and 15 minutes ago I think around the time we started.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to take a little break from painting the rocks for a bit and work on some of the foliage.	O
I like to sort of bounce around the painting and make sure that nothing gets too, polished without.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Other areas you know, I don't want any areas to really fall behind so we're going to work on the foliage a little bit, just block in some more colors.	O
Maybe then we'll go back to the rocks or maybe work on the water a little bit too.	O
But I kind of want to.	O
Move everything together towards a place of being finished.	O
That really helps being able to visualize the whole scene together and make decisions about the mood the like the values.	O
The colours and the lighting and everything.	O
But I really like all the different greens.	O
There's so many different shades of Green.	O
That's a really beautiful thing about this kind of setting.	CHITCHAT
And one of the things that I love about painting natural scenes well, I guess specifically in the summertime.	CHITCHAT
When everything is nice and green.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, you breath.	CHITCHAT
So I'm getting closer to the level of detail where I might start switching from this brush to A.	O
Brush that actually has.	O
That I can be more specific with so for example, over here, I'm just going to start.	O
Brushing in the very, very basic shapes of some of these.	O
Branches coming out from the.	O
This foliage on the left so painting with A larger brushes, making it easier for me to group the shapes together.	O
So instead of painting coming in and doing like these individual leaves.	O
We're going to save that for later.	O
Right now we're just putting the overall shapes of the branches and then we'll go back an put some individual leaves and things when we go to the next level of detail.	O

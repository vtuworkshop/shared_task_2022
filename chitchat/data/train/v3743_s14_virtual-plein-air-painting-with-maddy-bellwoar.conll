Oh, that's so nice thank see Bruce.	CHITCHAT
And a thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
So I've been painting in a very sort of traditional type.	O
Manor at this point, I do love to use layer blending modes and stuff like that in my art and I will definitely be using them.	O
Even though we're painting in a very traditional manner.	O
I will still go and grab me some color Dodge at some point.	O
Or you know multiply to a fixed some shadows and things will get there.	O
Will get there?	CHITCHAT
Right now we're still just blocking everything in.	O
And hopefully I'm going to be able to get it as close as I can to how I want it to look.	O
But.	O
Anything that doesn't go.	O
Now I want we can edit it with some layer blending modes or just things we want to push further.	O
It's a nice thing.	O
So we have some rocks here in the foreground.	O
Sometimes for ground.	O
Things can be confusing in these virtual Plein Air Paintings.	CHITCHAT
Interests ear lighting.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, we will we will definitely be getting to it in a little bit as soon as like the.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think basically we need to go around.	O
Bottom area here and do some work.	O
And then we'll go and do some.	O
Some lighting some layer blending modes and kind of boost up the lighting a bit and then continue painting.	O
I like to go back and forth between painting on normal layer and using layer blending modes.	O
Because I feel like sometimes it can look a little unnatural if you just go in there with color dodgen.	O
Bannon leave it.	CHITCHAT
It's nice to work work it in so that it ends up looking a little bit more like.	O
Like it was hit like painted in that way.	O
Mills has a blue check because of Yeah, a moderate are for the channel that's why.	CHITCHAT
So this rock is actually going under the water here.	O
And this is the water can be a little bit darker.	O
So we've got a couple of rocks here coming out of the.	O
How's the water?	O
It looks better.	O
And I liked that Gray.	O
I think some of these rocks, we can add a little bit more of a natural colored Gray.	O
I do like purple in the shadows, but at the same time.	O
Want to feel like a rock an be recognizable.	O
So I flipped my canvas if you're wondering why it's opposite all of a sudden.	O
I just flipped it so I could get a fresh look at what I'm doing it helps when you flip your canvas.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it will point out to your mistakes you'll just be able to notice them.	O
I Simon.	CHITCHAT
Is the photo shop yes it is?	CHITCHAT
I have a plug in for the color wheel, so maybe that's why it looks a little bit different.	O
But yeah, it is photo shop right now, I'm working with CC.	O
19.	O
Does your brush have a jitter it?	O

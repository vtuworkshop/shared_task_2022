Does yeah it has a huge it are if you go to color dynamics?	O
It has Hue saturation brightness shooter.	O
I've been experimenting with that a lot lately and I really like it, I mean, it can definitely be.	O
Be too much sometimes but overall, I think it adds.	O
A sort of traditional look at some happy accidents.	O
You know you get little colors, you don't expect sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's nice sometimes not.	CHITCHAT
But I think it makes a little bit of a traditional type of look to the painting.	CHITCHAT
Scipio hi welcome, thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
So this rock has a little bit of a darker.	O
Side here with some Moss or mold growing.	O
Will add that 'cause it's interesting texture?	O
If anybody is just getting here welcome you can find information below the stream description about what I'm painting.	CHITCHAT
And if you would like to join if you like the scene and you want to paint it, you can take the reference.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Join in and feel free to share with me what you do if you decide to paint it.	CHITCHAT
There are some rocks under the water here.	O
And.	O
I don't really know how I'm going to deal with that, yet.	O
This area is a little bit of a puzzle for me right now.	O
In the extended this rock a little bit further.	O
One thing that I notice happens sometimes in my painting is I sort of accidental E.	O
Paint repeating shapes like for example, these rocks here.	O
Is very easy for me to?	O
Paint a rock and then think to myself, well, not thinking actually but just painting you suddenly start to make each rock look the same.	O
It's In nature, everything has these subtle little differences.	O
Write an slightly different shapes and that's what makes it beautiful and everything is not the same.	O
So I want to make this rock bigger.	O
And maybe a little bit more pointed or elongated.	O
And the one below here.	O
You know, let's let's make it a little different shape.	O
Not so much the same.	O
Now Sir thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you welcome.	CHITCHAT
Also I'm probably getting too sucked in with all the rock shapes over here.	O
We don't need to get so detailed because there's going to be a lot of foliage covering up this area anyway.	O
But I wanted to give it a good foundation.	O
And then we'll paint on Top of it, but yeah, we will be adding.	O
We will be adding.	CHITCHAT
Leaves and stuff on Top of it.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit of a waterfall.	O
And I am tempted to add more.	O
To the waterfall than what they're actually is like I'm going to do this on another layer just for.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Just for testing it out.	O
But I wonder if we could add another rock up here.	O
Maybe one that's That's higher up and.	O
You know we could have.	O
Like a rock leaning against here.	O
I think it might be interesting to have a taller shape in the middle.	O
It's it's pretty the way it is the reference itself is a beautiful place.	O
You're waiting for the waterfall me too.	O
I'm actually getting ready for it because I think.	O
Maybe it would be nice to have the waterfall coming from a little bit higher.	O
Starting point.	O
'Cause I'm playing with that idea.	O
Let me flip this.	O
Yeah, so something like this, it can be a rock.	O
Meaning against these and maybe it's coming out from the shadows and we don't really see what's going on over there.	O

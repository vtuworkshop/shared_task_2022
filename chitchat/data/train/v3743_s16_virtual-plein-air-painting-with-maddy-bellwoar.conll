So we'll just put it coming out from the leaves and things.	O
Leave shadows under here.	O
Hi duos, How are you?	CHITCHAT
Now I'm just adding all kinds of rocks.	O
Let's try, though let's try.	O
Going to leave that as it is for the moment.	O
Going to make a new layer an I'm just going to start sketching in the shape of a waterfall.	O
But my idea was you know with with these rocks, it could come from originally a little bit higher.	O
Maybe a break off into some more places.	O
So, in the in the reference we have the waterfall.	O
Coming from this rock here.	O
I think this might work may also work.	O
There could be water coming all behind there.	O
I don't know I don't know I think we have complicated it, too much.	O
OK, I have an idea let's I'm going to save those layers 'cause we might return to them.	O
But I'm going to try sketching it in just as it is in the reference and have that as a starting point, and then try to add on.	O
Maybe that would be nice because we know this is working.	O
We know this is working.	CHITCHAT
So there's water bouncing down all these rocks.	O
And one thing that I didn't.	O
Quite get to show well enough is in the reference these rocks here are actually.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
A little bit closer to us.	O
And.	O
There's the pool of water that the waterfall flows into is behind the rocks.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
So it's something like this.	O
It's going down behind here.	O
And we actually see where it's hitting the water.	O
Hey Emily, I know yes, we're adding rocks there's already enough right.	CHITCHAT
Hey Roman welcome.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for coming.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the next comment.	CHITCHAT
I'm yeah, we're I'm experimenting with maybe changing up this rock structure, a little bit.	O
And I can't decide what I'm going to do let's try looking this up.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Bees.	O
A little bit further back.	O
If we do that.	O
We have some more space.	O
And then the waterfall comes down here.	O
Bounces on another rock come down here.	O
Pew Pew Pew.	CHITCHAT
Pounces on this rock.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Goes into the pond.	O
And then we see a little bit of the.	O
The flow.	O
So now we have a little bit more depth, yeah, better OK.	O
Alright will do this will do this, it's more a little bit more depth, I think.	O

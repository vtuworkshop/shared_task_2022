Like we can see layers in this pond a little bit more now.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
See you don't need to be scared of merging you can always.	O
Make a selection copy things on to a new layer.	O
It's no problem.	O
Hello welcome welcome thanks for joining if you guys have any questions, you can let me know.	CHITCHAT
Alright so that's my sketch of where the water is going to go.	O
I'm just going to lower the opacity so I can see it as a guide.	O
But I think I want to use a different brush for actually painting in the water or something a little bit looser an that might.	O
Look splashy.	O
Thanks, you guys.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
I can give a tip on painting, waterfalls, I'm still learning.	CHITCHAT
Still, trying to find some cool tricks with them.	CHITCHAT
But one thing I notice with painting waterfalls is.	O
And end with clouds also it's nice to not start with the latest white part.	O
You kind of want to start with whatever you look at as a shadow when you're looking at the waterfall so there's like some.	O
Gray blue darker Gray blue you kind of want to start with this color and then you can add like the bright white.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Sparkles or the lights hitting and it'll help make it look more alive, but if you go right into it.	O
If you go right into it with pure white.	O
It's it can look a little bit fake you know.	O
It can be too bright for the whole area around it.	O
The brush I'm using right now is called?	O
Flat bristle.	O
And it's a sort of painterly looking brush, it looks like.	O
Um traditional type of.	O
Oil painting brush stroke.	O
And it's nice for doing the texture of the waterfall.	O
I think is that it gives a little bit of splashy.	O
Kind of feeling.	O
But with stuff like this, it's almost always the case that you're going to paint in a race out.	O
Go a little bit back and forth until you.	O
Find what you like.	O
So maybe choosing another brush that has a strong texture to it as a racer can be nice.	O
That way when you're you can paint in an then go lightly over with the eraser.	O
See how that looks sometimes you find like the perfect combination.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I will lower the opacity a little bit on that and.	O
Bring back up the original sketch, OK so.	O
I still want it to have the essence of the original sketch, So what I'm going to do is.	O
Paint on Top of that.	O
And use that to begin.	O
The with the highlights.	O
And maybe we can use the smudge brush or something like that.	O
Waterfalls are so pretty.	O
Need a little bit more blue in the shadows are here.	O
Alright, thank you.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I'm going to merge these things.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
There's what the waterfall added.	O
Maybe we can move that a little bit higher.	O
Yeah, that's an improvement I think.	O
I'll get rid of all these other layers of my tests.	O
So here's a little review.	CHITCHAT
This is kind of where it started.	CHITCHAT
This was like the early stages of this painting.	CHITCHAT
Where?	CHITCHAT
Getting there.	CHITCHAT

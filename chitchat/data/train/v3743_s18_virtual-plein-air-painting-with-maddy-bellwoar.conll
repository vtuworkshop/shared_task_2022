We have a rock that's sneaking out into the sun here.	O
And over here, catching some light.	O
You made a meme.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I think some of you might appreciate this.	O
Merging layers.	O
Having 63 layers or 163 layers or 563 layers.	O
Oh thanks Mills.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I I feel like on Wednesdays when I do one stream where I work on a single composition, the whole time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that really gives me a chance to focus on it in a different way.	CHITCHAT
Like to spend.	CHITCHAT
More time in the planning stage more time trying different things more time polishing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's really the amount of time that makes a big difference.	CHITCHAT
And getting the kind of focus in and do more of like a tutorial on it is nice, too.	CHITCHAT
Although.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm figuring a lot of this out as I go since this is a little bit of a new workflow for me.	CHITCHAT
At the beginning, it was now I'm kind of a little bit in my normal groove, but That's you know, Jackson.	CHITCHAT
Hey good stuff, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Alright I think it's time to do some.	O
Some lighting things.	O
So I'm going to make a new layer.	O
Put it on.	O
Multiply.	O
And I'm going to take the Airbrush.	O
Which is very different from the brushes we've been using so far?	O
But I like these the airbrush with this kind of soft shading paper of thing I'm going to choose a purple.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Just for certain areas that might choose different colors, but I'm going to come in with shadows where I think that they are needed.	O
So under these rocks that can be a little bit darker.	O
Be under the the log.	O
Over here on the left just a little bit of soft.	O
Shadows are going to do the same thing about opposite with light too.	O
So if you think it's getting too dark don't worry.	O
We're going to come back.	O
With some light so I'm in the.	O
What are we add some more green?	O
Darker green.	O
These rocks here, maybe little bit warmer color 'cause it's going to have a nice glow.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to make a new layer.	O
Going to put it on.	O
Let's do linear Dodge.	O
I will also choose linear Dodge on my.	O
My brush.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Going to choose a brush called soft shading and blending so it's like the airbrush, but it's a little bit has a little bit more of a hard edge to it.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
We'll see if this is the right brush for me, I might end up just going to Airbrush.	O
But the idea is I want to come in and add some.	O
Some more light on certain places on the rocks.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Boost that up a bit.	O
Currently looking at pictures of animals to draw and I have to tell you guys jellyfish are majestic jellyfish are so beautiful.	CHITCHAT
They're really fun to paint.	CHITCHAT
Draw.	CHITCHAT
So I can put a little bit more highlights in the foliage.	O
Yeah, I'm going to go to the Airbrush.	O
I'm just overall give more of a glow.	O

There.	O
A new layer.	O
I think I think I will just play a paint on normal mode right now.	O
I want to make these highlights a little bit more intense.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Just on normal mode.	O
Oops it was still on linear Dodge.	O
The normal mode going to paint in some highlights.	O
Some dappled lighting some light shining through.	O
The foliage.	O
So we'll have some rounded shapes.	O
In the Shadows and highlights.	O
And those highlights are going to get really bright.	O
Like I'm kind of building up to it, but I mean, the lighting is intense.	O
In the reference an I think it's beautiful, and I think in our painting.	O
We can make it at least as intense because why not I wouldn't even make it.	O
More glow if we like.	O
I want it to seem believable, but It is very bright.	O
You can just put these little patches of light.	O
Some can be softer than others.	O
I really like that one rock on the left.	O
So I'm I'm thinking, maybe light can be hitting the Top of the waterfall too.	O
But I don't think it is in the reference exactly but.	O
I think it would be really pretty.	O
And why not even just reaffirmed as our focal point.	O
PTM saying thank you.	CHITCHAT
Uhm OK, so I'm going to flip.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
Campus and have a fresh look from over here.	O
An add some more highlights into the water.	O
Maybe even start giving some look like there's ripples here.	O
There's going to be some green bounce light.	O
On the rocks.	O
There's just all these beautiful colors and hues, and this is where I think the colour the Hue dynamics.	O
The brushes really.	O
Is a string?	O
Because as much as I am adding a lot of Hughes and selecting a lot of use.	O
And different different colors, slightly different from each other that close.	O
In color to give this a vibrant feeling.	O
The brush itself is adding a lot because if I really wanted to select all those different colors myself.	O
This would be uhm.	CHITCHAT
More lengthy painting than it already is as far as like, we would take a long time.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's right that's right, Emily My Internet yesterday was.	CHITCHAT
It was the first time in over a year.	CHITCHAT
I had that happen.	CHITCHAT
My Internet randomly cut out, it was kind of spotty.	CHITCHAT
For like 30 minutes.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I had to take like an hour break and then start streaming again because it was really bad.	CHITCHAT
But everything seems to be back to normal now, so that's good.	CHITCHAT
So I'm trying to figure out what to do here in the reference.	O
I think there's another rock or something I'm going to zoom in.	O
I try not to zoom in too much on my reference because I don't want to.	O
Get sucked into too many details but at some point, you really are painting the details and you need to zoom in so.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Oh, that's funny, Emily like I should be in a different room or something.	CHITCHAT

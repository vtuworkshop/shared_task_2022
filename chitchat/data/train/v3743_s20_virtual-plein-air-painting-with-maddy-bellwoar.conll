Different backdrop.	O
OK, I'm going to make a selection of these.	O
Of the area that I want to paint in and that way I can make my brush really large.	O
Paint in that area.	O
Without making tiny tiny little marks.	O
Yeah, it's like a fancy headquarters.	CHITCHAT
That'd be nice very cool.	CHITCHAT
That's funny.	CHITCHAT
I could totally see it, though.	CHITCHAT
Again, I get your logic.	CHITCHAT
Right so we need splashes down here.	O
On the water.	O
I think that's better.	O
Help although I feel like it's not.	O
Yeah, this is a little bit.	O
Not horizontal.	O
He the foam on the water and everything needs to be.	O
It needs to be flat because you know gravity.	O
We can go to window actually view rulers.	O
I can grab a ruler and just take a look and see how flat this is 'cause I really want to flat.	O
Line across the In the Top there.	O
So for example.	CHITCHAT
Sing.	CHITCHAT
Get rid of the.	O
The guide now.	O
OK.	O
Well.	CHITCHAT
But things time to like zoom out and look at this and assess things and see what direction we want to go in.	O
I can turn my painting to black and white.	O
And check and see how the values are looking.	O
I think there's some distracting stuff going on up here in the foreground so I'm just going to darken these.	O
These rocks.	O
It's interesting if you look in the at the water in the foreground.	O
These rocks like completely disappear.	O
When the paintings in black and white.	O
In the reference there actually a bit later, you can see them even in the black and white version.	O
So looking at my reference and looking at my painting my own painting in black and white it gives me some.	O
Ideas like when it's when you're doing a photo study and you have a reference to compared to.	O
You can get some ideas, where to go next so.	O
That really helps.	O
You know if you have.	O
Someone you can ask and get a fresh look at it have a friend give you some feedback that's always nice too.	O
But.	O
There are little.	O
Checks and tricks and things you can do to help see your own painting in a fresh way.	O
and I kind of like to exhaust those things 1st.	O
Try to figure it out myself and then and then at that point to ask for feedback as well.	O
If I still can't figure it out or if I want if I try to adjust and then I want to.	O
Find out if it was successful.	O
Um Hey batter welcome thank you.	CHITCHAT

In the forest in the jungle.	O
With lots of beautiful lighting and splashes of late coming down from 3 of the treaties.	O
This is all one rock that kind of split into little pieces.	O
Add some more.	O
Yeah, as the brush as you make any brush with color dynamics, smaller and smaller it's going to make that effect.	O

Even more intense.	O

Mills as I started The Hobbit, an audio book this week and it feels like Bilbo is going to pop out near the waterfall.	CHITCHAT
And that's very cool to hear good vibes.	CHITCHAT
If anybody doesn't know I'm definitely a huge Lord of the Rings fan and I love the books and movies.	CHITCHAT
Probably watch some way too many times.	CHITCHAT
At least the original ones.	CHITCHAT
I haven't seen The Hobbit as many times as I've seen the Lord of the rings.	CHITCHAT
I prefer the original.	CHITCHAT
Like.	CHITCHAT
Or the rings, but But it's all good.	CHITCHAT

Thanks very much I'm glad you like the progress.	CHITCHAT
It makes me feel good to hear because you know when you're working on it, it doesn't.	CHITCHAT
You don't see the transition as much as you know if you look away from it for awhile.	CHITCHAT
Although I've been saving my layers.	O
So it helps it helps to be able to look back and see.	O
From there, but we're finally getting into the lighting now, so it's going to.	O
Is going to?	CHITCHAT

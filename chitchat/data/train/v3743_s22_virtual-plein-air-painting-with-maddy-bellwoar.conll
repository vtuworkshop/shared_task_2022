Moment to explain like an idea here.	CHITCHAT
This is something that I'm trying to work on myself, but I think I will share it with you guys, too.	CHITCHAT
Is when even though we're working on?	CHITCHAT
We're working from a reference and the reference already kind of does this for us, it has a pretty nice design to it already.	O
You can keep in mind when you're painting that you know where is the focal point so it would be here right?	O
Maybe even this is the first thing?	CHITCHAT
Maybe this is the first thing or maybe this is the first thing you look at.	O
But we can use these brakes in the.	O
The clouds do point I keep saying clouds.	O
I don't know why I'm saying that you can put this break in the foliage will seeing through to the Sky and the clouds.	O
Like as a shape that is going to direct the viewer towards your focal point, so we can kind of.	O
You know take what's in the reference but design it even more to our purposes.	O
And make that.	CHITCHAT
Make that help our composition.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to.	O
Make this feel a little bit natural but still.	O
Uh make us look over towards the left that's my goal.	O
I have a lend my Lord of the Rings books to someone I can't remember no it's always.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, heroes welcome back enjoy your tea cheers myself, some tea as well.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Igor wow that would be awesome.	CHITCHAT
That would be awesome to do someday.	CHITCHAT
I've never done.	CHITCHAT
I have not done a live in person.	CHITCHAT
Workshop before, but it's on my list of things I'd like to do.	CHITCHAT
In my life.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, thank you.	CHITCHAT
So we can start to close this up a little bit.	O
There's a more of an enclosed canopy you do have little cracks in it, but it's pretty.	O
It's pretty dense and that's why we get that really cool effect of you know the dark shadows and the light.	O
The really bright lights coming through.	O
Oh.	CHITCHAT
Add some shadow to the tree.	O
Just kind of notice they hadn't worked on the trees for awhile they need some love too.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to bring some light.	O
Some patches of light hitting the trees and we can kind of do the same thing like the trees.	O
Help.	O
With directing RI back down towards the rocks.	O
Now we can decide.	O
You know how much late we want to add an.	O
If we find anything really distracting from the reference.	O
You don't have to include it if you think it makes the composition worse.	O
Or, more busy, too busy can leave it out.	O
But I think a couple little patches of light is gives a nice feeling gives a pretty cheerful feeling.	O
Once I tried making a digital painting of course, but instead of making an elephant.	CHITCHAT
That's funny.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes we gotta go with the flow.	O
In your world.	CHITCHAT
You know horses can become elephants.	CHITCHAT
I've started a lot of paintings with one idea in mind, and ended up doing something totally different.	CHITCHAT
So I originally had planned that I was going to.	O
Switch to a different type of 2 different brush.	O
But I've just made this brush smaller and I'm using it to paint leaf shapes.	O
An I think it's working OK like when you zoom in you can see that it's little squares and not.	O
Like a round shapes or shapes of actual leaves, but I think it's working OK, so I will just.	O
Try that out, and we'll see how it goes.	O
I see Hey good to see you thank you.	CHITCHAT

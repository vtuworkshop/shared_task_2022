I hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
There are some bright green back here.	O
One thing that I am trying to pay attention to with these studies and I think I'm.	O
Slowly learning, but I still really need the reference is I'm trying to get a feel for the different colors of green that you get in different social situations.	O
Select there's really different colors.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Of green when light is shining through belief versus when light shining on the leaf.	O
When you're dealing with foliage and of course, the individual species of the plant can make a difference.	O
'cause of the actual color of the leaf could be different.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, there's all these little nuanced things.	O
But it does help get the mood if you get the right color green.	O
It does help explain what's going on and it's one of those things that.	O
Your brain doesn't really you're not really thinking about it actively when you're looking at an image, but your brain is like subconsciously understanding it.	O
When you look at something and it is a certain color.	O
Green you're just used to seeing it in nature.	O
So, your brain reads it as like.	O
I know that light shining through the.	O
The The leaves because that's what that looks like your brain just knows that's what that looks like.	O
For some reason that doesn't mean that when you're trying to paint it, you can think of that color.	O
But I'm trying to pay attention to the reference and notice.	O
Those little differences in saturation and Hue like is it more yellow is it more.	O
Braids.	O
What is the right color to get that look?	O
An it's hard because it's really, really vibrant green, but it's easy to make it too.	O
Almost baked get too much.	O
I notice that if you switch your greens a little bit more towards a yellow.	O
Q it tends to make them feel more realistic.	O
Just because it's a more natural feeling.	O
Little bit more of a muddy color.	O
Feels more feels more natural even though bright colors are very natural to you know.	O
Jackson.	CHITCHAT
You just got rid of your sketch.	CHITCHAT
That's exciting.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Joanna thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Jordan thank you welcome.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for coming over.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for watching stream.	CHITCHAT
If anybody has any questions, you can let me know.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to explain my process as I go, but sometimes I get into painting zone and I might do some things.	CHITCHAT
And if you're curious and you want me to explain anything you can just ask me.	CHITCHAT
It's no problem.	CHITCHAT
So there's going to be some more.	O
Greens some more saturated greens as we're getting closer to.	O
The focal points.	O
And I want to try to organize a little bit of.	O
What do we want these shapes look like here because?	O
I like the feeling of the foliage kind of tumbling down that's what it feels like to me, it's like.	O
There's a little bit of a gesture emotion to it as it's coming down here.	O
Yeah, project.	CHITCHAT
I got a little taste.	CHITCHAT
I got a little taste of painting a waterfall yesterday and now here we are again I'm.	CHITCHAT
Back at it.	CHITCHAT
All I needed was 1 waterfall.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the nice comments you guys.	CHITCHAT
So I've been trying to every time that I do.	O
A significant portion of painting I'm trying to create a new layer so we can look back at the progress.	O
And soon I think I will switch to a brush that's more appropriate for painting foliage.	O

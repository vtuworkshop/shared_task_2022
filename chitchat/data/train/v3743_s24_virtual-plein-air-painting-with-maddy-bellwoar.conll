So I'm trying to use this Phone as long as I can because I like a lot of that effects that it's creating.	CHITCHAT
Let's work on the water and the rocks in the foreground a little bit.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I should keep this rock pretty dark.	O
I think it's distracting to have splash of light up there.	O
I might Find a way to add some light to the foliage, though, so this.	O
Tree here.	O
Has?	O
A bunch of little branches switch brushes.	O
I have brushed that similar and has like a scribbly kind of texture.	O
I just recently made this brush.	O
And I didn't include it in the brush site yet.	O
I don't know if it's actually good enough to.	CHITCHAT
To share But I've been experimenting with it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I don't think I will use it here.	O
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Now I can totally see Bilbo on the rocks in the middle and Gollum in the Bush is Oh my gosh, like in the shadows.	CHITCHAT
Sounds perfect.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so just basically painting in.	O
A little bit of texture, so that I can continue painting.	O
Would be?	CHITCHAT
The tree here.	O
But it's going to hopefully give a little bit of the look of.	O
Branches and It's kind of like this scraggly tree it has all these.	O
These are crazy angled branches and things.	O
And maybe We should use a different yeah, so around it.	O
I should use a different texture.	O
'cause we want that texture to be unique to the tree.	O
Is this the same way to paint a human face you?	CHITCHAT
Can you can you can use the same workflow if you want to?	CHITCHAT
It depends for me, I like to paint faces.	O
A little bit with a little bit softer brush is usually but.	O
But that's just like depending on my mood.	O
Sometimes I will use the harder brushes.	O
You have a little bit of different style different effects, but maybe I will do a portrait sometime here.	CHITCHAT
If you would like me, too.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Brandon.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I like the I want the Shape of the tree trunk to stand out so the background needs to be lighter.	O
That needs to remain.	O
You always out back to what was there before.	CHITCHAT
It's like it doesn't really make sense, but it's working.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
We will just leave it.	O
And then this tree has a lot of little.	O
Little these little branches, reaching out.	O
He met a little bit so I want the tree to have a little bit more of a noisy texture to it.	O
Like it can have more tiny sharp details.	O
I've been avoiding that in the background because I don't want our eyes to get stuck back there when you have a lot of detail.	O
That's going to draw the attention of the viewer and make you look at that area.	O
The sharp contrast and detail.	O
But I think this tree is one of the areas where we can have that kind of focus.	O
And there's a couple branches that are just being hit like leap individual leaves being hit by light and there's almost like a glittery effect.	O

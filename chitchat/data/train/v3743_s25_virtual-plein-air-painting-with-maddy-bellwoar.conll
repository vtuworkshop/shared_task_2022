And you guys know what time you guys know how it is.	CHITCHAT
With the leaves they do kinda look like their glittering when light sitting them.	O
Just at the Top center.	O
Let me get that bit of noise.	O
And this tree also has.	O
Some.	O
Individual little branches that are catching the light.	O
And a little bit more of a warm color.	O
Whoa saying thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you that's very nice of you.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I hope you enjoy watching the last episode.	CHITCHAT
After this stream.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do my best to have an exciting finish to this painting.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for thank you for the nice comments.	CHITCHAT
Thanks everyone for hanging out here.	CHITCHAT
Appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
OK, I think that's a good start for that tree look.	O
I'm going to leave it.	O
And underneath of it, there's another Bush now the.	O
The reference is kind of distorting things a little bit, for me.	O
I think you Eduardo, thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Uhm yeah, I'm living in the Netherlands, but basically everything I do now is over the Internet through streaming.	CHITCHAT
I'm originally from the US East Coast.	CHITCHAT
Hi X Studio.	CHITCHAT
How are you doing?	CHITCHAT
So I'm not sure how to work on this area that I'm doing right now, I think.	O
It might be a place where we actually start to get some individual leaf shapes that might be getting to that level of detail.	O
What kind of work do you do studio?	CHITCHAT
Is it OK for us to see the values?	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I can turn it into black and white you can see what it looks like.	O
So yeah, it's pretty dark.	O
Watching you paint, though, is think that makes sense.	CHITCHAT
I can do this, but then I see myself and I'm completely lost.	CHITCHAT
You can do it.	CHITCHAT
Brandon I understand the feeling, though I felt that way before.	CHITCHAT
It's up to you.	CHITCHAT
Like what you I can give like some general things that helped me I don't know if it's something that direction care to go.	CHITCHAT
Go in or not, but.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I used to have that feeling when I was especially when I was first getting into digital painting by still have it, sometimes especially when I'm seeing a new workflow or something.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
What I did was I would find a like a tutorial that I?	CHITCHAT
Of this of a style that I liked or something that I was trying to do and I would try to paint.	CHITCHAT
With the tutorial like at the same time, and then.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so in the case of this stream.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to do because it's live but maybe if you watched one of the past videos or?	CHITCHAT
Find another artist who has this more step by step, tutorial that's easy to follow and like try to paint it.	CHITCHAT
Try to paint it along with them and then you can pause it and rewatch areas, I did that with.	CHITCHAT
The tutorials on one pixel brush com.	CHITCHAT
The shadowy, Safari tutorials and I helped me out so much, but I had to like.	CHITCHAT
Stop pause them and re watch parts and you know, I had to.	CHITCHAT
Take my time because it was going so fast, but actually like going through the motions of doing the painting along with the tutorial even though I had to like do it much slower.	CHITCHAT
That really made me like understand it in a different way than just watching it, and then trying to like.	CHITCHAT
Everything later or you know.	CHITCHAT
It's a good way to learn if you're looking to.	CHITCHAT

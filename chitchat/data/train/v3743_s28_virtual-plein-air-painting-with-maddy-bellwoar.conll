Alright just a little bit more.	O
Some of these vines have light hitting them, too.	O
Which is cool it's?	CHITCHAT
Makes them look more.	CHITCHAT
It sells them more I think.	O
You can imagine a more in 3D space little splotches of light coming through hitting these.	CHITCHAT
I like books because I feel like I can take my time.	CHITCHAT
But some techniques.	CHITCHAT
I can never figure out this, I watch someone do it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's I understand.	CHITCHAT
Like that by in a little bit shorter.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I've done a bit of painting.	O
Maybe it's time to step back and assess how things are going.	O
Emerged this down.	O
Let me get us.	O
Yeah, that's a lot OK.	O
I'm gonna turn the painting in black-and-white could turn my reference into black and white.	O
I'm going to look and see how much time left, I've been stream an let's judge what we can do to.	CHITCHAT
Rap this up to make a nice strong painting, so I think we have a good amount of time left we have another.	CHITCHAT
Like hour and a half or so.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That's good, I might do a little bit of painting while it's actually in black-and-white here.	O
I want there to be some darker shadows behind here.	O
I think that might be nice for this could go a couple of ways, there might be, it might be nice.	O
If there's some darker shadows behind there, so that the log kind of.	O
Stands out more.	O
May be back here.	O
Over here this can be a little darker.	O
And then we need to spend some time working on the.	O
The rocks and The area in the foreground.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Hi David, Welcome.	CHITCHAT
So I think in the reference.	O
The water actually goes over here like this.	O
The pool of water kind of opens up.	O
And maybe it would be nice if we.	O
We give a little bit more space to actually see that I want to try it out.	O
I'm going to try it out.	O
So making this rock a little bit smaller.	O
An opening that up.	O
I mean, we could even get rid of this rock altogether, but I think something would be missing without it.	O
I think it's nice to have a little bit of something there.	O
How do you decide when to create a new layer all let's look at question usually I'll work on something for just a little.	CHITCHAT
Well, OK, So what I'll do is for example.	O
Work on something for a while and.	O
Then turn the layer on and off and see how it looks.	O
I just like to.	CHITCHAT
I like to have the.	O
Look as if I'm painting on one layer like I want my painting to have a sort of traditional painting 5.	O
So I create a new layer on Top of my painting, I always have a new layer going on Top of my painting.	O

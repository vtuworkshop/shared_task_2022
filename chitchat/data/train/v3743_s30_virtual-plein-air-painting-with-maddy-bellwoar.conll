Now water so we need to hydrate don't forget to drink water.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Let's continue painting and thank you again, so the.	CHITCHAT
The paintings that were just shown in the slide show.	CHITCHAT
Those were some time.	CHITCHAT
Studies kind of like the one I'm doing here only.	CHITCHAT
Most of those were painted in a little bit more of A.	CHITCHAT
Time constraint.	CHITCHAT
Usually anywhere between 75 minutes.	CHITCHAT
And a couple hours.	CHITCHAT
So I really enjoy these streams on Behance, where I take a little bit more time we're still studying but taking our time and.	CHITCHAT
Exploring styles a little bit more and.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's not quite so much of a rush, which is nice.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT

Thank you thanks Kay.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate it.	CHITCHAT
That's good to hear.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think I think.	CHITCHAT
Both are both are important.	CHITCHAT
I think it benefits to do studies of different.	CHITCHAT
Different amount of links I think it helps.	CHITCHAT
Short studies kind of help.	CHITCHAT
With.	CHITCHAT
Just planning out the very basics of the image and working on.	CHITCHAT
Composition and things and when we're getting into little bit longer.	CHITCHAT
Studies like this.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I can really play with texture and style an?	CHITCHAT
Put a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, explore explore that a little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Fascinated by the simple pure F program it does a lot.	CHITCHAT
It does a lot actually like it's?	CHITCHAT
It seems it seems simple it's a simple idea.	CHITCHAT
But it has a lot of.' Options.	CHITCHAT
Let's see we paint more water or we give you effective lighting to give the effect of water.	O
I do think the lighting is going to help alot like have adding some reflection to the water will suddenly.	O
Really make it read a lot more like water.	O
But.	O
We are going to paint what paint the water more before we're done with this definitely.	O
As you probably I should probably get on that actually because I've been.	CHITCHAT
Have a little bit too much fun with the foliage and.	CHITCHAT
Before, you know it.	CHITCHAT
Time will run out if I don't.	CHITCHAT
Prioritize.	CHITCHAT
But I think a lot well happen.	O
With the Reflection I'm going to make a new layer put it on multiply mode.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Take a smooth brush.	O
An add some.	O
Shadows of	O
Rocks below the water.	O
That's my goal here will see what it if it actually ends up looking like that.	O
But the idea is there's rocks right below the surface and we see like blurry shadows and forms and we can't quite.	O
See them in as nice detail as the rocks that are above the water, but you can still tell.	O
You know the rough shape and size of them.	O
Yeah, exactly yeah, you Bros.	CHITCHAT
We can, we can paint them in a little bit.	O
But we're not going to get too detailed.	O
Because.	CHITCHAT
Well, we don't need to, like we can just hint at them and I think it will be enough.	O
So for example, can use the smudge brush since this is under the water.	O
It doesn't need to be crystal clear which is really good for us, so that means it's a little bit less work in the painting.	O

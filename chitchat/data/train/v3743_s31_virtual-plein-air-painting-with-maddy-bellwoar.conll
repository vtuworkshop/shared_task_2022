So over here, there's a really dark.	O
Shadow this is all underwater.	O
And the real image looks like sandstone.	O
I wonder if it is I don't really know what?	CHITCHAT
Off the Top of my head I'm not sure.	CHITCHAT
What that looks like?	CHITCHAT
So I turn this layer on a Nov we can see the difference.	O
It definitely cut into the glow, but I think it gave some more dimension.	O
Hey shadow, crafts welcome.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're having a good day.	CHITCHAT
We're painting uh.	CHITCHAT
Cozy waterfall in the forest.	CHITCHAT
In the jungle.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you, it was a little bit of a different workflow this time.	CHITCHAT
I can take you back to the beginning, so we started with this there was a sketch so this was the early stages.	CHITCHAT
And just kept blocking things in.	CHITCHAT
Until they started making more sense.	CHITCHAT
That's where we are now.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, you guys.	CHITCHAT
So there's some rocks under the water that have a little bit.	O
Have a warm color.	O
Just gonna share that in lately.	O
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the early stages of this workflow were very interesting.	O
It looked like a completely abstract piece.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for the nice comments.	CHITCHAT
If anybody came in after we already were you know.	CHITCHAT
After everything was.	CHITCHAT
Like you know already blocked in and you wanted to see those early stages.	CHITCHAT
You can always watch the video later after the stream after it processes.	CHITCHAT
It will be available and let me make sure my tool timeline is still running it is.	CHITCHAT
OK so and it will also have captured with the tool timeline will have captured the tools that I was using and things like that so.	CHITCHAT
It's cool feature.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
There's a rock here.	O
And I want.	CHITCHAT
I want to work on these in the foreground so what's going to happen if I don't.	O
It's suddenly it will be the end of the painting?	O
And everything will look pretty nice except for these rocks, it'll be like No.	O
The painting is ruined.	O
So let's try to deal with them.	O
Even though there's other areas that I'm more excited about working on.	O
So there's some little cracks in the rocks and little.	O
Details.	O
But really it's just a grey rock.	O

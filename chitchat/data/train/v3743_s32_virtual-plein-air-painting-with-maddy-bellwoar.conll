There's not that much, we can do one thing that's going to help is when I paint around the outside of the rock.	O
Water is going to be coming right up on it, and they'll be like a little bit of A.	O
Shine around the outside.	O
That can really help make that make it look like you know water is touching.	O
Touching the surface.	O
I think overall, allowing the left side of the rock the side facing all the light to have a little bit of a glow to it.	O
That can help.	CHITCHAT
Emily.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for being so sweet.	CHITCHAT
I hope you're doing good are you going to be painting, a jellyfish by the way.	CHITCHAT
Is that is that is going to be a thing?	CHITCHAT
And then one more grey rock over here.	O
With some darker shadows also.	O
Let's get a?	CHITCHAT
There's some some kind of Moss, or mold or I don't know what it's called.	O
But there's these little discoloration.	O
Of something that's growing on the rock.	O
And I actually really like the look at school you see this also growing on trees and stuff.	O
So there's a few rocks that have it.	O
It's it's a very high contrast to the rock so I have to be careful.	O
Because it really would draw our attention.	O
Have to do some environments, I might try some under the sea one and add a jellyfish for sure.	CHITCHAT
That's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
He went in there.	CHITCHAT
Alright I think it's working a little bit better.	O
But not the center one that I erased that out.	O
That was better before I.	O
Break fix it.	O
Ah thanks Hebrews.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to do my best to make it an awesome result.	CHITCHAT
I don't want to disappoint.	CHITCHAT
Well, I think.	CHITCHAT
I have a good feeling about this one.	CHITCHAT
Algy Moss Lake in like such things interesting and infinitely variable that's right.	CHITCHAT
I think that's the word I was looking for like in.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I agree.	CHITCHAT
It's really, really pretty natural looking.	CHITCHAT
Gives a nice mood and like you, said there's so many different variations of it.	CHITCHAT
You can kind of like do whatever you want and it's a.	CHITCHAT
Possible.	CHITCHAT
To exist it seems.	CHITCHAT
One thing that's great about painting and natural scenes and landscapes.	CHITCHAT
Is that nature and allows you so much freedom?	CHITCHAT
Can you make people in the next video?	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I don't I don't know I will consider it.	CHITCHAT
I will consider it.	CHITCHAT
I appreciate the suggestion.	CHITCHAT
Uhm I would consider it.	CHITCHAT
I my original plan was to stick with virtual Plein air painting for awhile.	CHITCHAT
Just to get some good practice in this and teach my method of doing it.	CHITCHAT
But I've had a couple of.	CHITCHAT
I had a couple of requests to do profile portraits.	CHITCHAT
So I will consider that I'm actually going to be doing.	CHITCHAT
Portrait studies starting next week in my discord server, so it would kind of go along with it if I were to do.	CHITCHAT
One on stream.	CHITCHAT
Hi David I'm for this one, I'm going to be working on it for about 4 hours altogether probably.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I think that's a good amount as an average for me, sometimes my.	CHITCHAT

My studies will be shorter than that.	CHITCHAT
But if I'm working on something that I want to have a nice result for hours is usually going to be the minimum for me.	CHITCHAT
To get a nice painting, I need usually around that amount of time.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much album and everyone for being here.	CHITCHAT
Leigh Leigh Ash LMAO.	CHITCHAT
I hope I'm saying your name OK.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for being here.	CHITCHAT
At this stage, I'm I'm trying to allow myself to stay stay a little bit loose, because I want to finish the painting in a polished way.	O
But I also want to keep the painterly feel that I've been working on.	O
So it's a difficult balance and there's some areas that I'm not 100% happy with like over here.	O
Maybe.	O
Bierocks they need some.	O
Some work I'm going to add some foliage on Top as well.	O
But I'm going to allow myself to take a larger brush.	O
What I was using earlier in the painting and just kind of come along here and paint more loosely?	O
See what happens.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
That's hard to that's a hard comment to respond to.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Victor I'm sorry, but I think you have.	CHITCHAT
Friendly nice intentions, so thank you for the compliment, but I don't really want to get those type of comments here.	CHITCHAT

Um.	CHITCHAT
Conrad thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I mean, I'm in a happy relationship.	CHITCHAT
I just want to put that out, there, OK, let's.	CHITCHAT
Let's continue.	CHITCHAT
With the painting I'm going to add some more greens.	O
Thank you very much Clifford.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I want to add a little bit more leaf shapes.	O
Up in here.	O
We can actually get to the point of showing some more individual smaller shapes and textures.	O
Now I think.	O
Because we're getting into that phase of detail where I think it's.	O
Yeah, it's time it's time, we're in the detailing phase.	O
We made it we made it here.	CHITCHAT
So we can do things like.	CHITCHAT
There will be some vines coming across.	O
Uh phase are welcome welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
We are working on a painting a?	CHITCHAT
Virtual Plein Air painting, which means we found this reference image through map crunch com which is a way of.	CHITCHAT
Searching through Google Street View images you can check out the link below the stream.	CHITCHAT
And I can give you a little preview of what we've done so when we started the stream.	CHITCHAT
I had a sketch.	O
And blocked in the very basic colours.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Then.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I went from basic shapes and slowly work their way towards.	O
Towards this image and you can always re watch the video later if you like.	CHITCHAT
Thank you thanks everybody.	CHITCHAT
I really appreciate the I really appreciate the nice comments and support on my art.	CHITCHAT

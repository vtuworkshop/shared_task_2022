I'm using?	CHITCHAT
You can definitely ask.	CHITCHAT
Their caged, hi thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to decide where there's a good place to add.	O
Great.	O
Leaves.	O
We want the feeling of light shining through the leaves and kind of pointing towards.	O
The focal point here.	O
We've got.	O
A lot of fines and.	O
Some really cool effects with those types of things.	O
Welcome back saying.	CHITCHAT
You're creating such a nice mood with this reference.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Jackson, Oh, I'm glad you think so.	CHITCHAT
I hope I hope yours is going well, I hope you're having a good time.	CHITCHAT
If you're painting, though.	CHITCHAT
Going to add some more Blues into the Sky here and maybe over here, too.	O
Maybe I'm being a little too shy with.	O
Play coming through the trees.	O
Maybe there would be a lot more places where we'd see little spots of light coming through.	O
Oh, you're welcome enjoy the brushes.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
So appear.	CHITCHAT
I want to put some shines on the leaves and I'm curious how to handle this.	O
I think maybe something like this can work so when we're looking at.	O
Be these areas over here, a lot of the leaves are mostly dark there, mostly in Shadow and then there's just a couple areas.	O
Shining through where it gets really bright there's like a tiny bit of light hitting strongly on some of the leaves.	O
So I'm I'm like a little scared.	CHITCHAT
I'm a little timid to make them so.	O
Bright but Maybe it's cool to do.	O
A Royal Bengal Tiger.	O
I could see a Tiger in the scene.	CHITCHAT
I could see a Tiger getting here.	O
I am using a pen, so I'm using I'm painting on a welcome centriq 22 that's my tablet.	CHITCHAT
Is a screen tablet and?	CHITCHAT
And I'm using a stylus to paint on it.	CHITCHAT
A lot of the brushes I'm using our pressure sensitive.	CHITCHAT
So you would really need to have some kind of tablet doesn't need to be a screen tablet doesn't need to be anything Super Fancy.	CHITCHAT
But it would be really a big help to have a tablet.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no worries.	CHITCHAT
You can't really see it when I'm working I'm sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
You got this, Jackson you've got this.	CHITCHAT
There's a huge rock behind the log supported by standing rock in the shadows.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I saw that you Bros I couldn't decide what to do with it at first I don't know if it's the right choice.	CHITCHAT
But I decided to leave it out of my painting because I felt like.	CHITCHAT

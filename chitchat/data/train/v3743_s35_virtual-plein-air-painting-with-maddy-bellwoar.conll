It was hard to tell what was going on.	CHITCHAT
And it looks like the rock is floating an I don't know it just felt kinda weird so I left it out.	O
I don't know if that's the right idea.	CHITCHAT
I guess it can go anyway.	O
Right we conclude it or not include it.	O
I decided not to.	O
And just make the log like the central focus.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT

Alright so I'm adding some little Datsun noisy texture.	O
Because in the foliage when it gets far enough away that's really all we see anyways just a bunch of dots different colors.	O
I ended up kind of turning this painting into like a one brush challenge not 100%, I can totally say it was 1 brush but.	O
Significant portion of the painting was done with just the one brush.	O
Anne I liked the consistency of that.	O
So I'm going to stick with it.	O
A little bit more.	O
Right so green and Blues.	O
Over here.	O
Bright greens here, the brightest greens are always going to be.	O
Generally, near the Top or where you know where you see through to the Sky right around those areas.	O
Where the leaves might be a little bit thinner than in groups?	O
No.	O
Mills.	CHITCHAT
Um is he says, I'm pretty confused.	CHITCHAT
I thought I saw a YouTube video of a guy, saying that design is that art.	CHITCHAT
I'm getting crazy well, everyone is allowed to make YouTube videos.	CHITCHAT
I feel like you're going to get you can get opinions on everything that doesn't mean we need to.	CHITCHAT
Take them seriously.	CHITCHAT
How can someone even say something like that?	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's just clickbait.	CHITCHAT
Wonder if you can add some light Rays coming through the trees, yeah, maybe maybe so, so The thing is.	O
I don't really have a lot of effects in this uhm.	O
In this painting that are.	O
You know sort of photo shop affects it's I'm using photo shop, but I'm not applying like lens flares and.	O
I mean that's just a dramatic example.	O

But sometimes when I add light Rays and stuff like that, it gives it a very like.	O
Digital kind of graphic look where I'm kind of going for a more traditional vibe.	O
So maybe I can add them, but I'm just a little worried that it'll come across to digital or something.	O
That makes sense.	O
But one thing that we can do to get kind of the look of that is to just lighten things in the right areas.	O
You know if we if I add enough light coming through here.	O
If I brighten all this up then it'll make us feel like lights coming through.	O
Even without actual raise or anything like that.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
So from this layer to this layer, it's getting a lot more messy.	O
It is getting more detailed.	O
But.	O
I'm going to erase out a little bit of what I did in the water.	O
That's one of the reasons that I do like to keep separate layers like that.	O
And maybe we can do some adjustment layers.	O
How to reply to specific comments I think you can put AT and the person's name I'm not sure if it might be.	CHITCHAT
Be.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's not working but I have been able to do that before.	CHITCHAT
Um so.	CHITCHAT
You can try that Roman.	CHITCHAT
And then they will get A tag.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm going to make a new layer and make an adjustment layer so on my layers palette.	O
Uh my layers pool is covered right now, but let me move it over here, so you can see what I'm doing.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
You go to the.	O
Like half circle divided icon here and then you can press.	O
Press that down and then go to whatever type of adjustment layer you want to use.	O
And I think.	CHITCHAT
I will go with something like levels.	O
And we can play with the levels.	O
The darks and lights in the image and see.	O
If we want to make things a little bit more dramatic.	O
We can go we can mess with the mid tones.	O
Arrange the highlights.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to undo that.	O
And then try again fresh.	O
I kind of want to darken things a little bit.	O
I don't know if I don't know if that's the right direction to go in.	O
But I'm imagining maybe if I darken things I can make that center area stand out a little bit more.	O
As being really bright so for example, everything starker.	O
An I can go to this layer and use my airbrush.	O
And mask away.	O
The area that I want to be later, so for example, back here this distant foliage.	O
We don't want that to get darker.	O
We want it to look like there's more atmosphere.	O
Between send those trees, so they can still be later.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
And there's a little bit of a glow of light around the focal point, so that can also be later.	O
But basically this just creates a little bit of A.	O
Like a big net around everything else.	O
Which I think is OK?	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I will play with things like adjustment layers for.	O
Color balance.	O
You can go through The Shadows Midtones and highlights these sliders.	O
And decide if you want to add more blue more yellow, I mean.	O
Look how different that mood is.	O
I tend to really like, adding blue and magenta into the shadows.	O
But it can go pretty much.	O
Yeah, you just have to see how things feel, but I like to use the sliders just.	O
Just looking at them just kind of seeing what looks good.	O
Midtones.	O
Think Midtones being a little bit more warm makes sense in this situation.	O
And then highlights.	O
And sometimes I do a bunch of changes and then I look later turn.	O
The layer on and off and I don't like it so let's see.	O
Before.	O
After before after.	O
It got a lot more green.	O
I think I lost some of those nuances.	O
Of the Yeah, I don't really like it, but what I do like is the water.	O

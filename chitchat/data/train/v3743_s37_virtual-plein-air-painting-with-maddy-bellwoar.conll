I do like that warm glow in the water so I can basically like mask everything out except that area.	O
And leave that.	O
Good stuff to explore adjustments, yeah, it is fun to use.	O
Is there a time during your painting that you just want to erase everything and start over not on every painting Luckily, but every once in awhile?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
Like I don't know I can't give you a percentage.	CHITCHAT
It's generally pretty rare.	CHITCHAT
But every once in awhile.	CHITCHAT
I start a painting and I go about it for awhile and then I realize.	CHITCHAT
It would have maybe been better if I.	CHITCHAT
Had started this in a different way this workflow they don't work, and then at that point I'm like.	CHITCHAT
It would make so much more sense to just start over you know.	CHITCHAT
So, sometimes in those situations.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I want to just start over.	CHITCHAT
Or if I just really hate how painting is going.	CHITCHAT
We usually not usually not locally.	CHITCHAT
Another adjustment layer I like is selective color.	O
So, in this one, you can choose a specific color range like.	O
Let's try greens 'cause there's a lot of green in this and then you can move the sliders through.	O
Each of these so for example.	O
For everything in the image that has that is green you can adjust do you want to have more or less cyan?	O
Like do we want it to be more natural yellow green kind of earthy feeling or do we want more.	O
Like almost tropical jungle blue green you know you can take things into different directions.	O
What about magenta?	O
How much magenta do we want?	O
Look at the difference.	O
Sometimes it doesn't even.	O
You wouldn't even think like I don't even think of a lot of these things when I'm painting.	O
You know, I'm just doing what I think looks right and then when you go.	CHITCHAT
To this step, you really like whoa look makes you notice things in a different way I think.	CHITCHAT
Uhm and then you can adjust the values.	O
So yeah, the yellows so that's kind of cool if we take away cyan from the yellows.	O
Look how much more like.	O
Glowy they get.	O
So a sort of dangerous thing in this.	O
Area of the painting is that you can really change things a lot.	O
You can really change things a lot, so.	CHITCHAT
You have to be careful, sometimes after I do changes.	O
I look at the painting in black-and-white an icy.	O
I tried to say, Um I try to figure out if I'm making a change.	O
That's really changing the.	O
Value structure in a good or bad way.	O
Or maybe it doesn't change it at all, and that's OK.	O
The last thing I want to look at is magentas I know there's a lot of.	O
Magenta in this or Purples.	O
Yeah, so we can either.	CHITCHAT
I know it's subtle.	O
But if you look at the rocks.	O
We can either take away the magenta purple color.	O
Or we can add it and I like.	O
I like the magenta effect, so I'm OK with it.	O
Being pretty intense.	O
Then we can make the rocks darker later.	O
So if I were to group all these or just merge it down.	O
So that they are all combined here's the before and after, so before.	O
After.	O
Before.	O
After.	O
Before.	O
After so I think it really does bring your I'm or to the center.	O
And a little bit more saturated overall.	O
I like it so we'll keep going.	O
So let me see what time it is.	O
Alright we're doing good, I think we have about.	CHITCHAT
About 3045 minutes of streams ago, so I'm going to do my best to make this nice and polished and.	CHITCHAT
Looking good at it by the end of that time and we'll see how it goes if we need to take a little bit more extra time I can.	CHITCHAT
But I think that should do it.	O
Do you selective color layer when everything else is merged yes usually usually?	O
Because um?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I find it a little annoying because if you don't then.	O
You have to maybe apply it to different layers that are separate from each other and then if your color picking an painting below the adjustment layer it gets a little confusing sometimes.	O
So I prefer to do it for me when it's merged but.	O
You know, everyone has different preferences.	O
Alright so I'm going to paint some of the water highlights here and I don't know if this brush is going to be the way to go, but I'm just going to try it.	O
So I'm just sketching in um.	O
Some water reflections.	O
There's a couple.	O
Basically, the water reflections are mirroring the.	O

The Sky if you look up wherever there's a breaks in the.	O
The foliage and you're seeing the blue Sky.	O
That's also reflecting on the water here.	O
Really, like the highlights on the Lone Tree on the right very nice thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you project.	CHITCHAT
That tree was fun to pain.	CHITCHAT
We got some really bright.	O
Areas on the water over here, but with a lot more yellow.	O
A lot brighter.	O
More saturated.	O
And then there's also there's a lot of stuff going on the water has a lot of colors, reflecting in it, there's also.	O
Some yellows and greens reflecting.	O
And there's also the blue Sky, reflecting it's it has a little bit more of a blue purple Hue than when I.	O
And what I did let me try to.	O
Get that color a little bit.	O
Working a little bit better.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That's a start up let's take the smudge brush.	O
And smudge some of these.	O
Lines so I hope that's going to give it a little bit more of A.	O
Of a water you liquidy look.	O
Little bit of a soft edge is there.	O
This is going to be multi layer process, I think.	O
Around the rocks there's a little bit of a shadow.	O
So basically if they're curved under and meeting the water like this.	O
There's going to be a little shadow.	O
Would creating a new layer just for the water on the rocks help.	O
It make it more realistic.	O
Not the waterfall talk about the city com water.	CHITCHAT
Creating new layer for just the water on the rocks help.	O
I'm trying to understand what you're talking about.	CHITCHAT
I think I think what you're saying is you want to see more of the rock under the water.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
So I can paint that I can paint that in.	O
Like just a little bit more of.	O
What's going on underneath?	O
I think.	O
I can get away with.	O
Just putting a little bit of that on this one rock here.	O
I'm not going to get super detailed with the water and the stuff going on underneath of it 'cause I think.	O
I don't think it's really needed.	O
I think if we get sucked into going into that detail we might.	O
Half the painted everywhere.	O
You know, so I was like.	O
When you're simplifying things.	O
And it's working and then you add a detail somewhere, then you kind of your brain wants to see that figured out everywhere.	O
And I think that's going to be a little too much for for this painting.	O
So basically for me, I just have these like shadow shapes here.	O
And that's supposed to be hinting at rocks and the water.	O
Maybe it's not pulling it of- under percent.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
I think it's I think it's OK.	CHITCHAT
For the amount of time, we have.	CHITCHAT
I like a little bit of blue in the water.	O
I'm just noticing it.	O
There's a little bit of gradients.	O
Blue green gradients going on over here.	O
Under the water.	O
Going to make a new layer put it on screen mode.	O
Don't really know if that's the right layer mode for what I want but I'm going to experiment a little bit.	O

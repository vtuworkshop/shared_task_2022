I want to add some lighting effects that are just.	O
Giving the idea of light bouncing off the water.	O
And creating a soft glow.	O
You might not be.	O
Yeah, I will lower the opacity a little bit 'cause That's a bit strong, but that is kind of what I want.	O
Just a little bit of A.	O
But glow.	O
Going to be brave.	CHITCHAT
If we want cool moods in the painting sometimes you gotta be brave.	CHITCHAT
A little bit of light on these rocks here.	O
Hopefully, that will help give them some kind of 3D feeling and dimension.	O
Going to flip this.	O
So we're going to breed outside.	CHITCHAT
It's too quiet is really quiet here right now, which is actually refreshing.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't happen too often.	CHITCHAT
I'm exaggerating a bit, but my neighbor, sometimes will likes to play basketball or do some other noisy things.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'm streaming.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
The choir is just fine.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's nice if we get some little bird sounds or something like that, sometimes we get rain.	CHITCHAT
Rain ASMR.	CHITCHAT
Specially, I'm living here in the Netherlands and we have had a lot of rain this autumn.	CHITCHAT
Quite a lot.	CHITCHAT
No screaming children, Yes, that is well, I also live near an elementary school and.	CHITCHAT
Usually around certain times of day, you'll hear them like.	CHITCHAT
Getting.	CHITCHAT
Out of school.	CHITCHAT
Screening.	CHITCHAT
Happy screams, but still like no not now.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Let's try a layer on color Dodge because we all love a good color, Dodge later.	O
I want to play with the idea of.	O
The shape of this light area.	O
Who another not the color want?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, maybe that.	O
But having this area be a little bit more defined as like a specific shape.	O
Sometimes you have to go through the.	O
The options of colored when you're using color Dodge or some of these things.	O
That's way too strong.	O
It's like really intense.	O
I'm just going to get rid of it.	O
All right, let's put the layer on fillet layer with black baton color, Dodge mode, sometimes we get better results with this.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Little bit better.	CHITCHAT
It preserves the values a little bit more.	O
Hey Christina welcome.	CHITCHAT
So I kind of like the?	O
Strong shape of the edge of the highlight on that rock.	O
Oh, OK Mills, let me scroll up.	CHITCHAT
Mill says I forgot did you get to take any winter photos yet or is it too early to early here.	CHITCHAT
We're still in fall even though it feels very cold it still looks like autumn and.	CHITCHAT

There's also some little breaks in the.	CHITCHAT
We see through to the.	O
Sky back here, but I don't know if I should do that.	O
I don't know if it's going to be too too, attracting of our attention.	O
Maybe if I lower the Opacity.	O
That's a tough one.	CHITCHAT
That's true project well that's a whole different thing.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
That's a whole different thing.	CHITCHAT
At the moment I'm pretty.	CHITCHAT
Pretty much sticking towards realistic.	CHITCHAT
Bike.	CHITCHAT
Things that at this time I can paint in that exists so sci-fi is a really tough one 'cause you end up having to construct a lot of.	CHITCHAT
Of yourself so maybe in the future.	CHITCHAT
I will be more prepared for that at the moment I feel like I still.	CHITCHAT
I still would have a challenge with it.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha ha.	CHITCHAT
I play 3D my English is not good.	CHITCHAT
That's OK, you're doing good, I can understand you.	CHITCHAT
But if you want.	CHITCHAT
Let me know what I can call you because I don't.	CHITCHAT

I hope you guys are having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out with me.	CHITCHAT
It was nice to get the paint, something really relaxing.	CHITCHAT
The last few streams here, I've been picking really challenging references for myself.	CHITCHAT
And I like to challenge myself, but in between there.	CHITCHAT
You gotta like have some comfort zone stuff to enjoy.	CHITCHAT
Even though we did try something new with the workflow here.	CHITCHAT
I love this type of setting and I feel comfortable painting.	CHITCHAT
Waterfalls and natural scenes.	CHITCHAT
So it was nice to do something like that.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
I'll pull ahead.	O
Thank you for the next comment.	CHITCHAT
I'm very tempted to use a?	CHITCHAT
A leaf brush or something like that just because there's a lot of I'd like to have a like.	O
Quite a bit more.	O
Detail.	O
They want to hire detail level.	CHITCHAT
And we're trying to figure out how to do that in the short time.	CHITCHAT
But I'm going to try to stick with just sketching sketching them in loosely with the brush.	O
'Cause I like the look right now that it's been all really hand painted.	O
There's one thing that I really like in the reference that I haven't gotten yet and that is the feeling of these different like vines and things up here so I'm just going to.	O
Paint in some hanging up.	O
Fines and try to get.	O
The look up some of these individual little plants.	O
Just at the end I think it's possible for us to look at these kind of details.	O
Make some leaves reaching out to the middle.	O

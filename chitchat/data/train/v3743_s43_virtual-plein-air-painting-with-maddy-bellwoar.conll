I'm going to turn on color dynamics.	O
And turn of.- Apply per tip, so that means with each of paint stroke.	O
It should give a slightly different.	O
Q It's not going to be a very big change because my?	O
Settings aren't set up for that.	O
Thank you very much for the nice comments you guys.	CHITCHAT
I really appreciate you being here and being so encouraging.	CHITCHAT
You I will be doing this every every Wednesday.	CHITCHAT

So I'm going to add some.	O
Brighter leaves the background here and maybe I'll try putting the brush spacing.	O
Up and putting on scattering and I don't know maybe I can.	O
More quickly paint some textures if I do this.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Trying to decide where I can have like, some little branches coming out from the shadows.	O
I think it will help this still look a little bit more lush.	O
If I have some individual.	O
Branches and leaves that can be really identified as plans.	O
Right now, it's a catch is a mass of green and I would like there to be a little bit more logic to it.	O
Let me think we happening with the rocks in the foreground or as they find, as they are.	O
There are bits uhm.	CHITCHAT
Basic compared to the rest of the painting as far as detailed level, but They are something that I kind of want to be ignored so.	O
I don't really want to draw a drawer, I to them.	O
So I think I'd like to get away with leaving them close to the way that they are now.	O
But I might it might be wise for me to work on them a little bit more just because sometimes.	O
Yeah, if they look really bad that's going to attract our attention to.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
No thank you Erin glad you think so.	CHITCHAT
Is this for a portfolio?	CHITCHAT
I might put it in My Portfolio here on be hands, but it's not for a specific um.	CHITCHAT
It's not for portfolio to get a specific job or anything like that, it's more for practice.	CHITCHAT

Improve my landscape painting and values an understanding of.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm just everything colors and mood lighting and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT

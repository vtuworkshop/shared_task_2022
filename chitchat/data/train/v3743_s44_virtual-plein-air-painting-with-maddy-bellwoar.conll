That's surprising to me.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
It might be partially because of the.	O
The amount of.	O
Contrast here that could be drawing I a little bit.	O
Another thing we can do to try to hide it hide them a little bit is add some foliage.	O
I can go to a bigger brush.	O
You know, and add some greens on Top of this rock and.	O
Maybe this one.	O
They don't have to be extremely well sorted out.	O
Thank you Marcus.	CHITCHAT
So what I mean, is we don't have to get very, very polished with the foliage I think.	O
But we do have to.	O
Pick the right colors and.	O
And values so that it reads as.	CHITCHAT
It reads in the correct lighting and things like that.	O
Like a cinematic thing cheating where the eye goes, yeah, I hope so.	O
That's what I'm that's what I'm going for is like we don't want you to look there.	O
But you guys can let me know like everyone has a different.	CHITCHAT
Vision or perception or or Whatnot Ann.	CHITCHAT
So you guys can other people can chime into an let me know like where your where do you think you're the focal point is here?	CHITCHAT
What's attracting your attention?	CHITCHAT
Is there anything attracting your attention?	CHITCHAT
You don't like.	CHITCHAT
That kind of thing.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I can add some.	O
Silhouettes here be cause the?	O
The foliage is going to be darker than the background.	O
We can add some grasses and things and that might be nice.	O
Interior design CG artist ice.	CHITCHAT
It's very cool.	CHITCHAT
Maybe there's some plants that are more like A.	O
Make a poem sort of thing like that.	CHITCHAT
Does it change?	CHITCHAT
Have your landscape studies change how you look at nature Oh yes.	CHITCHAT
And Yeah, but yes to both of those doing a lot of landscape studies has changed how I see nature absolutely.	CHITCHAT
And it's changed how I take photos it changed everything like I just I notice different things like I notice.	CHITCHAT
Things with the lighting and different opportunities like.	CHITCHAT
Little things that he didn't care about before that, they are things that I find attractive in painting.	CHITCHAT
Now I notice them in real life more.	CHITCHAT
So it's hard to think of an example.	CHITCHAT
But just different lighting scenarios bounce light or mostly just things to do with colors and lighting.	CHITCHAT
Also texture.	CHITCHAT
But very much so with taking photos.	CHITCHAT
Luckily, I've improved the taking photo is not in the sense that I like I'm really good photographer anything.	CHITCHAT
But I'm making better compositions in my photos, so I didn't realize that I was.	CHITCHAT
Making bad compositions before until I started getting into doing these paintings and then I noticed looking back at my photos that like a lot of them.	CHITCHAT
We just completely no thought into the composition you know just looking at something and taking a picture of it.	CHITCHAT
Like even things that I would take a picture of for my own reference.	CHITCHAT
There was no thought of composition.	CHITCHAT
It was just take a picture of the thing I might use it later.	CHITCHAT
Whereas now regardless of what I need a photo for I'm still going to try to make a good composition of it.	CHITCHAT
You know like it's just have more practice with that and it's become more.	CHITCHAT
It's become more easy for me to see.	CHITCHAT
An opportunity for a good composition.	CHITCHAT
If it feels good to be able to notice that like that, it's helping that studies are helping.	CHITCHAT
Do you think it's weird to look at the photo in grayscale before taking pictures in nature?	CHITCHAT
No, I don't think that anything is weird if there's some kind of thing that helps you visualize what you.	CHITCHAT
Are doing whether it's in photography or art or anything?	CHITCHAT
I think it's totally fine to do you know?	CHITCHAT

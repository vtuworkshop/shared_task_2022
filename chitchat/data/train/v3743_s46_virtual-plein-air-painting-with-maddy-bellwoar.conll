Thank you Devan Union I'm using Windows.	CHITCHAT
And yeah, I'm using Windows 10 and I'm using my left hand for the keyboard shortcuts.	CHITCHAT
I reprogrammed a lot of them so that.	CHITCHAT
I could reach everything with my left hand.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Because well, yeah, you know a lot of the default shortcuts.	CHITCHAT
You need both hands, but I'm drawing with my right hand so.	CHITCHAT
It's it is very nice, though I that's one of the reasons that I.	CHITCHAT
I love to use the keyboard is that I know that I can always rely on it.	CHITCHAT
I have a welcome centriq 22 and I know a lot of people like to use the well actually the.	CHITCHAT
Isn't that I have doesn't have the buttons around it?	CHITCHAT
Some of the some of the.	CHITCHAT
Some of them do have their own buttons, but I prefer to just use the keyboard.	CHITCHAT
'cause I know it's always going to be.	CHITCHAT
I was going to be the same.	CHITCHAT
Ebro says if you ever get a chance.	CHITCHAT
Please make a step by step video of your paintings like step.	CHITCHAT
One making the line step to adding the base colors to 3 highlights.	CHITCHAT
I do think it's a good idea your Bros I would like to do that sometime.	CHITCHAT
It's been a long time since I've done something like that.	CHITCHAT
Card the reason I didn't for a long time was because I was so much was changing with my art.	CHITCHAT
I was.	CHITCHAT
And even now, I'm always like trying new workflows.	CHITCHAT
But That being said, I do have some methods that I paint in that I think I'm.	CHITCHAT
That I used enough that I think I would be happy to make a tutorial it just takes time.	CHITCHAT
It takes time to do it.	CHITCHAT
But I would like to do that at some point.	CHITCHAT
Like I try to explain what I'm doing as I stream, but I understand that it's not so easy to follow along in this kind of setting and I mean, I hope that I can make it.	CHITCHAT
Is easy as possible but I understand it's not quite as easy as following along with a tutorial that goes really step by step.	CHITCHAT
Especially because there's a random.	CHITCHAT
There's random.	CHITCHAT
Questions and things that can.	CHITCHAT
Take us into different conversations, so I might talk about something different than what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Um heiser heat, I will try to speak more slowly when I get going, sometimes you know you go into.	CHITCHAT
You just go into autopilot and start speaking fast.	CHITCHAT
I think maybe I do speak a little fast, but I'll try.	CHITCHAT
Great picture right there, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to lock.	O
The layer and add a little bit of highlights on too.	O
This little Bush here.	O
Bill use an airbrush.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
I feel like that Bush could have a little bit more effort.	O
I'm like trying to quickly do it at the end, but	CHITCHAT
I don't think that's the way to do that.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's try to get the little better shading there.	O
D prefer painting water rocks or plants.	O
Implants.	CHITCHAT
That'll be plants, Aaron, but I really enjoyed everything in this scene.	CHITCHAT
I do like also painting water I find it difficult.	CHITCHAT
And rocks, I don't really like painting, but I like looking at them.	CHITCHAT
I like looking at paintings where they're painted well.	CHITCHAT
I just want to get better at painting rocks.	CHITCHAT
'Cause it sunset time it is can you tell it's getting darker?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, the sun, it said so.	CHITCHAT
Early now.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Oh Jackson, the brush that I'm using that I used to paint most of this painting is the.	O

This kind of effect going on with it for most of the painting.	O
And.	O
That's a different thing than what it has a default so other than that it's.	CHITCHAT

I definitely do I love painting foliage the most.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
There's certain effects that I really like to paint alike.	CHITCHAT
Like where things kind of fade into the distance and get a little bit lighter and less detailed that's an effect.	CHITCHAT
Feels very satisfying to paint like back here how this green is a little bit lighter and.	CHITCHAT
Um less.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it was.	CHITCHAT
Less saturated.	CHITCHAT
That kind of stuff.	CHITCHAT

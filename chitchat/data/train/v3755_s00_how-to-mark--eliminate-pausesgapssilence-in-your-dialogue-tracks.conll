My name is Jason Levine and for today's brief live stream.	CHITCHAT
We're going to be talking to you about something that I get asked about a lot.	CHITCHAT
In fact, it was recently asked on my YouTube channel.	CHITCHAT
And so I thought I'd showed you today, which is quite simply what's an easy and somewhat automated way to remove?	O
Gaps or more importantly, how to identify mark and find gaps and silence and other things in your dialogue tracks.	O
And then what are some best practices are easy ways to remove them?	O
I'm going to show you some of the options here again some of this is automated.	O
Being automated, it doesn't always get it right the first time, but you've got lots of flexibility.	O
And I'm going to show you that in Adobe audition, so as always give a couple shots into the chat here Marco.	O
Ankit Yoni Saeed.	CHITCHAT

And we're going to hop over to hold on.	O
Let me just minimize my focusrite mixer here.	O
An let's hop over to audition OK.	O
So as mentioned there's a lot of there's a lot of ways to do this?	O
What's up CUDA cash.	CHITCHAT
Uh there's a lot of different ways to do this.	CHITCHAT
But in a really easy way is to use the diagnostics panel where we actually have.	O
A mark audio function now for those of you who are kind of old school.	O
You know that we used to have lots of different options for marking.	O
Dialogue and silence and pauses and things in previous versions of audition lot of that tech has been confined to the diagnostics panel.	O
It's just kind of hidden in there, I've shown the clipping in there, I've shown the clicking in there.	O
I'm not sure if I've shown recently the mark audio section.	O
So the first thing you want to do is go.	O
Your window menu.	O
And open up the diagnostics panel not sure where it's going to dock for you by default, but you can see that I've got mine.	O
Duct up here in the upper left an under the effects.	O

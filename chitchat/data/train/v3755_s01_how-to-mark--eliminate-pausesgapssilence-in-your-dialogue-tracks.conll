Uh.	CHITCHAT
Fly out menu which.	O
It's also an odd choice of a name, there really marking an audio shouldn't be in effect, but alright whatever.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Note to the engineers if anyone's anyones watching right now, we need to kind of rethink that one.	CHITCHAT
Um declare that the Clipper.	O
Delete silence and then Mark Audio.	O
We're going to focus on Mark and delete silence today.	O
All right.	O
Now, as always, we give you a couple of preset options will talk about these.	O
I'm actually going to show you this kind of the manual way 'cause I think you're going to get a lot more.	O
A lot more mileage a lot more of ease of use out of this feature.	O
And the manual way is really just as easy so I'm going to show you how alright so first.	O
Let's take a listen.	O
This is just something that I recorded.	O
Uh just a few minutes ago as an example here.	CHITCHAT
Uh what's up, Tim just to kind of showcase?	CHITCHAT
What we're looking to do here and you can kind of see already if you're an audio person.	O
You can see the gaps you can see what we'd likely want to cut out or remove.	O
If nothing else.	O
This also makes it easier to manipulate that dialogue in the multi track or wherever your going to be assembling this alright.	O
Let's just take a quick listen 1st in here what we've got.	O
In today's brief tutorial.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to show you how to use auditions marking features to eliminate pauses.	CHITCHAT
The main idea here is that if you have elongated pauses.	CHITCHAT
You can automatically mark these and then take them away.	CHITCHAT
Now of course, there is a tradeoff here as sometimes you want the pauses to kind of convey mood or emotion.	CHITCHAT
But you do have some options to adjust that duration and make things a little smoother.	CHITCHAT
In the process.	CHITCHAT
OK.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
In a somewhat uncharacteristic way I'm reading this very deliberately and slowly.	O
Perfectly timed hydration break thank you.	O
Dude, I miss your comments it's good to virtually CU Evan Abrams, everybody you should check out EC Abrams.	CHITCHAT
Channel on YouTube by the way if you're looking for.	CHITCHAT
To really understand after effects motion graphics motion design.	CHITCHAT
Evan Abrams Good Buddy of mine, he spent on Adobe live multiple times.	CHITCHAT
He's hosted Adobe live.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
A true fountain of knowledge and I highly recommend his channel so.	CHITCHAT
Be sure to you should put that up in the chat or something.	CHITCHAT
Dude, OK alright so you've got my audio in front of you here.	O
All right, so let's go to diagnostics an first.	O
The first thing I just want to do is show you how you can mark the audio.	O
Not even talking about eliminating pauses or silence just yet.	O
Just marking it because ultimately this is a pretty short piece.	O
But if I've read copy for let's say 30 seconds a minute.	O
And I'm doing this for a commercial for voice over or something.	O
It just comes it becomes really handy if I can just very quickly kind of separate.	O
All the little spoken pieces.	O
So here on Mark Audio.	O
I'm going to use I'm actually in a default preset here.	O
I just changed something earlier on.	O
But the first thing you're going to do.	O
Is scan the audio and when you do that?	O
It's going to identify sections that it thinks are rich with audio content.	O
Now there's a secondary function here if you click on the settings button all right now, this by default.	O
This may look a little daunting a little scary.	CHITCHAT
Super nerdy.	CHITCHAT
Effectively, this isn't a section that uses the algorithm to define what is silence and what is audio now?	O
You can look at this visually or you can read meters there, you go YouTube.	CHITCHAT
Com EC Abrams OK.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Evan.	CHITCHAT
You can use this or look at the meters or look at the actual waveform view and kind of determine.	O
What signal defines silence so anything below you can see here negative 67 DB for more than 100?	O
Milliseconds is determined as silence and audio is anything above minus 58 for more than 25 milliseconds OK.	O
Now this was actually done via this find levels button, so you don't even have to do anything if you click on that.	O
It's going to identify what are effectively threshold levels OK so it's going to do all of this for you?	O
Now again it's not always going to get it exactly right.	O
I tend to think this probably is pretty good, so let's go ahead and just.	O
Scan this one more time OK, so I found these 5 sections.	O
Alright go ahead and let's Mark all.	O
Click on Mark all.	O
And just by doing that what you'll see.	O
Now is it has gone in and created marker regions for.	O
Each of the spoken passages an in the markers panel.	O
In audition, which you can see whoops, which you can see right over here.	O
I now have 5 sections with their start and end times and their duration basically isolating all of those spoken.	O
Messages so let's take a listen and see what it did let's click on the first one here.	O
In today's brief tutorial.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to show you how to use auditions marking features to eliminate pauses.	CHITCHAT

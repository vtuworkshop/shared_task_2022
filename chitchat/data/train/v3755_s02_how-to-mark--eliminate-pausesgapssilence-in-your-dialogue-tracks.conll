OK very nice didn't cut off the end good.	O
Let's take a listen to the next one.	O
The main idea here is that if you have elongated pauses.	O
You can automatically mark these and then take them away.	O
The main idea here now I've got this little like thing at the at the beginning right there, it detected that is.	O
Spoken word again this is where you can adjust those thresholds accordingly.	O
RTV media online nice to see you let's check take out the next one here now.	O
Of course, there is a tradeoff here as sometimes you want the pauses to kind of convey mood or emotion.	O
Now of course, OK pretty tight, but still good, but you do have some options to adjust that duration and make things a little smoother.	O
But you do have some options and the last one in the process in the process in the process.	O
OK.	O
So right away you can imagine you have a very long piece of audio this already marked everything for us.	O
OK, So what do we do?	CHITCHAT
What if we wanted to be able to take these audio bits and move them around?	O
Couple of options here.	O
So this was partially contained in a multitrack session here, so couple of things you could do.	O
Sometimes people just like the ability to simply select things and kind of clip and move them around So what this allows you to do.	O
Is to essentially?	O
Select those markers.	O
And then you can do one of two things you can split.	O
Audio.	O
Which basically just takes it out?	O
Uh of the original tracker, but again this is all non destructive so we're just moving things around virtually.	O
But what it's going to do is it's going to cut all those sections out so that we can move around freely alright.	O
So I'm going to do that right now, I'm just highlighting between the sections here split split.	O
Split also a fantastic movie by my friend, Anne Yours M night.	CHITCHAT
Shama lawn and now I can just move.	CHITCHAT
These pieces around and you can see that the silence.	O
Is left behind and we know that these sections are perfect?	O
Nothing is cut off everything?	O
Is there it sounds great?	O
It's good to go all right now that's slightly manual in the sense that I had to make selections there, but You get the idea and this gives you a lot of flexibility because all the marking that's kind of the laborious part that's the tedious part.	O
So it did all of that for us, OK, so that's if we're doing this in the multi track.	O
Now you have a couple of other options here as well.	O
Let's just zoom out full here, so again.	O
Here's our original track.	O
Multitrack is non destructive.	O
Nothing is actually been touched here.	O
Once you mark those regions.	O
Once you mark those sections, something that I personally like to do is I will often take all of those marked sections.	O
And export them out as separate files.	O
Right especially if it's copy that I'm reading so it might be like this is audio copy.	O
This is video copy.	O
This is colour correction copy Anile Label, an number them accordingly, well actually it will do the numbering for me.	O
So if you want to break this out into separate files entirely keeping the original intact and by the way you can save the original with all those markers.	O
You can highlight all of the markers that it created for you inside the markers panel.	O
And then you'll see, there's this little button here that says export audio of selected range markers 2 separate files.	O
Let's go ahead and click on that and we can give it a prefix.	O
If we want so I'll say.	O
I'll call this you know how to mark.	O
Alright tell it where you want it to go.	O
Let's just stick it here.	O
We're going to make a new folder on the desktop.	O
Just to keep things nice and clean.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
Thirst.	O
Choose.	O
Alright sample type now this is got some conversion going on here we can just keep this all same as source, so same as source same as source.	O
In this case this is all mono 48 K 32 bit float.	O
Oh yeah, I've been saying that will be very nice for moving clips around in animation project exactly because.	O
Again, if you've got stuff that you have copy for rather than nondestructively moving pieces just have them a separate audio files.	O
You still have the original if you want you still have all the marked regions.	O
This just makes it a little bit easier.	O
So we're going to click OK on this click export.	O
It's already done now, if I go into my files panel.	O
Let's go to the desktop.	O
Hurst.	O
There's all my files notice they're all labeled how to mark and then it added the actual marker labels.	O
Adjacent to them by the way it's taking the names of the markers an appending them there, so realistically I should have just called this.	O
How to mark underscore in the marker itself and then it would have just taken those names rather than adding a prefix.	O
We give you lots of naming options just like in prelude in some of the other apps.	O
You get the idea Go ahead and click open and now each of those pieces is its own file.	O
In today's brief tutorial there's first one.	O
The main idea here second now of course, 3rd but you do have some awful worth in the process 5th OK.	O

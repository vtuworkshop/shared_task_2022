So.	CHITCHAT
A really quick way.	O
To mark the audio.	O
Identify spoken sections.	O
Export as separate files or take those marks sections from the multitrack.	O
Split them.	O
And then freely move them around OK.	O
Couple of different cool options, there alright.	CHITCHAT
But we're not done yet.	O
Let's go back over to this, let's go back to our original file and I'm actually going to.	O
Let's remove.	O
Remove all of my.	O
All my markers.	O
All right.	CHITCHAT
Why is it not letting me delete my markers?	CHITCHAT
Let me get rid of all these things 1st.	O
OK.	O
All right back over to diagnostics.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I mentioned there's a couple of resets in here OK.	O
We're going to give this a shot.	O
I don't know how well it's going to do so you'll see that there are 3 in here right.	O
One is ignore short sentence is.	O
OK, I'm not quite sure what that means another is mark non silent areas.	O
That's what we just did right.	O
We marked non silence so we marked dialogue.	O
Interesting choice.	O
Mark non silent and then mark the speech.	O
I never notice that aren't those both the same thing.	O
I don't know I don't know what any of this means.	CHITCHAT
Alright well, let's see what happens if we do.	O
Mark non silent areas.	O
I don't know what that's supposed to do.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to scan OK, it found 5 sections who wants to guess it's going to mark the same ones.	O
Yeah, it did because non silence would be dialogue OK.	O
Let's check out the second reset here mark the speech.	O
Let's can.	CHITCHAT
OK, now this, this found 23 sections.	O
So let's click on Mark all.	O
OK, So what mark the speech did is it identified more notes for the engineering team, it identified sort of.	O
Each section.	O
Or piece of talking.	O
Inside.	O
The dialogue, he ran it, even left off a few so like.	O
Here is here is here is.	O
Have have?	O
Elongated long gated.	O
Follow up.	O
Automatically marked automatically marked automatically mark I mean, I guess there's some use for this.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Perhaps.	CHITCHAT
I don't really know so as I told you that the pause thing I don't know.	CHITCHAT
I'm just I'm just not I'm just not sure.	CHITCHAT
But here we're going to get to the house is now because now I just showed you we showed you how to mark.	O
The audio that you want.	O
Let's talk about eliminating the audio that you don't want which in this case.	O
Is silence OK now again under the preset menu here?	O
You've got keep fun parts speed up the lecture trim long silent pauses.	O
Trim short digital dropouts, OK and again.	O
We're under delete silence.	O
Here, now, so I switched it from Mark audio to delete silence alright.	O
I'm going to just go to the settings again and click on find levels OK and it's going to do its analysis here.	O
So let's see OK.	O
And let's go ahead and scan.	O
Right and it found 5 problems 5 areas of silence so let's see how it did.	O
Let's delete them.	O
And it looks pretty good all right, and let's take a listen to what it did the main idea here is that if you have elongated pauses you can automatically mark these and then take them away.	O
Now of course, there is a tradeoff here as sometimes you want the pauses to kind of convey mood or emotion.	O
But you do have some options to adjust that duration and make things a little smoother in the process.	O
So all of this sounded pretty good, except that last little bit right there because there was just.	O
There's just not enough pause things a little smoother in the process things a little smoother in the process.	O
Right so I might come in here.	O
And add a little silence, which by the way is up under the edit menu.	O
Insert.	O
Silence.	O
And you know something like.	CHITCHAT
You know a 10th of a second here.	O
Things a little smoother in the process right just like that.	O
So now it sounds so much more just normal like normal pace duration and make things a little smoother.	O
In the process.	O
100 milliseconds.	O
How did you know 100 milliseconds a 10th of a second?	O
Again think about like standard kind of pausing if you're talking.	O
This isn't slow this isn't rapid it's just kind of.	O

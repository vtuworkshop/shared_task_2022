Normal pace.	O
A 10th.	O
1/5 of a second.	O
That's usually about the duration that you want.	O
The key here is that right away.	O
It zapped out all of that silence an edited everything else together for us, nicely pretty slick.	O
Pretty cool, but as I mentioned you know depends it may not do it the way you want.	O
All the time so it can be a little challenging so let's go and let's actually see what these.	O
Resets do.	O
So.	O
Let's say just keep the fun parts.	O
OK, it's not detecting anything with just keep the fun parts, OK speed up the lecture.	O
OK, it found 23 problems.	O
Or 23 sections that's curious because.	O
I don't think there's that much, pausing in here.	O
But this is really going to identify very, very small very, very short durations.	O
Now, if we go into the settings.	O
OK.	O
This is where it gets tricky right because the default of this preset is silence is anything that's below 32 decibels.	O
For more than 140 seconds.	O
I'm 140 milliseconds uh I don't know.	O
Now you'll notice you have some fixed by options shortening silence or deleting silence so this is going to shorten.	O
By 100.	O
I immediately think that's too long, but alright let's see what this preset did.	O
So just by looking it's interesting right at the end here that one looks pretty good.	O
It maybe it's OK.	O
Maybe it doesn't sound bizarre, let's take a listen main idea here is that have elongated has an automatically market way now.	O
Of course, there is a tradeoff here as sometimes want pauses today motions.	O
You do have some options to adjust that.	O
What happened all these words all kinds of things are missing right because let's go ahead and undo it?	O
Because as I mentioned to you.	O
This preset is defining silence as anything below 32 decibels well there's lots of stuff below.	O
32.	O
- 32.	O
Here's minus 32.	O
Right here.	O
So there's a lot of signal below that for more than 140 milliseconds, so some of these like little.	O
Little bits where I'm like little glottal sounds of things that are just part of natural talking.	O
It's zapping those out of there.	O
So this is where again, you know the presets are OK, but and you can try them, but I really just recommend.	O
Doing the analysis manually so let's go ahead and do that alright so let's find the levels.	O
It is now determined what it is OK.	O
Oh, and by the way and yeah, we're going to shorten silence instead of delete silence.	O
All right and maybe will do 60 milliseconds.	O
I'm able to like 80.	O
All right.	O
So let's scan.	O
OK, now it only found 4 sections.	O
That makes sense because you can see that there's 4 holes in here.	O
Let's go ahead and delete those.	O
It takes those out you can also see.	O
Now that it looks to have reserved a little bit more of the space.	O
In between those sections.	O
Which means when I play this back now?	O
The main idea here is that if you have elongated pauses.	O
You can automatically mark these and then take them away.	O
Now of course, there is a tradeoff here as sometimes you want the pauses to kind of convey mood or emotion.	O
But you do have some options to adjust that duration and make things a little smoother in the process.	O
All right.	O
And this time with the what?	CHITCHAT
What is it called smoothing shortening silence instead of deleting silence.	O
It left a little bit of that breathing room in there, so I didn't have to add back in I would.	O
Probably still add in about 20 milliseconds between that very last last bit of speech.	O
There just to make it a little more natural.	O
But if I needed to fit something for time this is an ideal way.	O
Uh to get rid of that and to just move through it, so quickly.	O
The Chris Brown this kind of stuff makes me want to start podcasting yes 'cause.	CHITCHAT
It's so, so easy and so.	CHITCHAT
Useful alright let's bounce over real quickly to some of the chats here and see if we've got additional questions coming in.	O
All right.	O
So let's see we've got.	CHITCHAT
Sergio to wreck this feature only works for addition 2020.	O
No, it is in previous versions of audition as well.	O
Although I'd recommend moving to 2020.	O
More stable.	O
And better experience most likely for you.	O
Fernando from Cologne Dan from Balma what's up, Tommy Lee Lasiter nice to see over Hey Leo.	CHITCHAT
Home is EO from Portugal Militi Oh.	CHITCHAT
Alex.	CHITCHAT
You so from Brandy and nice to see you.	CHITCHAT

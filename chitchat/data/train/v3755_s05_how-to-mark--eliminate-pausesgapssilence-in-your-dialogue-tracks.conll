Evan is asking does the diagnostic run before the effects rack yes, it does?	O
It absolutely does, yeah, so if you've got and that's a great question so just to determine some of the people.	CHITCHAT
Understand what ever was just asking so if you have effects in the effects rack.	CHITCHAT
Let's say things like compression.	O
Which are going to amplify?	CHITCHAT
Theoretically, you got a limiter on there.	O
It's going to amplify noise and silence.	O
It is doing the diagnostic scan before the effects rack.	O
Now, if you apply those effects of course, Destructively.	O
That all comes into play, then that's another example of where you would absolutely want to Rescan to find your levels.	O
But yes by default.	O
It is doing the analysis off of the raw media before any effects are applied.	O

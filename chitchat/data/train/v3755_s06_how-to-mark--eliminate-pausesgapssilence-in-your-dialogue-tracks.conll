Best you can attenuate it and more importantly, what you really ultimately want to do.	O
Is let me switch the Camera here?	CHITCHAT
So I can just talk to you?	CHITCHAT
Is?	CHITCHAT
Really accentuate the fundamentals of vocal frequencies to make it more intelligible.	O
So yes, you want to be able to somewhat.	O
Attenuate and soften and if there's like Rumble and certain elements.	O
Those you can do a fairly decent job.	O
It's not sometimes without a trade off of potential artifacting, though.	O
You know it just depends on the severity now in terms of the transitions right if you're cutting different videos and of course, that background noise.	O
Um changes.	O
If it's really radically different I mean, obviously you can.	O
Crossfade, it, you're still going to hear that there is a different.	O
There's a change in environment, so one of the techniques that I use is I'll actually fly back in.	O
Additional sound design, so like you know from our own collection.	O
In fact, we have, like sounds of the city you know.	O
It's like New York sits honking and just you know you know drills and Jackhammers and things.	O
And you add back in some common background noise at a very low level and you can even EQ.	O
It so that you're kind of taking off the high end in a bit of the Lowe's and kind of scooping out the middle.	O
Just so that you have a consistent bed of ambient noise.	O
So when you're cutting between dialogue.	O
It's less jarring and it sounds more familiar.	O
It's faking it, it's a fake little technique, but it works, great and again what you're trying to do is give the viewer the perception.	O
That this was kind of the same space, the same time of day, the same everything right this achieves that.	O
Really easily.	O
So I'd recommend that.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Oh, he means dynamic link.	CHITCHAT
He was talking about dynamic link.	CHITCHAT
Archive Pete.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Just checking back over here.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
So what was the question can I re import the file back into addition?	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure what you mean by a still frame, though.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I mean, if you're in Premier and you take a still frame from something.	O
From the video you can always send it back to audition I guess I'm still not.	O
Sure, what you what you're asking me, I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm just slow.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I definitely could be.	CHITCHAT
Tanuki from Latvia OK.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT

And it looks like that's all the questions we have.	CHITCHAT
OK, no archive Peter saying no sorry not dynamic link what's good C500?	CHITCHAT
The C 500 is definitely.	CHITCHAT

I'm going to be doing some audio streams recording streams.	CHITCHAT
Um in audition, I've gotta finish up a single supposed to finish it today to be released before the end of the year.	CHITCHAT
It's called fear of the Q-tip.	CHITCHAT
I don't know it's going to happen.	CHITCHAT
So uh.	CHITCHAT
It may only get out in 2020.	CHITCHAT

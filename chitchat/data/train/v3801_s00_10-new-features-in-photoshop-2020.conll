All right.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
That's it, OK, so back to you.	CHITCHAT
So what I love to do is take you through not only what I showed in the keynote but.	CHITCHAT
Also, some of the things I showed.	CHITCHAT
That are that weren't in the keynote that I didn't have.	CHITCHAT
The opportunity to show so let's start on my computer will switch over to the desktop.	CHITCHAT
And I've got my computer up and running I will be showing some of the same images that I used in the keynote so but will go a little bit deeper cousin, the keynote.	O
I literally only have like 7 minutes in the Max keynote to show everything.	CHITCHAT
And that's why I couldn't show everything so we're going to see some features that I didn't get a chance to show.	CHITCHAT
Go a little bit deeper on the ones I did get a chance to show an we'll go from there.	CHITCHAT
Alright so with that, said.	CHITCHAT
Let's start off with an enhancement to a feature that I introduced actually last year.	O
So one of the features I introduced last year was the fact that you did not need to hold down the shift key.	O
Anymore to do free transform to perform a free transform and have it be proportional because that was the reason you were holding down the shift key.	O
In the 1st place all these years.	O
But what if you didn't have to do it that way anymore.	O
Well, that was great for Maine and a lot of people but some people like didn't like that so.	O
The team you know within the last few months, actually introduced a preference where you could go into preferences and turn it off say no.	O
I like the old behavior go back to the way it was that's the way I always liked it.	O
Don't change things on me just just keep it going, the way it was.	O
And that's great you can turn it off in the preferences, but what if you like it.	O
Sometimes.	O
And you don't like it.	O
Other times, maybe there are times where you don't want it on and there are times where you do want it on instead of having to go switch the preference every time now, it's.	O
A It's a toggleable toggleable is that a word.	CHITCHAT
I think you can toggle in the control panel so I'm going to free transform.	O
And there's a little link symbol.	O
It's always been there, but now the maintain aspect ratio is sticky So what that means is while that is.	O
Is enabled when I do a free transform?	O
Yeah, what I do every transport there, we go.	O
It scales, it and when I uncheck that it stretches it.	O
OK, just like it is always done, but the difference now is that if I leave that unchecked.	O
It stays unchecked until I check it going again, so for people that say, Nope turn that off turn it off.	O
Just uncheck that and it will never you will always have to hold down the shift key so when it's enabled.	O
As you might guess the shift key, then does the opposite so the shift key stretches on hold down the shift key now?	O
And without the shift key I get a regular transform OK, so again.	O
I'm going to undo that and go back to it, so that's the first new thing is that this new.	O
For maintain aspect ratio is now you know it's now consistent stays sticky.	O
It stays on or off depending on what you do.	O
And Secondly the other big thing or the big problem with this in the past was.	O

That.	CHITCHAT
Even when this feature was first introduced forget whether you like it or not.	O
Uh it wasn't consistent meaning that on pixel layers.	O
You didn't have to hold down the shift key.	O
But on vector layers.	O
You did, have to hold on to 50 and it was just like.	O
Even with it on there wasn't consistent so now the team is made it.	O
More consistent across the across the board and you get to control.	O
It just by clicking on that link symbol so that's feature number one.	O
Feature #2 this is something I did showing in the keynote and it's the work capability so you have.	O
Warp for quite awhile in photo shop, but the problem with it in the past before this update was that you always when you click warp.	O
You got a grid on your transform you got a 3 by 3 square grid and that's all.	O
You ever got you couldn't add more points couldn't take points away.	O
You couldn't do anything could make a 4 by 4 grade couldn't do anything else.	O
So now you get first of all when I turn it on, I don't get any grid because it's.	O
Off by default.	O
But you can now go back to the same 3 by 3 grid, You used to get or 4 by 4 grid.	O
Or 5 by 5 grid or whatever if that's not enough.	O
You can still go in and put in your own custom grid points.	O
So I can just put in a point there and say, I need a point.	O
Wherever I need it to be.	O
I need a point there.	CHITCHAT
I need as many points as I want where I want them and that's the big thing.	O
All right, so the In addition to not only being able to create your own custom grid putting points in intersections wherever you need them to be.	O
The other thing is that you can now hold down the shift key with the wire in this mode.	O
An select multiple points now keep in mind, I have a point selected already So what may trip you up?	O
Is that when you make that selection it will deselect the point you already had selected so don't forget to go back.	O
And reselect those.	O
So if you have point selected.	O
That behavior should go back in and re select those so that I can warp that anyway, I want I can stretch it.	O
I can make it wiggle.	O
I forgot a couple points anyway, so I can go ahead and add those back in.	O
Else has it there, we go so now those are selected even though they're not visually selected.	O
It's selecting them all right there, we go.	O
Area so I gotta mall select it now, I can do whatever I want with whatever part of this flower.	O
Or object that I would want to do it with so that is the new warp capability in photo shop.	O
Your own custom grid.	O
Your own points wherever you want selecting multiple points by holding down the shift key remember to turn back on the ones you might have had.	O
Already selected if they deselect.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
That is that I'm going to switch to a different.	O
A different.	CHITCHAT
A different image here, I was going to use a different image for the next one will see if I can find it real quick.	O
Fairview this winter.	O
OK so the Next One Up is the object select tool, so I did show this in the keynote as well.	O
So there's a brand new tool, but I will mention a couple of things about it, so first of all.	O
You may not see that tool.	O
On photo shop if you customize your tool panel because when you customize your tool panel you're turning off tools you don't use.	O
And new tools don't get added automatically so when I first installed a new version of Photoshop and it.	O
It used my existing tools.	O
The object select wasn't there, I had to come down to the bottom here and I could find it this way.	O
It was in the list of tools that I had not.	O
You know had not enabled yet, but if you go back up to your edit toolbar, then you can.	O
Object select tool from the disabled tools over to your or inactive tools over to your tool panel wherever you want it to be.	O
So, therefore, it is there from that point on, and then don't forget to save this as a preset so you can always load it back in.	O
So what is the object select tool?	CHITCHAT
The object select tool and people make jokes about this, but it's true seems like with every new version of Photoshop.	O
There's a new way to make a selection and that's not a bad thing.	O
Norway since elections are such an important part of photo shop.	CHITCHAT
The more ways.	O
You have to select something.	O
The better so object select just one more way to make a selection.	O
Um with that, said there are 2 modes for this tool that starts off in the rectangle, which I have selected at the Top here.	O
And if I were to make a selection of let's say the bagel just half of the bagel.	O
It uses Adobe Sensei Artificial Intelligence machine learning to figure out that even though I made a rectangular selection around that bagel.	O
To select it says Oh you're trying to select the bagel I get it.	O

Or at least dozens of layers, I don't know bout hundreds, but at least dozens.	O
Anne what this feature is that I'm showing I just want to make sure I can just click on a couple of these yeah.	O
OK, what this feature is is it's a new way to zoom so it would be.	O
I think it's manually under the view menu perhaps.	O
Yep, it's a new option called fit layers on screen.	O
There is a keyboard equipped keyboard modifier and Click to do it.	O
Without having to go up to the menu.	O
So what it's doing is it's saying whatever layer you click on the thumbnail for.	O
Uh I will zoom to that layer So what this is for?	O
Is this beautiful image from Isabella May.	CHITCHAT
Has dozens of not hundreds of layers?	O
In it every little element is on its own layer an she?	O
Didn't do a great job of naming the layers.	O
They're like background copy background copy background copy.	O
So I would have no idea what layer of this butterfly is on because it's not called butterfly or butterfly 20.	O
'Cause there's a bunch of butterflies in here, I wouldn't know what layer what layer things are on So what this let's me do is OK.	O
This first background copy.	O
I've no idea what it is.	CHITCHAT
Let's zoom to it, so hold down the option key click on the thumbnail.	O
Oh, it's the Orange Flower.	O
So now I could name that orange.	O
Flower will say on the right because maybe it'll move but I could name that layer now OK great.	O
What's this next one background copy #8?	O
Bayes butterfly now I know what it is OK, beige.	O
Butterfly and if you are still unsure of what the layer contained 'cause I don't know if it's the butterfly or believe.	O
Or this background or the orange thing you can hold down your option key and then also isolate it.	O
Just click in a little I so you know exactly what that layer contains because if you're still not sure.	O
You can also I always isolate.	O
The layer to see exactly what that layer contains that's now not so orange as I thought it was more.	O
Pinkish reddish, but anyway, you get that no depends on the tent got it OK.	O
So that is the zoom to layer capability, which under the view menu is officially called fit layers on screen.	O
All right Next up?	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
This is one that I did not show in the keynote so OK.	O
So now we're moving off the keynote stuff that was pretty much the stuff I showed in the keynote.	CHITCHAT
Let's go grab a different image here, I'm going to go in and grab.	O
Uhm I think this is the one I want yeah, OK so Penguins.	O
Alright so I'm going to load a selection just for the sake of time select.	O
Load selection an will do the lapping OK, so I didn't laughing when I got it selected now.	O
An I'm just in the background.	O
So if I hit my delete or backspace.	O
Key you know that that does a content aware fill?	O
You also know that a content aware fill is only as good as the surrounding pixels.	O
So, sometimes if there's something to close.	O
To the object you're trying to select.	O
You end up.	O
Pulling or trying to delete you end up pulling some of that object in so here it looks it.	O
Do delete content aware fill.	O
Hit OK.	O
Wait, a few seconds and ask what starts to happen start, saying Oh I'll fill it in with the other Penguin.	O
Well, that's not great, it's not we want it.	O
There were all kinds of tricks.	O
I had a video way back.	O
When to show how to mass temporarily.	O
The thing you didn't want to come over.	O
And then do the content aware fill and then it would then you turn mask off and bring back the other element.	O
Well, they've worked on this and content aware fill workspace workspace is not new came out last year.	O
Also didn't make it into the keynote, but they've enhanced it this year as well.	CHITCHAT
So let's go to instead of just doing the delete.	O
Or backspace go to your edit menu.	O
Come down to content aware fill which this is actually the work space for it.	O
And what it does now is it will there's an option to auto.	O
Basically auto Detect what shouldn't come over.	O
In other words, auto detect what the subject is and it's showing me a preview of what it's already done.	O
So it's already done it's already going to do the right thing I would do is click OK and it.	O
Automatically did the content aware fill.	O
Ann got rid of the other Penguin without pulling over the one next to it, so the content aware fill workspace.	O
Was there last year?	CHITCHAT
What's new this year?	O
Is the auto instead of you having to paint and tell it.	O
What not to bring over it will do a good job of auto detecting so that it can figure out what not to bring over.	O
And then you go from there.	O
OK.	O
Next up, and hang on let me do one more thing real quick here.	O
All right.	CHITCHAT

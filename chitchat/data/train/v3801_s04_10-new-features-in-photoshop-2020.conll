That is cool alright.	CHITCHAT
I agree Jeremy over on Behance.	CHITCHAT
We grab one more thing over here, real quick.	O
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Da Da Da Da.	CHITCHAT
Alright, OK, so Next up?	CHITCHAT
The next one that was featured #6 enhanced content aware workspace feature #7 is a little thing, but it goes a long way for people that create smart.	O
Objects.	O
So for example, let Maine.	CHITCHAT
Let's duplicate the layer actually know what let's undo it for a second.	O
Oops I undo.	CHITCHAT
Undo put it back.	O
Let's go back up to that fill constant warfare workspace.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I want to change the output to a new layer so In other words.	O
Fill it in but put it on a new layer when you do that, so click OK does the same thing, but I get a new layer?	O
Are great the reason?	CHITCHAT
I wanted that new layer was so that I can then?	O
Convert these 2 layers into a smart object, so something not new you been doing that for years.	O
When I convert them into a smart object.	O
The and if I double click on that, Smart Object I get to edit those 2 layers.	O
So it opened up a new window.	O
But those 2 layers in America close that window then I'm back to the original smart object.	O
What's new is you now have the ability if you right click?	O
Right click you have the ability to.	O
Convert back to layers so you can take this smart, object that you've worked on bill did non destructive stuff, too.	O
And then you could say at the end OK.	O
I'm done with it being a smart object.	O
I don't need it to be a smart object anymore and before your option was flattened it.	O
Which obviously don't want to do so convert back to layers will convert it into layers again?	O
So that I now have the ability.	O
To work on them as layer, so that is featured #7 convert smart objects back to layers or 2 layers in the 1st place.	O
All Right This is another one that's this one.	O
Actually, I did not know about at first because I was kind of paying attention.	O
Other things, but A new organization for our new improved preset panels.	O
So how many of you are used the gradient hold your hand up.	O
Yes, I've used gradients before gradients are awesome.	O
But if you remember the gradient panel.	O
Wasn't awesome it was this thing up here?	CHITCHAT
That kind of this like scrolling through them You're trying to figure them out.	O
Now, if you go to your window menu or things like gradients.	O
There's a whole new gradient.	O
Panel with all kinds of great presets in it, so if you like Purples.	O
You like pinks you like Reds.	O
You like Greys, you got a ton of gradient presets.	O
All there ready to go ready for you to click on ready for you to do stuff with so for example.	O
I can click through the gradient on what used to be the Old Penguin Alright, but you get the idea.	O
So, just check out the presets.	O
I'll do I didn't want for gradients.	O
Here's another shocker.	CHITCHAT
Here's one that really will be useful.	O
In addition to gradients is shapes so if you go under window menu and come down to shapes.	O
For the first time you've got a this a massive.	O
This massive massive massive hang on not looking at the right way.	O
Oh, there, we go you got this massive massive Library of shapes.	O
Including more shapes so you've got leaf trees.	O
You've got wild animals.	O
You've got boats.	O
You got Flowers and I think I need to reset mine.	O
Restore default shapes let's do that.	O
Yeah, 'cause I'm missing some categories.	O
I believe hang on.	CHITCHAT
Still, missing some categories alright.	CHITCHAT
Oh, there, OK, so they came back now, so both Flowers wild animals leave trees.	O
Fill out the others, the same ones as duplicated somehow.	O
I need to reset this panel.	O
Store import anyway, there should be another set of categories here that you'll probably have I gotta go figure out where mine are?	O
But one of these shapes for so for example, if I wanted to bring in a different wild animal into the scene.	O
Do I have anything that's snowbound.	O
Probably not so let's let's do the far opposite let's bring bring a camel.	O
We're going to vector camel shape that again is doing an ice free transform without me holding down the shift key perfectly.	O
Without perfectly maintaining aspect ratio, so the vector shapes are there.	O
As organized panels just like the gradients so you have the gradients shapes and patterns take advantage of those panels now.	O

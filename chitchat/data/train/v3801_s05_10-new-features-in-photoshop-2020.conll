For organization an for working inside of Photoshop.	O
Alright in that vector shape of course, those shapes come in as their own layer so you can do it.	O
Whatever you want with Next up?	CHITCHAT
That was number 8.	O
Here's one that's kind of like.	CHITCHAT
Just I've always done it the old way so I didn't expect to do it the new way.	O
The new way of making an animated GIF so if you wanted to make an animated jump in the past, you go to your timeline.	O
You'd create a video timeline from your layers.	O
You could go in you could specify which layer is going to be where.	O
Hang on let's see here.	CHITCHAT
That data out 'cause it world up OK, there, we go toilet down.	CHITCHAT
So I could say first come.	O
Show me the background.	O
Then show me the camel so let's bring the Camera out in time.	O
So it's basically like working with the video.	O
An background copy so for example, when I play this.	O
The camel would just appear and it's a simple to layer thing it's not going to be.	O
Very exciting.	CHITCHAT
But if you want to make that an animated jif in the past for whatever you did on that timeline.	O
You would go up and use the legacy safer web so you do a say about or actually you do an export.	O
Safer web and safer web gave you the choice in the past of working.	O
Our exporting out of Jeff and then whatever size you want it to be.	O
And that still works, but what's better is going up to your file menu now.	O
Choosing save as.	O
Onto your computer an simply choosing jif.	O
For the first time so if I were to say that out, as a.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
As an animator drift, I get all my animation controls in it right here for me to do what I wanted to do with it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Oh let's see I want to make this.	CHITCHAT
What version?	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
So the ability to say about an animated Jeff directly.	O
As well as this one check one more thing here.	O
Don't don't bother saving your timeline out as an image if I just want to make sure I wasn't missing one more thing.	O
OK, so easier save as GIF from photo shop, so that's #9, #10 and this is one that.	O
I expect you guys to use kind of going forward is going to be a big thing.	CHITCHAT
And that is when you want your photo shop documents on your other devices.	O
So we came out with Photoshop on the iPad version 1.	O
Getting started.	O
And if I wanted to work on this Penguin some more on that.	O
On the iPad well instead of me, having to save it to my computer or figure out a transfer to my iPad.	O
We have cloud docs now built in so when I do a save as you saw the dialog box briefly.	O
It gave me the option of just uh.	O
Hey, how to do this window, which you can turn off but save it to my computer or save to cloud doc so you still can.	O
Of course, save things your computer work offline do things like you always did.	O
But you are now also have the option to save to cloud.	O
Docs So what does that mean when I choose save to cloud docs?	CHITCHAT
I get the option to create a folder put things organized in the way.	O
I want and save them to the cloud.	O
So when I choose this.	O
And it saved.	O
It will save that locally 1st and then upload it to creative cloud when I have an Internet connection.	O
What does that mean it means that now when I go to my other computer?	O
Or my iPad.	O
And the launch photo shop.	O
And I choose file open on any device now.	O
An I say go to my cloud docs to open versus my computer that Penguin and any other documents.	O
I've saved to the cloud will be there for me to open and work on.	O
So that's that's the way that.	CHITCHAT
You will work back and forth between platforms, especially mobile and desktop but even your other computers if you.	O
Don't want to sink them to a drop box or something like that, so still can work locally don't expect that to change.	O
So now I have the ability to work in Cloud Docs as well so those are my 10 things.	O
That are new.	O
In photo shop so quick recap.	O
Constant consistent transform uncheck recheck the box, which ever way.	O
You want the new warp capability, which we looked at as well.	O
The new object select tool.	O
Remove background with a single click of a button, which does 2 step process.	O
The zoom to layer capability, which is great for when you need to see what's on the layer, especially when you get a document from someone else.	O
Uh we enhance.	O
Oops wrong one be enhanced.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Content aware fill workspace convert smart objects to layers.	O
Improve presets for gradients patterns and shapes.	O

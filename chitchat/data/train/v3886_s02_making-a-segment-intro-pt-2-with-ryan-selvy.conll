Miller banner is really nice too.	O
Let's try that out.	O
So what is happening here will activate all 10 fonts?	O
Because I am lazy.	CHITCHAT
And don't like that have to go through 1 by one.	O
You'll also see I accidentally trying to click these like 1000 times.	O
So the cool thing is now that we have it is automatically syncs.	O
And go over and Goodnight Miller Banner.	O
Just sit right there, if you saw me hover per second over Top of this move tool.	O
One thing I probably should keep in mind, though.	O
In fact, this is going to be on Top of.	O
This checkered.	O
So it might be a little too hard to read.	O
Yeah, we might be better off just using us San Serif.	O
After all that work.	O
'cause I had forgotten that I was going to put it on Top of.	O
The checkerboard, so we'll just go back real quick.	O
Or flip through will just go to some sand Seraphim again, I Cynthia.	O
I connect this forma.	O
This is a little bit like future, A.	O
I just did it again.	O
So I will do that, we're going to go over to form a.	O
Now let's see how well that is.	CHITCHAT
Viewable on Top of that and it is.	O
Let's see actually if all of it is.	O
No, not that not the photo shop.	O
So maybe we could move it down a bit and this isn't things that we actually have to figure out now because when we go in.	O
2.	CHITCHAT
Actually create it will be able to move these assets around freely.	O
Perhaps we, accidentally stretched it, you never want to do that.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Let's say with Ryan Sally.	O
Or might even actually just do that and then just have.	O
This with Ryan Selby pop up.	O
On a checkerboard would be kinda cute.	O
And then just blue blue.	O
Yeah, that's what we're going to do.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Space it accordingly.	O
I'm going to make this lighter, but I know that it will make it harder to read.	O
Now, but it should be fine.	O
And then is there any Hey Colin how's your?	CHITCHAT
How's your Tuesday going man?	CHITCHAT
You having a good time.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you're not Max right you're just.	CHITCHAT
Hanging out.	CHITCHAT
At the Adobe headquarters in New York City.	CHITCHAT
I got a little into it, there and I.	CHITCHAT

Um.	CHITCHAT
Move them off to the side.	O
So I'm actually going to just put them to the very Top.	O
Move it off to the side, so you can lock all of them.	O
We don't need these them anymore.	O
What are you getting into today ameb anything fun anything cool?	CHITCHAT
Beep Bop Beep Boop.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to see if I get an increase.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Going to mess with me, though I will tell you that, but I'm going to go to my settings.	O
And try to increase the text size because I'm blind.	O
I.	CHITCHAT
Size what are we talking about here you guys?	CHITCHAT
Straight 5.	O
That didn't change anything that must be changing the actual.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
OK, so appearance of black that's not important I mean, it's important, but Like.	O
User interface.	O
Changes will take effect in the next time you launch illustrator.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Wow.	CHITCHAT
Folders have to deal with it.	O
Or we can restart real quick.	O
I'm going to save and I'm going to exit real quick and then hop right back into it in about 5 seconds.	O
It's kind of a little closer and press OK.	O
Clear clipboard.	O
Ignore that thank you.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
And we're back.	CHITCHAT
Oh, much better, I can read things they don't have to squint everywhere.	O
That's great.	CHITCHAT
What kind of?	CHITCHAT
Stuff that you do day today by the way.	CHITCHAT
I'm at.	CHITCHAT

The bounding box is good to go.	CHITCHAT
Oh, and thank you for appreciating the.	CHITCHAT
The streaming animations so I'm glad you like them.	CHITCHAT
That's kind of what we're about to get into right now.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually I think I'm probably going to keep all the Top navigation together.	O
Just like that 'cause it's going to be way, too much of a headache.	CHITCHAT
To break that down and then on break it down.	O
Transparency is an accurate.	O
There should be.	CHITCHAT
Will probably recreate this in all honesty.	O
This part right here.	O
The title in after effects?	O
And then for transparency.	O
I kind of wanted to make this into a rasterized file.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Because it'll kill my computer probably way more than it needs to.	CHITCHAT
So, an easy way to do that.	CHITCHAT
It's actually not look at the new little splash page.	O
I opened that but I forgot that you can just collect for export.	O
Of just the transparency and you can go and.	O
Just scale of One X and go in here and we're going to go to.	O
Quiktrips intro.	O
No, I said here I select folder.	O
I'm going to export.	O
Oh, it's already in there boom done.	O
But you know, so will still keep it.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Give part of the document in case we want to come back at it, but it's super not important.	O

That's good to go.	O
Tools panel.	O
I'm going to kind of divide this up, but not as much as the other ones is going to be similar kind of to what we were doing at the Top here.	O
An and once again that's just a convenience.	O
Because after effects will divide it a little bit, but I don't want to have an individual layer.	O
For every single tool 'cause that would just be maddening.	O

Looks like I have to increase the size of everything might be helpful, too, sometimes like you can do this, where you can go and you can actually just size up the com.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Bring everything down and then I'll just bump everything up.	O
Sometimes it faster, but then other times, it's also faster just to open the document.	CHITCHAT

Right so there's this little buddy, it says.	O
Make sure that it's vector pretty much.	O
So it'll tighten everything up.	O
Uh it will also make the computer work, a little bit harder.	CHITCHAT
But that's fine.	CHITCHAT
It should be OK, it should be.	O
It's a big boy it's a big girl it's OK.	CHITCHAT
But now when I pop it in here.	O
Because you're making this little tiny are now because.	O

Then I can easily click.	O
Once they want.	O
And I'll just bring them over here.	O
I can align them.	O
What you can do also is you can do?	O

And that's helpful for when you kind of want to.	O
Manipulate a shape.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
Like this.	O

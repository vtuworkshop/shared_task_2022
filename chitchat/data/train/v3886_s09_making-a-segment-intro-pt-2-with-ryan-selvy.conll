I like to go in and just kind of.	O
Make everything.	O
100%.	O
So that I can then.	O
Go back.	O
Work backwards to the idea of.	O
Then I saw easy ease we can also go into.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
The graph editor if we want to mess with the.	O
Anymore of The easy ease, but for the most part, easy ease will give me what I want.	CHITCHAT
What are you doing?	CHITCHAT
Oh, OK, so the.	CHITCHAT
It's getting a little weird because I didn't move my anchor point.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Over to the center, so it's	O
Confused.	O
And it's Scaling up from referencing the middle when it should be.	O
Scaling out referencing right in here now this can be tricky because it will then continue to stay in that area.	O
Unless I add a keyframe to it, and the position kind of gets a little wonky with the 2.	O
Such as something to be like hardness, and of the program could only do so much as far as like.	O
Read your mind so just throwing to show your work is kind of how I.	O
Think of it and the program will work with you.	O
It wants to do the right thing.	O
So let's check that out, let's see what that looks like.	O
Pop pop pop.	CHITCHAT
So right around.	O
Here.	O
We can introduce this guy.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
We can actually just rather than.	CHITCHAT
Doing the same thing that we just did.	CHITCHAT
We can move the anchor point up here and then mess with the scaling?	O
So that It then appears.	O
To to grow with it, but in reality, we're just kind of shrinking in.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
I'll be like poop poop poop poop.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I like the scale down like that instead.	O
Let's try to just do a like a?	O
A pop up for it.	O
So we're going to have it going to undo and have.	O
The scaling for the anchor point being the middle again.	O
That way.	O
We can do a quick little pop.	O
I don't even think that we need to have it be subtle.	O
I think it could actually just be a very kind of jarring.	O
Loud pop.	CHITCHAT
I mean, not that during.	CHITCHAT
This might take too long for.	CHITCHAT

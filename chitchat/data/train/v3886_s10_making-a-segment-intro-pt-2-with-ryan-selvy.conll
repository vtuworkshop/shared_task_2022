This introduction.	CHITCHAT
What I'm doing right away when I'm doing it?	CHITCHAT
I'm holding them all down and then I hold down.	O
Alt or option, depending on what software you're using?	O
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Then a kind of has them all work together.	O
I feel like that's like a good spot.	O
Now I could do something I could pre compose.	O
It just so it's a little bit more organized.	O
I might do that I might undo it later.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
For now.	CHITCHAT
Touch is pretty composer.	O
So we can just select the 2:00 and then do pre compose and I'll call that.	O
Main window.	O
OK.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Next we'll do the.	O
Tool panel.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I'm actually going to go.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to make that it's own.	O
Twitter to return to tell them I want to say new conference selection.	CHITCHAT
Now the nice thing about this.	CHITCHAT
Is we're going to take all the other tools?	O
I'm going to put him in here as well, and they're not going to necessarily be.	O
Properly.	O
Ingested.	O
Bye.	CHITCHAT
Go to file under the same thing where we scale, it up.	O
It'll make it a lot nicer.	CHITCHAT
Um so descript scale competition scale composition.	O
And we're just going to scale it by 3.	O
Ann Ann once again, you'll notice that it is blurry, but that's only because we haven't activated the vector layers.	O
So now once we?	O
Activate that vector layer.	O
We should be fine.	O
And then go up.	O
I get put it along the Top.	O
Make sure that it's aligned.	O
Does it have the blue background right there that you're seeing?	O
Is?	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
Composition background being.	O
Represented.	O
Take the tool presets.	O
Them up a little bit.	CHITCHAT
That line, these up just as they are.	O
Holding down shift.	O
We still have?	CHITCHAT
You little squirts over here.	O
In the folder.	O
Over here now I'm going to go back and reference.	O
Kind of what we have going on over here just to see.	O
Now it looks to Maine.	CHITCHAT
That this isn't perfectly lined up in the same way so.	O
I'm going to copy and paste it.	O
And surprisingly.	O
It's actually pretty close.	O
Now you're going to run into an issue here.	O
Where?	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
These haven't been scales.	O

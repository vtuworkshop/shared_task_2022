But what you can do in this little trick.	O
Is you can go to a null object?	O
You can add the null object.	O
And assign all of these.	O
To the null object?	O
And when you go and you scale up the null object.	O
It will then.	O
Bring all these up as well.	O
Without them referencing their center.	O
And then You can go.	O
And you can make it not reference the null object and you delete an object.	O
But Vala.	CHITCHAT
You still have?	O
Your scaled objects.	O
So security work around.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
I am going to go in here and I'm going to create a.	O
Shape from this.	O
Because I want to expand.	O
So at the very Top.	O
Not a breath and talking so much.	CHITCHAT
OK take a breath.	CHITCHAT
And you'll see in here if we go all the way to our content.	O
We have 2 different groups.	O
In our two groups are the background and the Aeros.	O
I don't want to separate my group for the arrow, so anything that I work on is going to be in this transform tool.	O
Rather than diving into it.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
This, however, I'm going to the path and I'm going to adjust the path.	O
Because this is where we get to.	O
Select the keyframes for the individual path.	O
And kind of extend it so.	O
Will do something like this?	O
Having expand.	O
Much faster than that.	O
This is really amazing your knowledge of the program is so expensive.	CHITCHAT
Mazing also extensions really great picture and of course, an if you want me to slow down at anything.	CHITCHAT
An and explain or go further into depth or show different like approach to something.	CHITCHAT
Please do not hesitate to reach out and ask.	CHITCHAT
I love this program.	CHITCHAT
Uh.	CHITCHAT
And I've been messing with it for.	CHITCHAT
A handful of years, so I'm excited to share any information that I can.	CHITCHAT
Now I accidentally just put the key frames at the wrong location for that because this transform.	O
Well then.	CHITCHAT
You have your Contacts in your transform your transform.	O
Controls everything that's in this layer, but we don't want to do that because we have 2 different groups in this layer.	O
So we want to go under the Group One transform and then position.	O
And I think the place to get skipped up a little bit.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
It's a good thing to.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to.	O
Go ahead.	O
Move this position over to the right and so I'm only moving the Aeros.	O
Open easy ease on that.	O
Which will just kind of ease the?	O
The approach.	O
All right, so if we get rid of everything else.	O
This is what will be seeing.	O
And we might want to move that back a bit because.	O
Since this is coming out of nowhere.	O
And we're going to want to probably just.	O
This path	O
Which is?	CHITCHAT
This bad boy.	CHITCHAT
Send me to do that.	O
Area and this is what you want.	O
Make a little bit thinner, so that the starting point doesn't feel as just daunting of A.	O

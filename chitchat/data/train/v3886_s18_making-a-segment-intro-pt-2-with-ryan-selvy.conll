Rate.	O
But not at the same time, so I'm going to individually give them all the same scaling and mess with the scaling.	O
So that they are equal, but then I'll go and I'll disperse them properly.	O
And I will make sure that not only are they highlighted but I'm also at that point in the timeline so.	O
That, it properly affects it.	O
So at 3:20.	O
Now will do 3:30.	O
I'm going to make all of these guys 0% scale.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
So, like that.	O
But now with that in mind, we can then stack these and there are.	O
Admittedly.	CHITCHAT
Admittedly there are some plugins like motion 2.	O
That will automatically do this stacking for you.	O
Hi, however, once again.	CHITCHAT
Had them at my old job.	CHITCHAT
And I.	CHITCHAT
No longer work there.	CHITCHAT
So after all, the manually it'll take like 2 or 3 minutes.	CHITCHAT
There's worse things in life.	CHITCHAT
I mean, we just went through, and individually.	O
Named.	O
And organized.	O
All of these layers and to me that's a little bit more mind numbing then.	O
Stacking.	O
Alright Well, you're heading home.	CHITCHAT
I got, I got, I had a good day at work, man.	CHITCHAT
Talk to you later.	CHITCHAT
G and I'll catch on your stream in a bit.	CHITCHAT
Cheers.	CHITCHAT
Big claps.	CHITCHAT
Cheat claps.	CHITCHAT
And now you're not on Behance, Max, but are you.	CHITCHAT
He's streaming later today.	CHITCHAT
Me.	CHITCHAT
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Any idea of what are you just thinking?	CHITCHAT
Just random doodles.	CHITCHAT
Have you been working any big projects lately?	CHITCHAT
I've seen your stream work, but I don't know if I've ever seen.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I've seen so that you posted.	CHITCHAT
But do you have any like consistent pieces of work looking like I do like comics?	CHITCHAT
Is I consider like my consistent?	CHITCHAT
Would you like any like character illustrations or something?	CHITCHAT
Let's take too long I felt that takes too long.	CHITCHAT
My takes too long.	CHITCHAT
Alright I'll just change it down to one rather than 2 for everything.	O
A little bit of a process but that's fine.	O
Easy thing is that you can just do this now.	O
Rather than continuously.	O
Did you ever going to chiptune?	CHITCHAT
I love chiptune back in like 2009.	CHITCHAT
Let me now that's so weird kid.	CHITCHAT
I don't think so.	CHITCHAT
I don't know it doesn't have to be on the hands.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Then that's around with it, you inspired me to comic also do James Art school assignments and sometimes people ask me to make emotes.	CHITCHAT
Amazing.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I know you gotta help me out with my email.	CHITCHAT
It's because the emails that I have.	CHITCHAT
To just not as legible I want them to be more legible.	CHITCHAT
And it's so hard when they're tiny.	CHITCHAT
Also I'd love to see your comic.	CHITCHAT

All right guys welcome back today, I'm going to be doing some texturing this time, using substance painter.	O
Cut my model here, so we just threw together.	O
It's a little cart for the community evil, setting what kind of village so.	O
And we're just going to use sort rarely have in painter here.	O
Maybe I'll happen to designer if their stuff I need but.	CHITCHAT
Let's get started so.	CHITCHAT
First things 1st is I have this set as 2 different texture sets.	O
I've got one for the cart and one for the wheels and also the handles in a little bit more.	O
Yeah, F3 here, I can pull up my UV's.	O
This is the current I have it split up a lot more than I would usually.	O
Usually I wouldn't work with so many seams but.	O
We try something different this time.	CHITCHAT
Specifically, I have 'em all separated based by.	O
What type of material would be inward natural seems to be anyway so?	O
If you look up here.	O
All these panels are these pounds right here.	O
And since these panels would most likely be separate material like in the real world to these right here.	O
There be like a Seven piece of wood so I'm thinking like planks going horizontally and then.	O
All right here.	O
You know little beams going up and down and support.	O
So I kept them separated there first thing like to do any any model is too big color Maps.	O
You working with 2K.	O
So 2048.	O
It's it's non destructive so you can only change it later.	O
Change your output and ourselves.	O
You're working sites, with that.	O
I don't have a high Poly mesh for this one.	O
So I'm just going to say bagel texture sets.	O
Just going to go through it's going to give me or ambient occlusion and whole bunch of other.	O
Maps like the curvature in position that'll be good for.	O
Using generators and things like that.	O
Already.	O
See it when I had to meet all their Maps if I had a high Poly it would.	O
Big that detail into the normal but I don't for this, who it won't pop.	O
The wheels back on and you can see.	O
Now you just the tiniest bit of shading here was from the ambient occlusion.	O
My friend I really just helps make it pop so.	CHITCHAT
We're just going to start I think we started the actual card, so I can hide my wheels right here in my texture set.	O
Now, almost exclusively work in failures.	CHITCHAT
So you're going to pull up a wood material.	O
But if you have wants to choose from.	O
Honey over these planks, I got 2.	O
I can't remember which is which.	CHITCHAT
We're medizin designer.	O
While ago.	CHITCHAT

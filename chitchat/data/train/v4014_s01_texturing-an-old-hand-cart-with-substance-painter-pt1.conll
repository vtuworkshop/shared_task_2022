A number of Black Mesa little height at all.	O
I think I will start with the inside here.	O
If I select this little checkerboard pattern that will do it by.	O
I can.	CHITCHAT
Mask by shell so pressing actually can see switches between black and white.	O
Its weight that pass through the Black Mask obviously so.	O
Fylkir.	CHITCHAT
My my you VS.	CHITCHAT
Whenever I use the shell, it just does this entire bit.	O
There's also I think is object so this would do everything.	O
That's one object, then you can also do it like by face.	O
Like that.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I'm just gonna do this, or that.	O
You know, and this one OK.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to have separate layers for this and this one.	O
I guess these 2 in this one 'cause this one is laid out.	O
Yeah, so these 2 are laid out horizontally in this ones vertically.	O
Sort of rotate I'll show you what I mean, Skype that.	O
Go into the material here and rotate it 90 degrees.	O
I mean, we're going to throw the scale.	O
There we go, we get some tiling here.	O
Looks pretty good.	CHITCHAT
You don't quite line up here so I'm going to.	O
Through each one of these separate.	O
Find.	O
Under scaling we like first.	O
I know if I if I press CI can switch through the different Maps.	O
So the base color.	O
And am to go back to material see everything in mind.	O
Show.	O
Think 10s pretty good scale.	O
I was going to say this.	O
Do any fill air.	O
Actually, I'm going to.	O
Just copy this failure.	O
Likeness.	O
Hide.	O
OK.	O
Here, I can just.	O
Surrounded the offset try to get lined up.	O
Now I can also uses a trip planner.	O
It will give me here we go.	O
We see make it easier to see.	O
No pun intended.	O
No one's here in here.	O
Actually.	O
This change my scaling little bit, yeah.	O
Maybe.	CHITCHAT
It's not perfect, as I need to be there.	O
And we can do that one more time for this side over here.	O
Shut this time, we're going to be rotating it.	O
There we go.	O
No this isn't.	O
That's good enough for now.	CHITCHAT
Go ahead and throw all these in a folder.	O

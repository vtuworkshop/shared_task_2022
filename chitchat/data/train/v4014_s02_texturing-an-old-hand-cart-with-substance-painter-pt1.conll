Sorry about the name later.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
All this bump here this normal's a little bit intense mean to dial it back, I can go up here.	O
And switch it to normal and then.	O
Just going to do it now.	O
Doing the right one wanna do this.	O
We need to add A.	O
You filled it only effects that can be hype what I'm looking at here.	O
So if you are.	CHITCHAT
See height.	O
Actually can check here.	O
Yeah, OK.	CHITCHAT
Sing multiply.	O
Yeah, there, we go, we still multiplying that all.	O
She's at the flat knees out just a little bit.	O
Too extreme my default.	O
It's alright.	CHITCHAT
What is hot today?	CHITCHAT
Very warm.	CHITCHAT
Alright let's do this one now.	O
Not to worry about.	CHITCHAT
By the color, I think it's an alright color.	O
He would tell us the loan on the outside little more well let.	O
That's the new here same thing.	O

At that scaling here.	O
Submit Lurg.	O

My bed.	CHITCHAT
I am seeing like a lot of detailed tile here worry about that when we get to like.	O
Add dirt and grime and stuff.	O
Once again.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to come down these sites.	O
Little too extreme.	O
I could go in and put a parameter for that.	O
In the material itself, which is not a bad idea.	O
But for now since I have this way.	O
It's not too hard just touch effect height normal.	O
Once we get to multiply there, we go.	O
It would be better to have a slider in the material but.	O
This gets the job done.	O
Now I'm thinking.	CHITCHAT
I don't want this all to be the same shade something this raining here.	O
Maybe a darker wood or maybe even.	O
Make a metal or something totally different.	O
I'm thinking these little bits are going to be like iron rebar.	O
Maybe we have more raw wood for this insider.	O
But biscuits start naming here nor is going to confuse fast, so this is just going to be the.	O
Kurt lips.	O
For bed.	O

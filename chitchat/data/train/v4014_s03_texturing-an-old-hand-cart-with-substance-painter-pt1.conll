6 Santa sleigh now now we're going for so I'm going to throw down.	O
Don't know.	CHITCHAT
Don't know.	CHITCHAT
Do a lot of materials, we can work with here.	O
So it can turn Iran.	CHITCHAT
Rough.	O
Something a lot darker than that.	O
I think I think I might stick with would be honest is supposed to be like.	O
The peasants card anyways, it seems like unlikely to have.	O
A lot of medals or anything like that, so let's go back.	O
CR Woods, OK, so this plank material, I made?	O
The size down here.	O
I know it's not well name, but this is supposed to affect the gap in the planks.	O
So I have, I have 2 in here.	O
I need to delete one.	O
One has it 1 doesn't have it working?	O
I think it's the other one.	O
Yeah, here, we go there, we go and now it's got no.	O
So these lines right here.	O
But separate planks now that's all gone need to mess with the scale here.	O
I think maybe it darker wood.	O
I don't think I gave it any color control, so.	O
The few things we can do here just like the height, adjust we can do the same thing, but with color.	O
So if I throw on like just a black color, I can tell it to multiply.	O
No.	O
Ask through now.	CHITCHAT
The scroll through see.	O
Now you know multiply my pH.	O
I just need to tell yeah here we go OK.	O
And then I just needed throw on.	O
I can copy this mask detail here.	O
Copy mask and then paste it too.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
And now this is ask acting as just just multiplying that black color.	O
Now by the wood so just overall darkens it in a few different ways.	O
You can go about doing it with just my way.	CHITCHAT
and I like how it works.	CHITCHAT
So we don't have a ton of texture resolution.	O
On these railings.	O
We look here, I think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's this over here, maybe.	O
Used to.	O
It's not me.	CHITCHAT
It's not nothing but that's the entire thing rap so.	O
Link one faces like.	O
He.	CHITCHAT
Not very large.	O
Yeah, so this is the Top face here.	O
And this is the bottom.	O
Some can mess around.	O
It was too much.	O
Eat till I get that early should add A.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we can do that for a time, but I can go back and look at the material in designer and maybe have a modifier for these not straight here.	O
Or, a little parameter that I can change that we can just turn them off 'cause right now, I think they're just.	O
A little too extreme.	O
If you just bring this, yeah, OK.	O
Since I didn ask out this high to test is just affecting all layers below it right now.	O
I really should add make a note of that, but I should add.	O
I had adjustment true for the material that we can just do it straight shooting.	O
The thing without having any extra layers, not hard to do.	O
Just.	CHITCHAT
Look at this from as many angles that can.	O
Get a fence so I think.	O
Once again this is going a different direction.	O
And if you think about it logically it would it really make sense for them to cut the wood in this direction like something if you chop down a tree and you need.	O
A long piece, she would cut it, I guess vertically as opposed to horizontally so.	O
I'm just going to mask this out, not that one.	O
Now this one yes.	O

And we'll just cut paste that.	O
And this time it's clear that mask.	O
And again here and rotated 90.	O
And there, we go.	O
The highest resolution, but Gets the job done.	O
And, of course for final renders you can only just change it just like this.	O
They can pump up to 4.	O
Kane just because of how it's all all set up and how substance painter works.	O
It preserves all that detail.	O
You don't know it's not stretching anything.	O
So that just means everything is just gonna be that much more crisp and see.	O
I don't usually work in 4K.	O
Cause your computer to chug issue depending on your specs and all that.	O
But I will do my renders sometimes.	O
In 4K and Quick good I'm just going to go ahead and name.	O
Use.	O
These layers before I forget what they do.	O
This is my real April Durkin.	O
This will just be.	O
Real.	O
Sites seeds and Rail.	O
Black.	O
Again, we can throw these all into a folder or proper.	O
And just color rails and I'm thinking about it, I'm going to go ahead throw down to save.	O
Try to keep everything organized but.	O
So many folders.	O
I gotta get like proper naming scheme going.	O
Substance painter.	O
There we go.	O
In toilet cart.	O
Turn off.	O
Boot enough alright.	O
I don't want to put the word on this side, but maybe.	O
You know what you're going to do that on the same thinking.	O
We follow the same scheme here with these panels right here.	O
It'll be like the lighter color would that I have over here and then these beams.	O
Maybe the darker one.	O
I think that'll give it a nice contrast.	O
Let's just go ahead and see.	O
Norman testing it out.	O
Second, one, I don't know maybe who knows their down 90.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT

Could do quick fix.	O
And see how the mall lined up nicely here.	O
Except.	O
Which two is it anyways and just?	O
It's just.	CHITCHAT
Throughout a mask.	O
In case these 2 middle ones.	O
You still	CHITCHAT
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK, yeah, this was too.	CHITCHAT

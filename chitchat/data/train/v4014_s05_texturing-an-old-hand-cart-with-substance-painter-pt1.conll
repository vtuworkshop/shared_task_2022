I'm going to hop over in my modeling program.	O
And just rotate the issue vise and I should just be able to bring it.	O
Right back in and.	CHITCHAT
Plug and play no problems.	CHITCHAT
Which I'll be right back?	CHITCHAT
OK, we should be good to go so I'm just going to pop up here and say.	O
Oh, it's project configuration risking change the file expert to hear.	O
Ulting goes point plan then.	O
Nothing will break yeah, there, we go.	O
Nothing broke.	O
Now let's see if anything fixed.	O
Early fixed.	O
Oh, it is beautiful look at that easy fix do second fixed too.	O
Awesome OK.	CHITCHAT
I know how to do that I could have gone in and on the thing with separate layers, but you know.	O
Extra work and all.	O
It's just a little neater little cleaner.	O
Little less of a hassle.	O
Well, so I can do that might as well.	O
Cool.	CHITCHAT
Cool, cool cool.	CHITCHAT
Poopoo Doo Doo.	CHITCHAT
Beautiful.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
This mask is all sorts of funny just going to clear it.	O
And I'm just going to grab it all.	O
From the UV's here.	O
Much easier.	CHITCHAT
And look at this now, my planks lineup.	O
Perfectly just great.	O
Fantastic.	O
Now you only can do is these I used the wrong one again.	O
First, one.	O
Yeah, OK.	CHITCHAT
We can increase the gap that I thought it was a little weak.	O
We got something like that there we go.	O
How much better?	CHITCHAT
I like it.	CHITCHAT
Looking good.	CHITCHAT
Very nice indeed.	O
One thing I would say about this material that I need to fix or like.	O
It's a bit of an issue is.	O
You can see here that this like stain continues on over here.	O
So the planks don't really feel.	O
Like different blanks, they feel like they're all connected.	O
It's an easy fix.	O
If you just I think it's like vertex normal you can grab the each.	O
Each plank and then just shifted so it's not a.	O
They don't line up both help break it up.	O
But that's something you want if you.	O
You had no planks like that.	O
But it's honestly.	O
It's not that noticeable.	O
I think they lined up all the way around.	O
I think it's a pretty good size there.	O
Very nice and this will be.	O

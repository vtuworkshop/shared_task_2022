I want to see what I used here.	O
Just.	O
Shut up iron.	CHITCHAT
Open.	O
What are you?	CHITCHAT
Oh, OK, you smart material here OK.	O
Perfect again.	CHITCHAT
I really liked how this how it turned out.	O
It's nice it's very nice OK.	CHITCHAT
Stop back over.	O
To do, don't need to save any changes here.	O
So I'm gonna look for hold and here we go.	O
Erica.	CHITCHAT
Now I can just add a mask, the tire.	O
Over the entire folder.	O
I don't do if everything below just perfect.	O
We could get rid of this one.	O
No, I think.	O
Yeah, let me.	CHITCHAT
See here.	CHITCHAT
I think it's with all these are.	O
Normally, I would have these stacked.	O
But I wanted to have you know?	O
Keeping them separated just let you be more unique with them.	O
So each one can look at the little differently aren't the highest resolution.	O
PDP.	O
Go in just messed with a different.	O
Factors here.	O
Those wheels could go away wheels.	O
Yeah, I don't have.	O
From LA to resolution work with her butt.	CHITCHAT
Should be good enough?	CHITCHAT
Do we have?	CHITCHAT
We have colored control, so here we go.	O
Situation.	O
Things out like some rest, it looks like.	O
Will it hard to see what I'm doing on these?	O
Aural intensity down a bit.	O
I'm smart material doesn't look like it.	O
Well, funky alright.	CHITCHAT
Did I do that?	CHITCHAT
Yes, I did OK.	CHITCHAT
Is quite small detail?	O
Having a little trouble with it, but Getting somewhere.	O
Really that yourself.	O
Let's get a quick render see where we're looking.	O
Just keeping an eye on that iron I think looks alright.	O
Could have done something more interesting with the geometry there but?	O
It is what it is this would is looking a little rich all things considered.	O
But 2 luxurious for you know.	O
Pretty aesthetic.	O
I'm going with with a Curt Sue that's easy fix will keep that edge off.	O
Now.	CHITCHAT
Give me a little sniffly today.	O
Is this color panel no all the other ones are the panel?	O
Oh naming is the hardest part.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
It's kind of dark in her name.	O
I think if it's the same color will just kinda plan into itself but.	O
Just a shade or 2 right?	O
That's enough to break it up, I think.	O
Can pretty so far looking good?	CHITCHAT

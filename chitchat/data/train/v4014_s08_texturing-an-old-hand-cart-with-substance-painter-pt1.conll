I can good let's.	CHITCHAT
To this on the back here.	O
Gonna be the right way.	O
No, that would've been too good with me if I had the right direction.	O
Well, actually.	O
To need to fix old school these site, I don't know panels.	O
Again, you know, many panels.	O
Just got duplicate these to clear that mask.	O
Pop it down here here they do Yanks.	O
Looks like I have some.	O
Texture stretching here must've been an oversight Leavis.	O
I don't think it's worth going back to fix to be honest.	O
You know what I know exactly where that happen.	O
No well.	CHITCHAT
We can make it work.	O
Topic this real quick.	O
See I don't see it when it was OK, I was there.	O
You know what it's not noticeable the sideways and soon sideways.	O
Supposed to vertical so I'm just going to going to keep it like that.	O
I'm contemplating having this.	O
Post rate here in the morning painting, having this, this corner post be like a different would again.	O
'Cause.	O
You know if I was like to imagine how this is made right.	O
This would be its own plank.	O
These ones would be their own.	O
Ultimately, we should probably also be there, only going sideways.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
But I can't be asked.	CHITCHAT
I don't think you would look that good to be honest.	O
Maybe if I heard in these edges, where they connect.	O
You had a little.	O
Breaking in that might be nice.	O
Let me try it with this blank real quick.	O
See how that looks.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
This time I'm going to use.	O
My face tubal here we go.	O
Jenna scared of all these faces.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's easier to do this in 2D.	O
Language forgot some metal over here.	O
OK.	O
Here's our spot.	O
Perfect.	CHITCHAT
Perfect perfect.	CHITCHAT
I think this would be a good spot to reduce reintroduce this darker wood.	O
So I'm gonna go ahead and.	O
Let's see grab one of these uses dark and.	O
Concert actually I'm just going to do this.	O
Minus will just have it in the rail section.	O

This is this there, we go.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
This is its own shell, Yep perfect.	O
Perfect was it.	CHITCHAT
Again.	O
So that's alright see now.	O
I wish this was just a little books to root it but.	O
We can probably work that end with a height map.	O
So let's try that out, 'cause I am what am I doing?	O
I like I think I like how this looks.	O
Yeah, OK, yeah, I do, I'm going to start with I'm going to use it down here.	O
On this, I don't know this extrusion here and that will just help frame it really nicely.	O
I want to do this.	O
It's going to be filled there.	O
'Cause everything is filler.	O
Be high.	O
I don't want to be like a?	O

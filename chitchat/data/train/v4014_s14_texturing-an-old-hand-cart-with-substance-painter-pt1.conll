As far as I'm curious is why the colors, so far off 'cause.	O
And I did Oh.	CHITCHAT
You know it, it was an accident, but I actually like.	O
The darker bed.	O
So yeah, it looks like when I was.	CHITCHAT
Barking the railside at bump the bed, which is Alright.	CHITCHAT
It's good or mask, yeah, sure did.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Actually, like decks and pops out from the.	O
The sites of it, so let's do the same here.	O
Just do the whole object.	O
No, we can't pull shell.	O
Yes.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Kind of why this lineup.	O
Find Canada now.	O
It would be the same.	O
Assuming I didn't ask.	O
That means the scale.	O
When I laid out my UV's is different.	O
Not a huge issue but.	O
So not.	CHITCHAT
Not not a problem you know.	CHITCHAT
Good.	O
No no no.	O
I don't think that noticeable.	O
We got a bit actually in what is good learning experience we got a hard line here.	O
Let me show you how to deal with seems.	O
It might this myth that may not work, so great 'cause we got these plank lines.	O
Hum.	CHITCHAT
We'll see.	CHITCHAT
See if I can remember how to do it paint layer.	O
I think you set it to pass through.	O
And then you use?	O
With this clone tool.	O
Satisfied and then blend away like that.	O
Ain't perfect, but it will help.	O
This holding vien clicking a set my source.	O
Still, going to have a hard line.	O
For some of the Maps, but like it was good for the color.	O
Being seen third line still line up and.	O
Not much I can do about that.	O
Just do our best to soften ease a little bit mostly where these.	O
Stains are.	O
It's clean him out a little.	O
Truce clean him out there, we go.	O
You did, Great I like bad.	O
Like that sums up a lot of my choices.	O
You know this was like a here proper.	O
Something that was it just some decoration.	O
I really go back fix it.	O
Maybe even incorporate.	O
Is right now this front piece?	O
Is a separate peace from the rest of the model?	O
I did that start I need to add extra divisions to the model or heavenly in guns.	O
But you know, we gotta say if this is a set piece.	O
I go back and fix.	O
It maybe make it part of the model.	O
But it's not so I won't and it's not so bad.	O
I don't expect the player or anyone to really get in there, you know, we're going to look at it from.	O
The distance of Farah now so far away.	CHITCHAT
Second guessing this would like I don't know if it stands out enough.	O
Patterns really easy to see them repeating down here, but I don't get cleaned up free dirty it up ironically.	O
I think it's good.	O
I had missed it before after gets you know before after not bad.	O
We spend a little more time do it better, but it's good enough just call it seem Blurt.	O
Very nice.	O

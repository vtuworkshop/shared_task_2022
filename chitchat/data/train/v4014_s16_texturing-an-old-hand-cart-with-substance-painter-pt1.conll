Kind of this material like tessellation in mind.	O
That's why these roots look so flat, but You know if you bring this into a game engine or something you can tessellate the Heightmap and.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
And push it up so it looks nice, then and this would be an OK.	O
Well, we, we met to speculate it's going to try.	O
We had a generator just dirt.	O
In fact, it seems too strong not inverted straight down.	O
I might not need to go back and fix it.	O
To kill the height in normals little little bit overwhelming.	O
Little yeah, see a little I mean extremely.	O
And see if out of all these parameters.	O
I bet that's not what I have right.	O
Of course not, Can edge witness though?	O
Nice.	O
I look at me, I have Oh.	CHITCHAT
I might not need to go back and fix this.	O
I can set the size here just down there like.	O
Show me the mascot quicker.	O
No mask.	O
There we go OK.	O
Early is a will there's a way.	O
Where we have 1/2 decent dirt?	O
Once again, too bumpy it's OK like on the.	O
Big flat area here, but Besides I mean?	O
Gives a nice caked mud affect I guess.	O
I just want to bring you down just ever so slightly.	O
I wish we just say you have no height controller.	O
It's on the right.	O
Yeah, I just finished some color.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Made perfect in Norman.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
I know we didn't need to do it multiplier, but honestly that.	O
It's nice to have this.	O
This later.	CHITCHAT
The desert for all of them I'm going to go into each layer individually.	O
Let's get something slightly bumpy.	O
Round thinking about it, you can have your height back, I don't think.	O
You really matters and it looks like it doesn't.	O
Beautiful and we're going to not generator a black mask.	O
And then we can throw it on a generator.	O
Dirt.	O
It's extreme.	O
Extreme dirt.	O
You don't look like you took my.	CHITCHAT
My suggestion there.	CHITCHAT
Perkins 'cause the generator.	O
I feel ya.	CHITCHAT
No biggie.	CHITCHAT
One issue.	O
Is the dirt is a very similar color to the wood so?	O
It's not really coming across.	O
Now I have.	O
2 dirt colors.	O
Turn off that generator you get a better look now just clear that mass.	O
We were all together, it's work on the dirt a little more.	O
This is what I thought was a good color.	O
Little late think I wanted on the darker side.	O
So we can just do that thing where we multiply.	O
I guess another layer.	O
To be do.	CHITCHAT
I think if I was to do that I would do like fill here.	O
Now 'cause it's mask.	O
DD.	O
It did did it be.	CHITCHAT

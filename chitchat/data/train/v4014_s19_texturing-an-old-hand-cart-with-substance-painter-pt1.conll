Curve in this right here.	O
Fairly recent comes up and.	O
Most the peak in the cart takes a look like that.	O
Or maybe that would clean away the dirt and we have little spots without it.	O
For Little hands girl you know.	O
Stuff like that.	O
Thank goodness for out of safe 'cause Man Oh man.	CHITCHAT
I'm always forgetting.	O
I am Really, like, how it's come together.	O
Knows it.	O
This is thing texturing is.	O
Early on it's like goof I don't know about this.	O
Once you add these fine details.	O
You know get some dirt that brings it to life mean nothing is clean, specially not old stuff.	O
So once you start, adding The Dirty late OK.	O
On a serious coming together right now, I'm just kind of shaking my hand.	O
This place with little bit of random.	O
I mean, it's good.	O
Got these settings here do that randomize the position the size and.	O
The rotation of the brush only doesn't look uniform, which is exactly what you want, but Really old shaky hand does the job, too or helps at least?	O
No maybe the dirt goes a little bit higher on this backside 'cause.	O
The cart would lift up right and so someone's caring it.	O
They lifted up all the dirt slides right back.	O
Maybe that's what we got going on.	O
It is really put you know, maybe some Hey, maybe that's like caring dirt around.	O
So how much do I put in here probably that.	O
Hey we can even throw some dirt on here.	O
Right right terribly vien.	O
Looking pretty good.	O
Set up a little.	O
You could look less like crime scene.	CHITCHAT
I wanna bring it up on the walls again.	O
Very nice now we can use this time to address like I don't know if you guys can see these patterns, but rate here repeats here repeats he repeats here can use this dirt just to break that up.	O
Had my repeating texture.	O
Looking good.	O

It's dirty this side up down.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Little bit shiny on the word I think not.	O
May be worth fixing maybe not I don't know.	O
Probably worth fixing.	O
You know, I think that's a good layer of dirt and let's just.	O
Get some quick before and after is just so you get the idea of like how important.	O
Messing up your stuff is like it just really.	O
I mean, it's night and day this looks good about giving wrong.	CHITCHAT
I like how this looks but.	CHITCHAT
Through that dirt on it looks real.	O
If I say so myself item me back to my own horn but.	O

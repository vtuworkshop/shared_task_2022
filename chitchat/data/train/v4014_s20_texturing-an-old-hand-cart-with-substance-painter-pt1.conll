Make a femur in that state would be good.	O
Don't wanna lose that sense, if.	O
Rihanna miss, though I don't want to let the uniform.	CHITCHAT
Prime makes a little more sense heaven concentrated the bottom.	O
If I was imagining it imagining it, it would be.	O
No maybe trainee covered in mud all the mud search dripping down Lansing these corners.	O
This thing grab those kind of things you're texturing.	O
Really helps just add another layer.	O
Respect side looks clean, Huh, it's no good.	O
Naked dirt.	O
Watch video.	O
So much truth.	O
Too much dirt.	O
Which is why we go back and take away?	O
Given we take here.	O
Even we take.	O
Still, not much.	O
Maybe this corner here is always sitting in the dirt right 'cause.	O
To 2 real card?	O
Well, actually I should sit forward so maybe not so much.	O
Maybe not so much.	O
But that just tells me that these parts right here, probably quite messy, maybe a little Polish from all the.	O
But grabbing with their hands.	O
I am happy with this.	O
Now we've been going for almost 2 hours here.	CHITCHAT
But it just flew by.	CHITCHAT
This is so.	CHITCHAT
So easy and relax now here we go time to cover up all those darn marks.	O
To stand out so much.	O
I was talking about earlier really just hide it all over the dirt.	CHITCHAT
Anything you don't like.	CHITCHAT
Dirt it away.	CHITCHAT
Not that dirt.	CHITCHAT
Dirt dirt dirt dirt.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Looking pretty good.	O
And be ready to call it.	O
Thinking of this Kurt needs anything else, I guess.	CHITCHAT
Maybe a touch up the old roughness while I'm thinking about it and we can just do this.	O
The same way we did the height and darken.	O
Turn to fill.	O
Only the roughness.	O
And How do I want to multiply?	O
Yeah, I'm not deploying.	O
You just No, not multiply overlay, Max Lane, dark and who knows.	O
Right.	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I was completely mad, we don't want to completely mad.	CHITCHAT
And we just want it affecting the wood so that's why I read it below.	O
We need that in dirt.	O
So let's save.	O
C6 Eve.	O
Call this roughness.	O
Adjust here we go.	O
Maybe to your uniform so maybe maybe a multiply is the way to go.	O
Maybe it's divide I don't know I'm not a math guy.	O
But still want variation, I don't want to be uniform roughness.	O
But I also just wanna bring.	O
I could go through bring all the levels down manually but I don't want to do it for each layer.	O

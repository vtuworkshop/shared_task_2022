So beautiful hi.	CHITCHAT
Tanner good morning.	CHITCHAT
Also, for me.	CHITCHAT
I think it's OK to maybe change some of the shapes a little bit.	O
It might be the case that this is like a famous area.	O
I don't know it's be honest, so maybe somebody would look at my painting and know that there's a rock in the wrong place, but to me.	CHITCHAT
It's not so important.	CHITCHAT
I think I'd rather pay attention to.	CHITCHAT
Making the Seen that look interesting so I'm going to be open to may be changing.	CHITCHAT
Some of the Rock Heights and things just.	CHITCHAT
So that it makes the composition better, so for example, over here.	CHITCHAT
This this one.	CHITCHAT
I think is nice and gives a little bit more balanced to the right side of the composition.	O
So I would like to exaggerate that more or at the very least, to make sure that I'm getting it.	O
At least as prominent as is in the reference and if anything.	O
I'd like to make it a little bit bigger just so we get the balance between this big one on the left.	O
And over, there.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Mill says the reference reminds me of the starting screen with the path in the foreground and mountains in the distance.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there's a little bit of that feeling I agree.	CHITCHAT
Read says what I think I love most of 'em desert scene is the fact that the shadows are really blue and purple so complimentary with the warm look.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I completely agree with you, yeah, yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's like this guy is very like especially on the sunny days.	CHITCHAT
There's like this blue purple vibrant Sky and you really see that in the shadows and you guys know I love to exaggerate the Blues and Purples in shadows when I paint so.	CHITCHAT
The starting soon screen Oh here faulty if you got here just a couple minutes earlier, you would have seen this so don't worry.	CHITCHAT
You didn't miss too much.	CHITCHAT
But this is just a painting that I did a while back now.	CHITCHAT
That was reminding Mills of the one we're about to do composition Wise.	CHITCHAT
So, like this over a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Hi Christina welcome.	CHITCHAT
So probably have to do a couple layers of.	O
Planning here like for example, want to have overlapping things, I find it easier to lower the Opacity then make a new layer and then for example, we can figure out this Ridge that comes down here and now it's easier for me to see the Ridge because everything else is a little bit later, so sometimes.	O
That's nice.	CHITCHAT
Did you get yourself something ability to see what you're doing?	CHITCHAT
And I really like the strong shapes of the shadows here.	O
That's another nice thing about these kind of scenes is like you can really emphasize the angles like I try to do that.	O
Even with other type of subject matter.	O
But I'm just not that strong with it.	CHITCHAT
Yet the whole stylization of shape language getting more interesting shapes angular shapes.	CHITCHAT
Maybe simplifying them a little bit, but in with the way that has some kind of.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Gesture an interest.	CHITCHAT
So that's what I'm going for.	CHITCHAT
Thanks.	CHITCHAT
Thank you at the Diggbar Ediola at but anyway, OK just trying to make sure.	CHITCHAT
Pronouncing your name OK, I'm sorry if I messed it up.	CHITCHAT
But welcome and thank you.	CHITCHAT
If anybody if you guys like the reference image and you are interested in also doing a sketch or painting of it, you're welcome to join me and like paint along while while I'm working and you know you're welcome to share what you do as well.	CHITCHAT
If you're interested in doing that no pressure.	CHITCHAT
But the reference images linked in the info section.	CHITCHAT
So it was generously shared by friend Andy so you can paint from it if you like to.	CHITCHAT
Alright so.	CHITCHAT
Think think that's good back here will have some more detail.	CHITCHAT
The only thing that I don't like about this just looking at my own.	O
Shapes the way this is being organized is I really want more variety in the size of the shapes and I feel like?	O
This is working OK, when I start, adding these in I end up with a situation where this shape the size of this shape the size of the shape or even these are all kind of balanced too much too much.	O

It makes it more interesting if we can have some variety there.	O
So I'm going to turn off this layer or maybe I can even just use a?	O
Select them, an change things this way, but maybe if we were to make these a little bit more flat and elongated just have some kind of different shapes going on.	O
Not all the same.	O
Being smells, he does, he does this is this is Andy Wo from in the discord and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I I saw his photos and I was like OK, you've done this before I think.	CHITCHAT
Alright so let's try again.	O
Pier.	CHITCHAT
So we don't need the red.	O
I'll try to paint along tries the keyword.	O
Jackson I was actually considering doing the line tool painting for this one.	CHITCHAT
I'm laughing at myself.	CHITCHAT
Now I I decided like we're going to do something a little simpler for that.	O
I really want to do a line to a painting, but I think this is not the reference to try it on.	O
When I say line toll painting if anybody doesn't know what I'm talking about just a type of.	O
Painting technique or workflow where you utilize the line tool instead of the paint brush to create your shapes in your image and it's a little bit well, I say a little bit.	O
For me, it was very tricky, I tried it recently is that when you pay using only the line tool.	O
Yes, I was thinking about trying it and then I quickly decided we're going to wait for us employer reference.	O
I need to have baby steps with I think.	CHITCHAT
Add Jackson meet you stole that idea.	CHITCHAT
Let's see how many sketch turns out, it's just.	CHITCHAT
It's just kind of the idea of it's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
You know it seems.	CHITCHAT
It seems fun and then you try it and you're like, Oh this is really hard.	CHITCHAT
But it just looks so cool when it's done well.	CHITCHAT
I can share with you guys, many of you probably already know this artist if you've.	CHITCHAT
I've talked about them before a few times, so but I can show you an artist who's really good with this type of thing that I'm talking about his name is Mike Hernandez and he did it recently did a workshop explaining the technique.	CHITCHAT
So I will post a link in the chat to one of his paintings that was done with the techniques so you can see.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
And you can check out the rest of his account too.	CHITCHAT
But all with the line tool is not incredible.	CHITCHAT
And I think it looks very cool.	CHITCHAT
Also, if you go if you scroll back through his paintings.	CHITCHAT
You know, there's others as well, and the interesting thing is, is kind of hard to tell at first.	CHITCHAT
You would never imagine, but it's kind of hard to tell at first, which ones are done with the line tool like when you're when you're scrolling through his account.	CHITCHAT
Everything looks very cohesive and then suddenly, you think yourself wait a second.	CHITCHAT
Business painted with the line tool?	CHITCHAT
How can you do that and how does it look like the other paintings here somehow look at this?	CHITCHAT
Line tool.	CHITCHAT
I don't know I love it.	CHITCHAT
I love it, but I don't think I don't think I'm ready for it on this one.	CHITCHAT
Read says my first 32 sheets block of paper is empty is it crazy.	CHITCHAT
I feel like an improvement.	CHITCHAT
I'm kind of proud of this, you should be proud of that.	CHITCHAT
That is, you know, I feel the same way anytime that I finished pack of paper or anything like that.	CHITCHAT
It's a big I think that's a big accomplishment being prolific with your art seeking Whippet doing a lot of work definitely definitely can be proud about that.	CHITCHAT
So I I think what I want to do is emphasize more.	O
The zigzag going down here and down and then down again.	O
So in my first sketch.	O
I hadn't really achieve that, so I think this is a little bit better going to bring back the opacity of both of these.	O
Layers.	O
Merge them together.	O
And then for example.	O
If I bring this down a little bit that zigzag is even more.	O
Prominent.	O
Are you allowed to use the lasso tool?	O

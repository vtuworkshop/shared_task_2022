Is well when you're doing the line tool thing?	O
Yes, you are I mean?	CHITCHAT
I'm not I I don't know if I know the details enough to say you're allowed to do this, or not to do this.	O
I think in the end.	O
You can decide what you want to do and how much you want to challenge yourself with being like strict with just using the line tool when I watched Mike's demo, he did also make selections.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
What tools you're using for painting right now?	CHITCHAT
I am using just the paintbrush it's on it's the everything is on one layer above the background.	O
I'm using a paintbrush and in order to make changes to my sketch.	O
I've been using the lasso tool right here and then making selections and then moving things around, so I just circle around what I want to move and then I press control T, which is a shortcut for transform and then I can like move around.	O
Things resize them stuff like that.	O
You can also when you have already made your selection.	O
You can just go to edit transform and you can select a whole bunch of different transform tools here, most often.	O
I just use the scale also use warp quite a bit.	O
I prefer using the warp.	O
Overlake liquefy if I have to make a little change like that.	O
Just select it and move it over.	O
OK, so I think the last thing is up here there's another.	O
Distant.	O
Large.	O
Rock what do you call it?	CHITCHAT
Boulder Canyon Plateau I don't know there's a big rock over here.	CHITCHAT
And I'm trying to figure out compositionally how it's best handled maybe I will just not include it.	O
That might actually be for the best do you see how up here in the reference there's like a closer rock and then one back here?	O
I think it is a cleaner nicer look if I don't include it.	O
The one right behind it.	O
It's kind of overlapping and a bit hard to take in what's going on.	O
I guess this line to insert brush tool, yeah, so for the line tool thing if you want to try it.	O
You can go to the shape tool.	O
Where it says like the rectangle ellipse.	O
All this stuff and then you just select a line and then you want to make sure that it's on pixels, not path or shape.	O
So then you're going to be making lines like this, you can pick whatever color you want and.	O
We move this over so I can access menu.	O
You can hover over the weight and drag this back and forth to change the size the pixel wait.	O
So if you want to make it larger there, you go.	O
And you can start blocking him like that.	O
It might be fun to try like beginning the paint, I might use the line tool, a little bit.	O
In this painting just for fun.	CHITCHAT
But I don't want to restrict myself from using other brushes.	O
I think I think that will use whatever brushes they feel inspired to use here.	O
The only thing that I don't like is with the line tool well.	O
One of the things I don't like is that I cannot use my shortcut keys with my left hand on the keyboard to change the size.	O
I like to use shortcut keys to change the brush size.	O
But in the case of wine to have to go up here and do it, which isn't end of the world because at least that's faster than.	CHITCHAT
Come you know, typing in a number you can at least drag the thing around but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's nice to nicer to change the size with a shortcut keys.	O
So I'm playing around with some cloud shapes here.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'm going to Stylize.	O
This a lot because I like the idea of the motion of the clouds and how they're kind of.	O
They look like they're going this way, and then curling up and.	O
Coming around this way they have a lot of movement.	O
It's kind of interesting so maybe we can emphasize that a bit and then there's one that's like a little bit different.	O
You guys are funny.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I turned the I flipped my canvas and I'm noticing how long key my sketch really is like it's at an angle, which isn't necessarily a huge problem because the landscape and it has a lot of angles to it.	O
But maybe it would be nicer to use skew or.	O
You know perspective and Trey Day.	O

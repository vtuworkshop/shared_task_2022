Get it to be a little bit more or just rotate it try to get that a little bit more of a flat horizon.	O
Did you do?	CHITCHAT
Mark May be back in time to be amazed at the end of stream.	CHITCHAT
Good luck everyone by half to Warren.	CHITCHAT
Good luck to you and I hope if you come back.	CHITCHAT
Later that you're going to see great painting, I will do my best.	CHITCHAT
Right so I flipped this is what we've got and.	O
Maybe I will.	O
Squish that in a little bit more.	O
I think that's OK.	O
Let's bring go to window knew guide layout 3 columns 3 rows and just have a look at our balance.	O
So it does seem interesting like we roughly have Sky on one third second, third bottom 3rd like it's working out pretty well.	O
I think maybe it would be nice to have.	O
This.	O
Come up a little bit more into that Top third.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
Playing with the composition a little bit.	O
All right.	O
I think I like it.	CHITCHAT
Hi Linnea welcome.	CHITCHAT
How are you thanks for coming over here?	CHITCHAT
It changed your name, yeah that's a difference over here, I'm glad you got it fixed.	CHITCHAT
Alright so right now, I'm getting rid of old layers.	O
I don't need and we have the background.	O
And we have.	O
Background layers just wait and we have the sketch.	O
One last thing I want to do is mess with the foreground.	O
I think I want to make the perspective a little bit more intense with the road coming towards us and then skew it over a little bit more towards the middle.	O
I think I kind of.	CHITCHAT
Toned that down from how it originally looks.	O
In my painting, but I like the movement.	O
So we want that left to right.	O
Feeling.	O
And there's going to be nice Bush here.	O
Had to 'cause I wanted to comment.	CHITCHAT
That maybe you could approach the line tool as a base color plan.	CHITCHAT
Then it wouldn't be the end goal but you might get more comfortable with it.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking about that.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a good idea.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a good idea that my only.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if the concern or something I was playing with my head is like do I want to use the line.	O
Tool also for the background.	O
The Sky 'cause?	O
I think this kind of Sky is so clean that maybe a grading.	O
It would be nice for it.	O
But I completely agree with what you're saying like so Lenny is suggesting to start off with the line tool just like block in everything.	O
Get my base colors and then if I want to.	O
I can keep going with like other brushes and textures and things and.	O
That might be a way to do it.	O
Your previous color blocking style was kind of like this already yeah, just using.	O
Airbrush or selections instead of the line tool, but you have the end result is going to be kind of similar.	O
I really like this rock on the left very cool how it's like breaking apart.	O
Great I think I'm almost done fiddling with the composition.	O
There's a lot going on here and so I do think the composition is important well it's always important right.	O
If you go the line tool.	O
We also use RGB sliders.	O
That's a good question.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, in the demo.	CHITCHAT
We watched the RGB sliders were used.	CHITCHAT
I think I think not.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I really like that technique for myself.	O
Like I I like.	CHITCHAT
I understand the idea of it, but I don't know if I enjoyed working with that.	O
Oh, OK.	O
Thank you Lenny, a good luck.	CHITCHAT

Good luck with everything.	CHITCHAT
You're working on.	CHITCHAT
Well, one thing is, you know, we always concede the sketch as it is, and try different things.	CHITCHAT
If it doesn't workout.	CHITCHAT
You know, we're doing digital here, so it's no problem we can change approaches.	CHITCHAT
If it doesn't go well.	CHITCHAT
Let's remind myself that sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Being scared try new things, it's literally.	CHITCHAT
With the worse it's going to happen.	CHITCHAT
Make a new layer.	CHITCHAT
Try something else.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I'm gonna save as is I will turn my layer onto multiply mode lower.	O
The Opacity so I can barely see it, but it's still there.	O
And then lock it so I don't accidentally paint on that layer and we can try.	O
Blocking things in with the line tool.	O
I'm not sure if I want to like infuse some kind of.	O
Gradient into the Sky that doesn't exist or in the reference or if I want to.	O
Just kind of go with.	O
A smooth Sky.	O
Wait, why is this?	CHITCHAT
Oh, and I also in a weird image mode.	O
No, I'm in RGB OK, OK, there, we go.	O
Anyway, sorry about that my question is, you know should I just go in with the line tool or should I just use a nice gradient background, then use the line tool for blocking and the other things.	CHITCHAT
You know, and how big can, we get this thing.	CHITCHAT
It seems silly to block in it's kind of like with your paintbrush.	O
I imagine you want to use like the largest brush for as long as you can.	O
So maybe I will choose like a tiny bit more of a bright.	O
Color for the As we get closer and closer to the.	O
Horizon line one thing that's really interesting is this with this method is the line tool is very opaque.	O
It's like there's no blending you have to really pick the right color because otherwise well.	O
You see what's going to happen, you see the edges.	O
As the colors.	O
All right next to each other.	O
I think on the left the blue is that a little bit brighter.	O
There is a little bit of a gradient in the Sky here.	O
They didn't notice at first.	CHITCHAT
Then it goes to a deeper blue.	O
Not so much purple so they had.	O
Something like this.	CHITCHAT
Who it's so tricky to get the right color?	O
Hello Ben, Alright well, I feel.	CHITCHAT
Unsure if that's a good look, but we're just going to carry on.	CHITCHAT
Let's continue so.	CHITCHAT
We're going to move down into a purple color for the distant.	O
Mountains distant Canyon area.	O
And we just have to start somewhere.	O
And then hopefully we can tweak towards a better color choice.	O
Need to lay down before you pass out into rest of stream Maddie.	CHITCHAT
Can I Tesla Happy Birthday?	CHITCHAT
Have a good rest.	CHITCHAT
I think that using this tool is going to have a lot of give me a lot of weird edges and stuff, it seems.	O
We will see how it goes.	CHITCHAT
Using it Rosie alot.	O
And.	O
So I talk about this sometimes when I'm doing.	O

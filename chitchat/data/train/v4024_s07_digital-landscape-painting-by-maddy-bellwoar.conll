You know my regular painting style where I will try to.	O
Choose the right color and sometimes make a bunch of mistakes first choosing colors that aren't the one I'm looking for and sometimes it can be a nice.	O
Yeah, I just I don't like the edges here.	O
Maybe I should make a selection and then use the line tool within that selection.	O
I would suggest you to use new layer for the background or for every major shape.	O
See guys no.	CHITCHAT
I don't like using layers.	O
But I think you're right.	CHITCHAT
Jackson that's what he did in the demo as well.	CHITCHAT
I think he used a lot of layers and I was thinking myself like.	CHITCHAT
That's a lot of layers.	CHITCHAT
You can fix the edges of smaller lines, OK, So what I'm going to do is make selection.	O
Oh also I just notice that I didn't bring the.	O
The Sky down low enough.	O
So that OK so let's try this again.	O
Background I'm just going to make a selection and we're going to paint with the line tool within that selection, so that I don't lose my mind, and that we can finish painting within 1 stream I hope.	O
Slow process OK, so now.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
That's not blind Hawk.	CHITCHAT
There we go so I think maybe it's easier for me to paint it all, as if it's in shadow first this very distant background area and then go within that shape and start adding.	O
Like highlights and stuff.	O
I think that's going to be easier.	CHITCHAT
So maybe something like this.	O
And then Now that's on its own layer.	O
So I can lock the transparency for that.	O
And do these kind of things.	O
Within their He.	O
Interesting OK, so let's just go on to the next.	O
Let's get rid of all the white and just get all the basic shapes and colors in first and then we will worry about it, it looks good.	O
So the next thing is, we're going to select like the next layer coming closer to us.	O
So, just getting the silhouette.	O
This one.	O
And we can turn that back on now and then this is going to cover it and so it's closer to us.	O
So we're going to get a little bit more of like the real color so it's going to be less atmospheric.	O
Glow.	O
So we're going to get a little bit warmer color.	O
Maybe a little bit more orange gold orange.	O
OK, so there's that is taking a lot of self control pink this away.	O
Let's go to the next one if you continue the line tool into details.	O
You can always go tiny in the edges.	O
But for this purpose.	O
The selections make more sense, yeah, I think so.	O
I think so.	CHITCHAT
That's one of those things where like we could be a stickler about it and you only line tool kind of thing, but I don't see the point.	O
This one is.	O
This is a little bit more efficient to do I think.	O
With the selections specially in like a certain amount of time to work.	O
But this is where I start getting into like what color is that so for example, there's green here but it's very it's not just green you're seeing through some in some places to the ground where it's like the warm color.	O
So I'm just going to stick to original plan, which is use the line tool to just block in the very, very basics and then use whatever brushes.	O
I want on Top of it.	O
I'm going to, I'm going to go along with that is always.	O
I don't know how to do that.	CHITCHAT

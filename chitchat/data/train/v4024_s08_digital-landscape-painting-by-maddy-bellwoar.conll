More yellow than you think it always is more yeah in this case.	O
We gotta go really, really warm kind of money with it.	CHITCHAT
I keep pressing my shortcut keys to try to change the line weight, but it doesn't.	O
Doesn't work?	O
It's definitely interesting I don't hate it.	CHITCHAT
Some things that I don't hate it but I don't really love it, either.	CHITCHAT
But it's fun to try so many things.	CHITCHAT
So for me, I guess this area here is kind of a problem right now because I want there to be.	O
Clean shapes of those shadows there, so to be separate thing to view.	O
The whiskey going.	CHITCHAT
I won't get into details yet next one what we can still work on this clear I think.	O
And want to bring in some of the warm.	O
Late on the pathway here it's going to get really bright.	O
It comes towards us, yeah, maybe I will just do this all.	O
Do it.	O
So for example.	O
Can make a selection over my sketch the road?	O
I see something related to this image on discord.	CHITCHAT
That's cool Mills, those are very cool.	CHITCHAT
Oh well, I don't know what I'm if I'm allowed to talk about it, he sent it to me privately but I think that's also.	CHITCHAT
So I selected an area and now we can just fill that in with the lighter color and even go a little bit lighter.	O
Leaving.	O
And at the centre or something like that there's some edges that have extra color.	O
I don't know.	CHITCHAT
Let's do the final.	O
Rock up here on the left.	O
Just going trace over my selection.	O
Trace over my sketch, I mean for the selection and then.	O
And here we go.	CHITCHAT
Then we can really assess like what to do after we have all the way covered.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
Intense.	O
So to me like the value structure is really, really missing here.	O
Hello master are welcome thank you.	CHITCHAT
Well, I don't have a headset right now is that what you mean.	CHITCHAT
But thank you welcome.	CHITCHAT
So right now, I'll show you what layers I have, I have this one by itself.	O
This one this one here here and the sketch on Top.	O
For my normal painting style, I don't really.	O
I don't really like to keep things on separate layers for so long.	O
But I think for this we kind of have to for a little bit longer.	O
I think I'm just going to sort of paint freely at this point, so I'm going to start using the airbrush an move away from line, too lonely.	O

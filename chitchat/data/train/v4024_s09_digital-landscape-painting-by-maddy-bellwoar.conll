Yeah, I just don't think the clouds will be nice to do with the line tool.	O
I don't know if I like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think I'm just going to like do my thing at this point and see how the line tool base.	O
Maybe maybe helped me make some stronger shapes.	O
I don't know to be honest.	CHITCHAT
It feels like.	CHITCHAT
It helps me make more chaotic and less deliberate shapes, which I don't know if I like considering how think this shapes were pretty good in my sketch and I feel like I wasn't able to accentuate them as much.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
I mean, I'm just being salty about it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm just going to paint now will see how it goes.	O
There was my little practice of line tool for the day.	CHITCHAT
What might be nice is to use this kind of brush use a flat brush like this.	O
That's kind of similar to the line tool.	O
Maybe that's a good way to integrate the two styles together and have it feel still like something cohesive.	O
So I'm going to make the.	O
Sketch a little bit more visible.	O
And then keep going.	O
Right so.	CHITCHAT
For the background.	O
We'll just go back and I will try to keep my painting sharper than usual, maybe.	O
Like the edges will I will try to keep the edges.	O
A little bit more clean.	O
I could also turn off transfer on this brush?	O
Which will make it even more similar to the line tool painting, but	O
It might be a little bit nicer because I can use my keyboard shortcuts to change the size of the brush and stuff, so be a little faster.	O
Working with this.	O
Painting on the wrong layer wow great start great start.	O
Alright let's make a selection of this and put it on the correct layer.	O
Right there, we go.	O
I'm going to lock the layer transparency an let's work on these shadows.	O
I want a nice purple purple blue in the shadows.	O
Something like this.	O
And we can go a little bit later in the middle.	O
I think there's.	CHITCHAT
Some more.	CHITCHAT
Bounce leighanne glow from the sun here.	O
But this whole area.	O
This pretty.	CHITCHAT
Purple and Glowy.	O
Do you do design product tech packs or just electric illustrations just illustrations?	CHITCHAT
I don't do like graphic design or stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
I don't have experience in in it, but	CHITCHAT
Just illustrations thanks for asking.	CHITCHAT
So I like this angle here.	O
Guys die back down along that zigzag so I want to get that in.	O
Oh, that's the wrong color.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Maybe a little bit more warm yet there we go.	O
I hope it is going well for you guys if anybody's painting along if you were.	CHITCHAT
Decided to give this one a try.	CHITCHAT
So even though my brush has a flat.	O

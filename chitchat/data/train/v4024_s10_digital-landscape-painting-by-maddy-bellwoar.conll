Edge I like to sometimes paint over Top an.	O
Get a sharp end.	O
To the brush stroke.	O
But then you have to take a couple steps to make that happen.	O
Over here, there's a bit more of a warm color.	O
On the rock.	O
And the little rocks and stones and dirt like tumbling down back here so I'm still using the flat brush at.	O
100% Opacity so still kinda tricky right now.	O
With choosing colors.	O
It's definitely.	CHITCHAT
Very intense practice for getting the right color.	CHITCHAT
What's funny is I when I do traditional painting?	CHITCHAT
I also paint pretty opaque, Lee and I don't.	CHITCHAT
Necessarily feel the Frustration.	CHITCHAT
That I do when I answer that digitally I don't know why I don't know why that is.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
But I haven't gotten.	CHITCHAT
Used to this kind of workflow yet.	CHITCHAT
Turn off the lock transparency, so I can add some extra layers up here.	O
I think overall this rock here needs a warmer color.	O
Something a little bit towards purple, but I don't want to change the value.	O
So starkly I don't want to make it.	O
Really really dark or anything.	O
But do you think that it's too bright right now?	O
And I guess it's OK, if our colors get a little bit more fantasy.	CHITCHAT
I know right now they are.	CHITCHAT
I hope that's OK.	CHITCHAT
Tiffany idea why color picking is harder and digital then when you're mixing colors in traditional.	CHITCHAT
I think there's a couple of a couple of theories on this, I think 1 is that.	CHITCHAT
You have certain number of pigments generally like you.	O
Well let's say you have a set with like 12 or 18 or maybe you just have the primary colors.	O
Or maybe you have like a warm and cool of each primary generally you have something that's like limiting the number of colors available, so there's some kind of like consistency or cohesiveness.	O
Do your colors that comes naturally from that.	O
So even if you don't, it's just like your painting will be more likely to have a color palette.	O
That seems to work together because of that.	O
That's been my experience like in digital you have every possible color at your disposal in a quick moment.	O
So you can easily choose colors that don't look good together.	O
Whereas in In traditional I often will paint on a dirty palette so the colours are already there from let's say I mix 1 color that I need and then I want another color.	O
Let's say the first color was Brown and then I want another color after that.	O
That's green.	O
I can mix into that.	O
Brown, an kind of turn it more towards a green color and it's going to have a code more cohesive feeling because it's going to include some of that original color in the new color mix so.	O
When I'm picking colors in digital it's like also just the opacity of digital in general.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Your portfolio So what do you do mainly master or let's see?	CHITCHAT
Some 3D modeling.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that makes sense Mills like Oh Gosh.	CHITCHAT
I'm so displeased with this painting right now.	O
I am almost considering like starting over instead of trying to work.	O
From here because it's so bad in my opinion like and it's not like it's not just like Oh.	CHITCHAT
This is horrible work.	CHITCHAT

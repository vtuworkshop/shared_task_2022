Keep going.	O
And I'm going to add some highlights here.	O
Nice Jackson enjoy and thanks again for sharing your work in progress and painting with me.	CHITCHAT
Hi Michael Yeah, Yeah, it's it's I've been enjoying streaming on Behance also and the still streaming on Twitch, too.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's very nice.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of things that I'm enjoying I like that, you know, I often share reference images.	CHITCHAT
With everyone while I'm painting and I think it's really nice that there's actually a place for that specifically here is really cool.	CHITCHAT
So you guys can grab my reference image if you want under the info tab.	CHITCHAT
Want to join in.	CHITCHAT
I have to remember to paint on the right layer right now, it's very tricky.	O
Not used to having separate layers so many separate layers.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's make another one why not?	O
There's a Shadow that comes across here.	O
Having trouble getting stream to work an app to figure it out later.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I'm sorry about that.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I hope you're able to get it work.	CHITCHAT
Lee getting hopefully you're able to get it work work later.	CHITCHAT
There's something nice about watching the the past videos here.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
If you watch the video later here, you will be able to see the tools that I'm using.	CHITCHAT
As I'm using them because there's a.	CHITCHAT
Plug in for that that I have going right now, so it's kind of cool thing.	CHITCHAT
Lower the opacity of that.	O
Erase out little bit Oh, you know what I just realized something would have been cooled.	O
I didn't even think about is using?	CHITCHAT
See color dynamics on the brush that would be kind of fun.	O
I'm going to use color dynamics.	O
See how it looks.	O
I think it fits this kind of Aesthetic.	O
Maybe I'll switch to my triangle brush a little bit.	O
Well, I think I'm getting to the point where I want to merge stuff.	O
It just annoys me, too much to keep it separate so I will keep the Sky Separate.	O
I'm gonna read everything else.	O
And just keep going.	CHITCHAT
I can't work like this.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to go over some areas that I already painted and give a little bit more.	O
Like texture and interest with the colour dynamics brush.	O
And can add some.	O
Blue and a little bit different colours up into the.	O
Mountains.	O
This brush is kind of interesting it almost makes it look like there's a filter or something on here.	O

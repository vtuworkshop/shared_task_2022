So I wonder I do want at the end.	O
I do want there to be good.	O
Strong shapes in this so I'm hoping that I can choose where I'm going to put those.	O
Shapes and emphasize them.	O
So I feel like we're going to need to put a few brushstrokes that really stand out in here.	O
Make a selection of this rocky area and.	O
There's some nice bounce late coming back onto it.	O
You see like cracks in between.	O
The rocks.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
Let's flip let's put the campus for a little bit.	O
So I can see what I'm doing.	O
Ideas.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, and I think it's a cool effect that that as the is curving over.	O
You get the warm bounce light facing down and the blue.	O
Purple reflect light facing up it's the same.	O
Thing.	O
How can you tell difference between bounce light in the color of the rocks?	CHITCHAT
I don't I don't know.	CHITCHAT
The bounce late is you don't really necessarily tell the difference.	O
You just tell that over here.	O
The Rock looks like this color over here.	O
The Rock looks like that color.	O
There's bounce light affecting the rocks everywhere.	O
So there's almost no situation in this scene that I can tell where you would say like this is what the rock actually looks like maybe right here.	O
Maybe maybe right here, you know is like an area, whereas this is like blue and this is the.	O
But it's kind of just.	CHITCHAT
Looking at paying attention to the Plains, so paying attention to where the rock is facing down or facing up and noticing the light and how it's affecting it.	O
But it can be confusing.	O
I find that natural types of bounce light like stuff that's going on here is a little bit more easy for me to understand 'cause I'm starting to see patterns in it.	O
After doing a lot of landscape painting, but what I found find really confusing is when I've tried to do.	CHITCHAT
Like a fantasy type scene where you have, like really intense, light on something like let's say there's someone with some kind of superpower and there's like a blue glowing effect.	CHITCHAT
It's really strong and then maybe they have like?	CHITCHAT
Purple skin or something you know like those kind of stories are like how.	CHITCHAT
What is that going to look like an you know you just have to kind of?	CHITCHAT
Play with it and you know, there's color theory to it, but the point is when you get into like fantasy scenarios where it's not things that you see all the time and you can kind of rely on well, I painted.	CHITCHAT
This kind of setting before an you know did it and then you know, these kind of scenarios get really confusing for me.	CHITCHAT
It's it's hard.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to predict what the color.	CHITCHAT
The color of something is going to look like when there's so many different factors.	CHITCHAT
So reference is great, but when you are trying to make it up.	CHITCHAT
If you're trying to make like a fantasy scene and you have to think about this dragon going to look like with this kind of lighting on it's like.	CHITCHAT
Very very tricky in his school ISM course.	CHITCHAT
Nathan Fox talks about it a bit.	CHITCHAT
There's there's a section on that and it is helpful, but I think it's also something that just takes an immense amount of practice an like trial and error and just kind of getting a feel for things so I don't think that there's like 1 tutorial.	CHITCHAT
That's going to make it all makes sense when it comes to that.	CHITCHAT
I think there's a lot of trial and error.	CHITCHAT
I like these different colors of greens well Bush is.	O

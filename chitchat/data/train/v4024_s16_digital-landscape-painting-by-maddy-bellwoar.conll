Some of them are more blue green some are more.	O
Brownish warm green.	O
But I want to start getting some of those in roughly around different areas, the painting.	O
So that we get some kind of.	O
Feeling of foliage and life here.	O
Maybe I can kind of sketch in.	O
Some little areas that are.	O
We see through to the.	O
Ground the rock to the.	O
3rd whatever it wanted you wanna call it this nice color warm color.	O
That would be nice.	O
It's just I feel like it's getting muddy like I don't want that so maybe I should turn off color dynamics for this detail.	O
Maybe we need to, like just really be confident with the colour choice here.	O
Can even turn off transfer?	CHITCHAT
Alright so this is just.	O
A layer.	O
To prepare for pudding some I want to put some plants and stuff on Top, but I want the green do stand out more against a different color.	O
Environment so I want the warm colored dirt to be showing through and then on Top of an with some tough sofa green.	O
I think maybe that's a little bit better.	CHITCHAT
Alright so.	O
There's a very blueish.	O
Green going on desaturated blue green going on here actually almost these Gray.	O
Yeah, look at that that's amazing, so the whole relative color.	O
Look at that look at how that looks green.	O
It looks green to me anyway.	O
But it's actually completely desaturated so I can go through red even and go.	O
Really really low saturation and it still looks cool grey.	O
Hi Roni, welcome thanks for coming we're painting a?	CHITCHAT
Landscape in I think this is in Utah, but I'm not 100% sure this is a Photo by Andy in the discord who let me use it for study it's beautiful.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, you guys can download the photo if you want an paint with me or just hang out mean joy right faulty.	CHITCHAT
It's so crazy, so I'm looking for a green.	O
A desaturated like blue green and I think honestly using like 100%.	O
Gray is probably a good choice for that, even though it feels crazy.	O
And I will also use color dynamics just for a little.	O
Will extra something?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to pop in some little Tufts of.	O
Plants and things growing.	O
I'm just using a triangle shaped brush this whole time.	O
Maybe eventually I will decide to use a brush with some kind of texture that might be fun.	O
I like to use voyage brushes, sometimes for brushes that have a lot of texture to indicate foliage.	O
But at this point.	O
I think the most important things for me is to get the colors right and the values in the scene.	O
So I can get all of that and I still have time I will focus more on textures.	O

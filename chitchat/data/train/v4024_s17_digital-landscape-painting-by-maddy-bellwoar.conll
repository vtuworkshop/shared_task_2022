Not before.	O
It is right, yeah, so.	CHITCHAT
Colors are.	CHITCHAT
Colors are weird higher, with a relative.	O
Relative nature.	O
You think you have one color you put an X to another color it looks totally different.	O
I do think this.	O
Is kinda cool this angle of?	O
The dirt and Rocks and sediment like have tumbling down.	O
These mountains.	O
At the bottom.	O
And I initially wasn't going to make that a lot.	O
The large part of the scene.	O
But now I'm kind of going back on that and then, adding it in.	O
Let's get some of these ridges on the Top.	O
So left any warm colors are going to be facing to the left.	O
That's where the light is coming from where the sun is our light source and.	O
We can just keep adding little highlights on the left side.	O
Wherever the rock is sticking out, far enough to catch the light.	O
And that way we can add some more interesting shapes right now, it's just a big block back there, and we don't have to make it super detailed.	O
Specially 'cause, it's in the distance, but just a little bit more.	O
Let's flip canvas and put my painting.	O
Put my reference.	O
Also added some more shadows.	O
I think that helps.	O
And over here, too, there's Ridge that comes around.	O
And we have to do the same thing with the light come back in with the opposite.	O
Clear highlight the tops.	O
Hi Paul, Good morning.	CHITCHAT
How are you?	CHITCHAT
We're painting a Canyon seen today and I started this off with a crazy workflow using just the line tool.	CHITCHAT
I tried to make it work, but I was in struggle city and I decided to abandoned at some point and just.	CHITCHAT
Paint on Top.	CHITCHAT
It was interesting to try.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I'll try it again sometime.	CHITCHAT
With a simpler reference.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if anybody is watching and you'd like to try my brushes.	O
You can download those if you don't already have them.	O

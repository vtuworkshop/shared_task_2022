I think maybe this little triangle of late is distracting.	CHITCHAT
I don't know trying to decide if I want that to be there.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I need to go the opposite way, and really exaggerated more.	O
I just don't want to lose the zigzag.	O
In the composition.	O
Yeah, maybe that's better change it up.	O
Yeah, I'm going to be streaming one.	CHITCHAT
One day week on be hands.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Wednesdays.	CHITCHAT
Starting a regular schedule, it's going to be.	CHITCHAT
Wednesdays at 12:30 my time, which is the usual time that I start stream.	CHITCHAT
And I'm also still streaming on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
Bacon family here on Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
And we're going to do a little bit more detailed painting like bigger time.	CHITCHAT
Do a little longer.	CHITCHAT
Stream well, not longer stream, but a longer.	CHITCHAT
Time on one painting.	CHITCHAT
And I'm trying to explain my process and everything.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit of trial and error on this one was because I was trying something new, so if you guys have any questions, you can always ask me.	CHITCHAT
I've been good crazy crazy stuff like so much is happening.	CHITCHAT
But I'm I'm good, I went on a trip last weekend from Friday to Monday and I was in Florence with cow says Wolf and his mom and we had a really good time.	CHITCHAT
Like I've always wanted to go there is my first time there, so it was a huge thing an?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's been really busy like.	CHITCHAT
But good good good, I feel very inspired.	CHITCHAT
Wanted to get some feedback as well, an experiment piece, yeah of course, let's see.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is cool.	CHITCHAT
I like the art nouveau kind of vibe.	CHITCHAT
This is phase is work.	CHITCHAT
Really nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think.	CHITCHAT
Gas first feedback if you want to critique or anything.	CHITCHAT
It's such a different style than what I do so it's kind of hard.	CHITCHAT
I think it looks really nice think the detailing with the designs around the outside I mean, it really looks.	CHITCHAT
It looks very classic art new both to me, Love Art Nouveau wanted to try it out?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I mean, I think for.	CHITCHAT
I think for this character, the colors that you chose makes sense.	CHITCHAT
My only suggestion would be if you wanted to in the future.	CHITCHAT
You could try to like pick a like complementary contrast in color for the sum of the design so the character like pop out more, but at the same time.	CHITCHAT
Is make sense to use the green?	CHITCHAT
This is something to think about?	CHITCHAT
I think it's a I think it's a successful experiment busy I hope you had fun with it.	CHITCHAT
I'm noticing some tangents, forming here, so I think I'm going to make this rock a little bit bigger.	O
So it kind of overlaps earlier, yeah that simplifies it a little bit that's better.	O
We can get her zigzag back.	O
This also.	O
Points towards there.	O
Ah.	CHITCHAT
I'm noticing something in the composition that I kind of missed.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
Going to merge this and just duplicate everything.	O
So this rock here, Brock is huge.	O
Huge structure huge Mountain Canyon I'm not sure what to call this plateau.	CHITCHAT
When did you flip last?	CHITCHAT
Oh, I bet flipping a fair amount.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm not sure exactly how long ago, the last one was but.	CHITCHAT
I think I think I found an issue.	O
This.	O
Rock has a kind of fades down into the.	O

Into that.	O
Zig zag and kinda helps with it.	O
I mean, you could consider this is also a tangent but I don't know I think it works.	O
That's something in the composition that I changed you did after I asked.	CHITCHAT
OK, sorry about that, yeah, I have been flipping a bit, but I somehow didn't see this.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to make some adjustments.	O
Without redoing everything will see how that works.	O
Let's see if easy says here are some examples.	CHITCHAT
What do you think I could learn from those?	CHITCHAT
These are so pretty.	CHITCHAT
Ah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think.	CHITCHAT
I think they do have a little bit more of like.	CHITCHAT
There are a little bit less monochrome.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
I think you're I think you're on the right track.	CHITCHAT
Maybe can open years up again.	CHITCHAT
Take a look.	CHITCHAT
I think also these have the head of the character like really smack dab in the center of the circle.	CHITCHAT
And I think that helps I think.	CHITCHAT
I think maybe yours is like sharing attention with this swirl a little bit and her head completely blocked.	CHITCHAT
It then maybe that would be a little easier to read but I think you've done very well with that kind of style.	CHITCHAT
Sorry for the hold up here as I.	CHITCHAT
Revamp my whole composition.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it happens.	CHITCHAT
Here's my paint along yes.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
Who super cool?	CHITCHAT
This feels like.	CHITCHAT
Plea this feels like like really warm.	CHITCHAT
It's crazy because you're using so much blue and cool colors here, but this feels like a hot day like this sunlight feels intense.	CHITCHAT
That's really cool.	CHITCHAT
It feels very, very bright and very hot out in this painting, it's interesting you're able to capture that.	CHITCHAT
Hey Andy Welcome I'm painting your photo.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much for letting me use it.	CHITCHAT
It's amazing, I started out.	O
With a different workflow than usual attempting this line tool.	O
Challenge thing and it was kind of rough, I didn't really enjoy it so.	O
I I switched after that back to my normal painting.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Now I'm Going back over things, yeah, I'm just taking it from here, so the line tool did provide a good starting point.	O
But then I moved on to.	O
My normal painting.	O
Routine.	O
Pretty cool photo, yeah, it is feels like a photo from the 80s.	CHITCHAT
That's funny.	CHITCHAT
Such a nice simple palette to basically 3 colors, plus white.	CHITCHAT
Really?	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
3 colors, plus weight I was thinking about that, after the James Gurney video that I shared earlier today.	CHITCHAT
After watching that this morning.	CHITCHAT
I was actually thinking about how he described his color palette and it seemed extremely limited, but his painting doesn't at all look like he's using a limited palette.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty wild how that works I'd like to learn more about that 'cause I tend to like to have.	CHITCHAT

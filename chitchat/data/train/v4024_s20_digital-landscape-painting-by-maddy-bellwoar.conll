Whatever colors I want even if I don't use all of them.	CHITCHAT
I always start a painting with like a whole bunch of tubes of paint.	CHITCHAT
I my first paint.	CHITCHAT
Selection that I had was the Holbein 18 colors set and so.	CHITCHAT
Then I after that, I decided to just get the complementary and not the complementary sorry the primary colors and sort of mix my own from there.	CHITCHAT
But I still use a lot of other tube sometimes.	CHITCHAT
If I get stuck on something or it's just faster and.	CHITCHAT
I have a hard time deciding how to limit myself in that way.	CHITCHAT
Adding a little bit more purple here.	O
Merge that down so I can compare from a little bit go to now.	O
I'm not sure if it's better or not, but.	CHITCHAT
Where we're going we're continuing on?	O
Here.	O
Try to paint the school last night, but I don't know what I'm doing.	CHITCHAT
Mill says it was a good start.	CHITCHAT
did I did you post it and I missed it, but either way.	CHITCHAT
I'm proud of you, you know it's?	CHITCHAT
When you're starting something it's always going to be.	CHITCHAT
It's going to be tough, at first, and it's going to feel awkward.	CHITCHAT
I mean, even as someone for me?	CHITCHAT
Who did art my whole life.	CHITCHAT
When I first started doing digital just like having a new medium was tough and I felt awkward with it and you know it was.	CHITCHAT
Took awhile to get comfortable with that so.	CHITCHAT
You're doing you doing good.	CHITCHAT
Just starting and just kind of getting through those.	CHITCHAT
Those early ones.	CHITCHAT
Let's see to do today's inktober I don't know if I like it or not OK.	CHITCHAT
Let me see red.	CHITCHAT
I like it, I like this alot, the Cherry Blossoms.	CHITCHAT
I think it's really pretty I like how like These kind of fade away you can see that maybe these are other cherry blossom branches in the background.	CHITCHAT
And then the one that's more.	CHITCHAT
Prominence is done with actual fine liner so you can see it clearly is very relaxing and pretty to look at.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I really like it, I wonder what you are.	CHITCHAT
Not liking.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it's great.	CHITCHAT
Ah, yeah, read it looks really nice.	CHITCHAT
It's definitely reading well.	CHITCHAT
Definitely.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I think I want to start with some details on here, so for example, the cracks in the rock.	O
Especially this close.	O
This rock that's close to us on the right.	O
I'm going to do this on another layer in case I don't like it but.	O
It's important for us to have these.	O
Sharp and intense shadows, I think.	O
I mean, if you look at the reference they definitely exist there.	O
Maybe I can first sketch them in.	O
But it's like the way that the rock is just kind of breaking up.	O
OK, so I sketched in some now let's go and add a deeper.	O

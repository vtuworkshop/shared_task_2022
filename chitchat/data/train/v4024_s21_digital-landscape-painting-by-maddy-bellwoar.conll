So I'm just using the racer 2.	O
Erase out anytime by go over the.	O
The rock shape into the other one 'cause I want them to have clean and.	O
I want them to be clean and very different from each other like I want to be easy to see that the the individual shapes.	O
It was probably 10 to 11:00 AM to the contrast is pretty high odd that's cool.	CHITCHAT
That's cool to hear by the way it worked was this exactly or maybe.	CHITCHAT
Not exactly but is this in Utah or something it.	CHITCHAT
Looks like pictures.	CHITCHAT
I've seen from Utah, but I've never been there, so I'm not exactly sure.	CHITCHAT
But it's a really, really pretty.	CHITCHAT
I love the colors.	CHITCHAT
And the shapes and the leading lines.	CHITCHAT

You're doing at Canyon Painting.	CHITCHAT

So there's a little something that we lose with this.	O
And when we Add all these shadows so I'm going Theresa, a little bit.	O
Try to keep it pretty minimal like just in the cracks.	O
Happy to meet you all well.	CHITCHAT

Something like that.	CHITCHAT
Or normal.	O
Boo.	CHITCHAT
OK busy enjoy the Luke thanks for being here.	CHITCHAT
This might technically not be within Canyonlands, the road depends.	CHITCHAT
In too deep into a Canyon and then follows the Colorado River at some point you leave the park at Camera if it's past that or not OK, OK well.	CHITCHAT
I was even just trying to make sure trying to figure out what state was in so it's OK.	CHITCHAT
If you don't know exactly exactly specifically but thanks for the info.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to merge this down.	O
Straight be brave.	CHITCHAT
And I might soon be getting through a part where I want to use a different brush.	O

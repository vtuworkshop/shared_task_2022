I've been using 1 brush for really long time now.	O
An I do like the cohesiveness that gives the painting.	O
But I'm going to be having a little.	O
Bush on the left hand side.	O
And there's also going to be.	O
Some random little foliage and Tufts and things so I think it might be nice to use a brush with some different texture.	O
Just trying to decide when it's time to bring that in.	CHITCHAT
Or if I can maybe get away with just using this brush there's some other techniques.	O
We can use one just painting it, but for speed, it might be nice to maybe use the lasso tool.	O
Make a selection of an area and then we can just paint within that kind of scribble in a texture or something that's kind of cool thing to do.	O
So let's try it.	O
I'm going to make a new layer and for example, over here, there's these little Tufts of grass is so I'm just going to select.	O
Roughly the shape of what I wanted them to be.	O
And then pick a color and then we can do something like this.	O
Where we like scribble in?	O
Like that.	O
And it makes a cute little grassy shape.	O
We can lock the layer.	O
And then pick another color if we want to give a little bit of a gold gradient to it and we can.	O
Like draw inside of that shape or.	O
Choose like an airbrush.	O
And do something like that.	O
That's kind of fun.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think I will add a couple like that.	O
And, of course, it's a little awkward with them just coming out of the ground with nothing around them.	O
But I think if we add a few it'll be nice.	O
Let me just keep an eye on what time it is?	CHITCHAT
Alright we're doing pretty good.	CHITCHAT
We have time to add fun details and things.	CHITCHAT
I think I have about.	CHITCHAT
Another hour to an hour and a half to work on this.	CHITCHAT
So I think everything is really.	CHITCHAT
Kind of in place at this point, and we just need to make it look nice.	CHITCHAT
So I think I think we should be able to do that.	CHITCHAT
Are using Adobe photo shop software?	CHITCHAT
Yes, I am?	CHITCHAT
I'm using Adobe photo shop CC 2019?	O
I have the photography subscription so.	O
I have that includes photo shop and Lightroom.	O
Yes, I'm using photo shop right now for painting.	O
Just going to put one of these on it, a little bit an angle.	O
And that's that for those 2.	O
Let's keep going a new one now we can do the same thing with like me zoom in on the reference.	O
There's some other areas like that over here.	O
I think Oh that's just shadow.	O
I thought there was like a purple plant growing.	O
We can select areas.	O
I'm kind of just paint within them.	O
Which is a cool way to make some textures without?	O
Using a texture brush.	O
Your sound is quite low.	CHITCHAT
I haven't heard anyone else mentioned that.	CHITCHAT
Did you turn it up as high as possible on your end guys?	CHITCHAT
Let me know if anyone else?	CHITCHAT
Is having trouble but it's already at the maximum in my streaming software so I'm not sure I can change it.	CHITCHAT
I have 34 layers, Please send help Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Jackson how I can't do it.	CHITCHAT
I can't do it with some kids.	CHITCHAT
I give you a lot of credit for sticking sticking with this one and doing.	CHITCHAT
Trying that crazy line tool stuff, although I really did like the barn painting that you posted.	CHITCHAT
Hollys, like merge them.	CHITCHAT
OK thanks Mills.	CHITCHAT

I think I got up to 22 on my art.	CHITCHAT
Nouveau piece, yeah, I can understand that.	CHITCHAT
That seems like the kind of style that you would want things to be very clean.	O
You have to keep things separate bit.	O
So the shadow that's crossing the.	O
The pathway here.	O
Is meeting up on the other side?	O
With the foliage here, so I should probably put those in shadow also.	O
The layers are pretty necessary in that case like with different circles, yeah exactly.	O
Can imagine?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I find that depending on the art style.	CHITCHAT
It makes a lot of sense to have different layers.	O
If you want to keep things very clean and.	O
If you have a lot of line work and if you do a shading that's like kind of cell shading and that kind of thing it makes sense to keep a lot of separate layers.	O
We know it drives me crazy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this one area is getting very busy right now, I'm not sure if I like.	O
Where that's going?	O
But I'm just going to merge.	O
Will keep going with his pain on Top of it layers?	O
Are too confusing for me to keep track always being on the wrong layer.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that happened to me today.	CHITCHAT
Like you think at some point that's going to stop happening to you, but it never does like it's always it's always a possibility.	CHITCHAT
There's always the potential to being on the wrong layer.	CHITCHAT
So one day you will paint some rocks on the side of the road here there's little.	O
Little rocks and little stones and things.	O
So I'm wondering if I can kind of scribble them and not if that'll work for example.	O
There's one here that's like pretty big enough to.	O
Bother establishing sheep.	O
But there's also a lot of little ones where you just see like a highlight.	O
And maybe some where you see the shadow.	O
So we can just kind of hint that these little.	O
Details.	O
Skipped all the little rocks, yeah, I don't blame you.	O
I'm not sure if I should too.	CHITCHAT
It seems.	CHITCHAT
It seems like a bit of a distracting detail to consider adding but the road does get really close to us so I guess the point where I'm like well.	O
What do I do down there is it?	CHITCHAT
Is it OK to leave it smooth?	O
I think it's just a choice that.	O
Yeah, I can go one way or the other.	O
Looks like an illustration thank you.	CHITCHAT
We're getting there.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to work in a little bit of this area next to the side of the road because then I'm hoping I can add some lighter, Tufts of green that will come in front and.	O
Have a little bit of A.	O
Will stand out more?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think that makes it look a little bit rocky.	O

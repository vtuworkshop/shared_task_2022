I bought a rake brush makes painting grass employment easier ooh that's a good suggestion.	O
You know, I have a couple of Rick brushes and I always forget about them.	O
I rarely ever use them.	O
There, in my brush set.	O
I have a tendency to do that, like forget about brushes and then like rediscovered them and use them for like.	O
A week and then go through the next brush Oh this one is also cool.	O
And forget about it.	CHITCHAT
The brush I'm using right now used to be my Top favorite brush.	O
I haven't used in a while and now here we are.	O
You too, it's a fun, though.	CHITCHAT
It is.	CHITCHAT
So I think I want to mess with selective color a little bit.	O
I'm going to make actually L duplicate this layer in case I don't like what I do.	O
But I'm going to go to image it just selective color.	O
I know I could also use an adjustment layer, but This is how we're going to do it.	O
And I can hear shift and mess with the different different colors in the image so if we want more red.	O
We can do that.	CHITCHAT
and I actually think more red is a very good option.	O
I think it looks as an ice pop to it can exaggerate the mood a little bit so if we lower the cyan.	O
I don't know if I like more magenta that makes it locally in the day.	O
So we'll go we won't do that.	O
But the yellow is good, too.	O
And then we can make the reads like warmer lighter or darker.	O
I think that's good so we can kind of check the difference.	O
And it didn't do too much.	O
It did saturated more and make it tiny bit more warm.	O
So let's go to selective color again and mess with the yellows.	O
So we can decide do we want them to be more green.	O
I think we do.	CHITCHAT
We can also make them more.	O
Warm so this will get rid of some of the greens that I chose that were very little to green and not.	O
Warm enough that kinda helps with that.	O
And we'll see you know if we like.	CHITCHAT
What we're doing here but it's fun to mess with so next let's do magentas?	O
So I think it's nice to make the Magento's a little bit more.	O
Blue maybe so there's more of a contrast between the warming cools.	O
A little bit later value.	O
Did I cancel that?	CHITCHAT
Selective color.	O
Magentas Here we go.	O
OK.	CHITCHAT
I kinda like it.	CHITCHAT
It can be fun to just go through these and see how.	CHITCHAT
See how the different options look, you can really change the whole move your your painting.	O
In this stage, which is kind of a little worrying sometimes but.	CHITCHAT
We can be overwhelming to have all those the power to change all those things.	CHITCHAT
So that purple got really bright, but I kinda like it.	O
I want to experiment with it a little bit and also let's mess with this guy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, well will saturate this guy a little bit more.	O
When I started this, I was using the line tool so now.	O
Maybe we can.	O
Just go back and smooth out the Sky a little bit will add some.	O
Clouds.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Can also Take a look at the levels.	O
The adjustment layers.	O
Change the The contrast a little bit.	O
Well thanks Mills.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you think so.	CHITCHAT
Really be hands has an iPad app, but you can't watch streams on it is that true.	CHITCHAT

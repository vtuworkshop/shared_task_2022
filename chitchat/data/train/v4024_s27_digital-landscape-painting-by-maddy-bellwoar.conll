The Gray blue like we can choose a lighter blue also.	O
Let's turn into black and white.	O
Well, I hope you guys are doing well if you're painting along or working on any of your own stuff.	CHITCHAT
I hope it's going well.	CHITCHAT
I definitely had a little bit of a rollercoaster with liking and disliking this painting as we went through, but I think overall I I like it now.	CHITCHAT
Let's try color dynamics on our brush in the Sky.	O
Kinda forgot that I've been using that I think I might want to just merge the clouds now.	O
I will duplicate the Sky layer just in case but I'm going to merge that down because it's nice to be able to color pic from the.	O
Background and just bring it back into the clouds shape.	O
Of course, you can use the eraser for that.	O
But I like the freedom of just being able to color pic with the?	O
Alt.	O
Bring up the shortcut color Picker and just keep painting it's super fast.	O
And maybe it's nice if this guy has some different inconsistencies with it, whereas right now, it's just the Airbrush.	O
Color dynamics on the cloud brush?	O
Yes.	O
That's what I'm using right now, just to test it out.	O
Because I use color dynamics on the other.	O
Parts of the painting I think it might look more cohesive if I keep doing that.	O
Everywhere.	O
Is it per tip?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
It is applied pro tip?	O
So that way.	O
There's a striping effect that's happening.	O
It's hard to see on the White 'cause.	O
It's just not very intense.	O
Oh, that's OK Andy I'm glad you could make it to the stream since we're working on your photo but don't don't worry at all.	CHITCHAT
I'm totally.	CHITCHAT
OK, with lurking and appreciate you guys being here.	CHITCHAT
I hope you like the painting.	CHITCHAT
These clouds have a lot of like openings where you see to the blue Sky in them like they become kind of pattern.	O
Just as much brush to dissolve some of the edges.	O
Make them look a soft and fluffy I hope that's the goal.	O
Painting Super Cool feels like him, there again.	CHITCHAT
That's like the best thing to hear I'm so glad.	CHITCHAT
So glad Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you again for letting me use your beautiful photo, I might paint some of the other ones eventually too.	CHITCHAT
But this one was my favorite from the first moment that I looked at them.	CHITCHAT
Being bold with cloud shapes.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to make up my own clouds, but make them look like the clouds in the picture, but I'm not following them exactly.	CHITCHAT
Driving down a crazy dirt Rd in the middle of nowhere do you have to have well?	CHITCHAT

The background still seems very vibrant, which I think is pretty but maybe we need to add a little bit more like that fade.	O
Into the distance.	O
Want to lower the opacity so we need to fade that much.	O
But just a little bit.	O
And I'm not sure if.	CHITCHAT
That would work in between these either.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it helps a little bit as that's going into the distance.	O
So before after before after.	O
ETA for ending let's see it's 3:00 o'clock.	CHITCHAT
I think around 3:30.	CHITCHAT
Three 45 so maybe 30 or 45 more minutes.	CHITCHAT
It just depends on how well I do with the finishing.	CHITCHAT
Things and if I need a little extra time or not.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Hello Derek Good morning, Hi Mansor.	CHITCHAT
Alright let me open this link from Andy.	CHITCHAT
The link didn't work, Oh it worked for me.	CHITCHAT
For some reason, but yeah, yeah, there's although the pictures you guys could take a look all and Dogo Pictures.	CHITCHAT
Be there from the trip that.	CHITCHAT
And he went on, and the picture where painting right now is in here, but this ones.	CHITCHAT
Also, these are all very paint rible.	CHITCHAT
This is the chosen one.	CHITCHAT
Look at how cool that spiral is.	CHITCHAT
Amazing thank you for sharing.	CHITCHAT
So let's see how we can work on that left hand side.	O
The Bush on the left hand side.	O
Is that if there's any way that I can do it without the?	O
Texture brushes and kinda just try to do it myself, so I'm going to take 100% desaturated Gray, which looks a green going to little darker and I'm just gonna start scribbling things in and playing with that it's on a new layer.	O
The key is we want the.	O
The Bush to be partially in Shadow and partially in highlight and that's what's going to make it look really cool so up here.	O
We're going to be able to make a big change into the light.	O
I'm trying to stay loose with this.	O
But the Bush is a little bit Top happy, maybe erasing back into it can work.	O
Hey Merrick, thank you.	CHITCHAT
This one was quite an adventure started off using the line tool painting technique and I didn't really like it.	O
But I tried to paint on Top of it with more graphic type brushes like I have a triangle brush and a flat brush that I was using for the most part so it kept a little bit of that feeling that the line tool paintings have, but	O
Not quite the same way just a little bit of.	CHITCHAT
Something different something different I'm glad you like it, though.	CHITCHAT
So this Bush has a lot of Crazy Little.	O
Pieces that come out.	O
Just like it's happening crazy hair day or something.	CHITCHAT

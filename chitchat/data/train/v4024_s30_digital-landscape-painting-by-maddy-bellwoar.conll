And so we can go to the little pieces and now add.	O
Maybe I can move the brush tip shape to do this.	O
That's kind of fun alright let's try shape dynamics.	O
Angle jitter.	O
But they're not a whole at different angles.	O
You just a little bit.	O
When you don't want to draw leaves yourself.	O
Who?	CHITCHAT
We'll see how it looks the idea is just to get like a noisy texture in there.	O
So let's turn on scattering.	O
And then we can do a whole bunch of this.	O
In the middle.	O
Alright so locking that layer.	O
And let's get to Airbrush.	O
Pick a bright color and the idea is this is going to be partially illuminated now that looks crazy, but that's like roughly the idea so.	O
I'm going to make a new layer create clipping mask take that color well, let's go a little warmer with it and.	O
Maybe we do use a texture brush here.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
I really like the gradient.	O
Sometimes it is really fun to do stuff like that because there's all this like preparation and then when you do the overlay color.	O
It's like bam.	CHITCHAT
Super cool.	CHITCHAT
So now we can come back in and add.	O
Individual leaves I'm going to zoom in on the Bush in my reference trying not to zoom into soon both in gets time so now we can add little.	O
Triangles and things.	O
I say I'm just using a triangle brushes to be triangle.	O
And some of the branches can be illuminated too.	O
I don't like those colors.	CHITCHAT
Let's try that again more green more saturated.	O
I like it, I like it.	CHITCHAT
So yeah, maybe I could go back into the.	O
Scattering.	O
Work.	O
Brush tip sheep, Ingle jitter Boo Boo Boo, yeah, we can give some more crazy.	CHITCHAT
Pictures like this.	CHITCHAT
There's an artist that.	CHITCHAT
I met streaming on Twitch, who doesn't stream there anymore, but does really, really cool texture brushes like she creates.	CHITCHAT
Texture brushes in Photoshop for photo shop.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to link to her.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if she's still doing it or if her old brushes are available or name is Sid Wyler.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, photo shop in procreate brushes let's see.	CHITCHAT
And she was a Patris on I'm just going to put it in the chat her brushes are insanely cool and the one that I'm using right now kinda reminds me of like some stuff that she does, but	CHITCHAT
It's all like a lot of foliage and.	CHITCHAT
Some for her and stuff, you can see here, but It's so satisfying to watch like.	CHITCHAT
She's really good at making brushes.	CHITCHAT
You should check that out, if you're interested.	CHITCHAT

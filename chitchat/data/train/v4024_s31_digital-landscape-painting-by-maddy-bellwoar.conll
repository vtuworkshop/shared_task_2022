You can also use a darker color leaves and bring them back into the Top a little bit.	O
Alright so that was fun, I like the Bush.	O
The Andy will hairbrushes the easiest brush to make Oh yeah, I have a feeling I know where you're going with this one.	CHITCHAT
So we need more shadow below the.	O
Bush starting with 5 minutes to remember the name of this thing I Bush Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
Why can I not remember words?	CHITCHAT
When I'm streaming sometimes?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we need to put shadows behind this so that it looks like it's coming forward from that.	O
Yeah, so darker shadows here.	O
That we've plant seems like it's.	O
It's really in there instead of just pasted on Top.	O
Although I don't know if I like that.	CHITCHAT
Maybe the shadows are too like muddy colored.	O
Let's go to Hue saturation and maybe shifted a little bit.	O
Maybe that's more interesting.	O
Oh yeah, and this, this is kind of cool effect.	O
This Bush that we just painted.	O
Has a shadow also and it has those individual little?	O
Affect of the leaves.	O
And then this shadow is more harsh because its shadow of.	O
The rock.	O
So it's kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
So 1 area that I didn't get to work on very much that I would like to add some more detail before we're through is over here on the right.	O
There's all these little shadows.	O
I guess these little plants and so to the right of them.	O
There's shadows going all the way down here.	O
So let's see how this goes.	CHITCHAT
Click this side of the canvas needs a little love.	CHITCHAT
Some more circular.	O
Tufts.	O
Over here.	O
Becca, a little Matchy Matchy.	CHITCHAT
Don't need them all to be the same shape and size that's not so interesting.	O
Hi Angela Good morning, welcome.	CHITCHAT
We're doing, it some.	CHITCHAT
Landscape painting.	CHITCHAT
And I'm kind of putting the finishing touches on right now.	O
I'm working on this area over here that got a little bit.	O
Neglected.	O
So yeah, we can highlight on the left those little.	O
Tufts I just feel like.	O
It might be too noisy.	O
All these kind of details.	O
I'm adding right now, it's going to bring a lot of.' Extra detail and distraction through this so maybe I'll feed that away a little bit.	O

So it'll just be up there closer to focal point.	O
Where we allow some extra level of detail?	O
A little bit here.	O
Over the fixture.	O
I think I'm OK with it.	O
Like details thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm I'm happy with how the details are turning out.	O
I want to add some different color.	O
Green in the foreground.	O
I notice there's some plants.	O
I don't know what they are.	CHITCHAT
But they have like a blue green look to them and they're pretty cool.	O
We do this on on its own layer.	O
But I think that would be a nice thing to add their over here on the side.	O
And it's pretty blue.	O
I'm going to do them on their own layer, so I can add some shadow easily with maybe like a clipping mask or something.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
They're coming up the whole side here and maybe that's nice to show a little bit of' scale perspective like for example?	O
How big they are closer to the corner and then getting further and further away.	O
You're just going to see these little little Tufts and not the full Hey of them.	O
So I will lock that, and add.	O
Shadow at the bottom.	O
Find the right color.	O
Yeah, maybe something like that.	CHITCHAT
And underneath.	O
They also have a pretty hard shadow where they're coming out of the ground.	O
I don't know if I like that.	O
OK.	O
One more color to add to this.	O
This gives it a little bit more dimension.	O
And to do the same thing for these little little.	O
Tufts we can scribble a little bit more in there.	O
Yeah, and their switch random.	O
Plants you know, even though this is.	O
An area that you know it's not super lush you don't think of it that way.	O
But there are a lot of little little things growing different textures, different colors.	O
Different Heights and That makes it interesting.	O
So my only issue right now is I feel like the focal point isn't interesting enough compared to some other areas.	O
So I'm going to go in and focus right on this spot right here.	O
A little bit more.	O
So we can find.	O
Place to add some extra sharp highlights.	O
Where the lights hitting that will help?	O
Some little rocks, getting hit by the light.	O
Also shadows.	O
And shapes.	O
Just add a little bit more.	O
Complication but we don't want to make it busy just for the sake of it being busy so hopefully, I can find some interesting shapes to add.	O

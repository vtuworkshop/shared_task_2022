OK, so next thing.	O
I'm going to make a new layer and use the black paint bucket turn.	O
The layer onto color, Dodge and use the airbrush to put a little bit of glow.	O
Rate in the focal point rate on this rock now color Dodge will definitely add saturation an it will sometimes overexposed after be careful.	O
How much I use maybe I'll lower the opacity an airbrush a little bit.	O
But it just creates such a warm cozy feeling.	CHITCHAT
To seem like this, and really like kind of pumps up the lighting.	O
So within reason, it's nice to add.	O
Oh, I'm sorry Mills.	CHITCHAT
Let me scroll up.	CHITCHAT
Is this too spoopy let's see?	CHITCHAT
It's loading.	CHITCHAT
Ooh that's a really good one.	CHITCHAT
Here's what Mills found.	CHITCHAT
Very like Misty and look at these trees with the roots.	O
All winding around yeah.	O
I think that's a really good reference to make a kind of spooky scene, not too spooky.	CHITCHAT
Just a good amount of spooky.	CHITCHAT
I agree faulty.	CHITCHAT
So I do like the glow I just don't like how.	O
Warm it's making this.	O
It's making the It's making a color supersaturated.	O
Is it already was saturated begin with?	CHITCHAT
But maybe that's not a problem?	CHITCHAT
Let's just keep going and then I'll decide.	O
I think I've done rushed a bit of the start and I shouldn't do it.	CHITCHAT
Let me see Jackson.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, this came out so cool.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
Let me move this out of the way.	CHITCHAT
That looks awesome.	CHITCHAT
This technique over here worked out, so well for this Bush.	CHITCHAT
I love the textures.	CHITCHAT
What the heck to me this is like a really great job lines will painting like this is kind of results.	CHITCHAT
I'd be happy to get if I actually stuck with it.	CHITCHAT
It's so interesting that manages to look painterly and so digital at the same time.	CHITCHAT
I think that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
There's a really good sense of depth there.	CHITCHAT
Ah that's cool you keep doing those if you enjoy them at all.	CHITCHAT
If you enjoy them I think you should keep doing them because that's	CHITCHAT
That's really awesome.	CHITCHAT
Going to lower the color Dodge layer just a little bit.	O
We don't need to go overboard.	O
Let's merge that and then you can see the before and after.	O
And This is why I see if a separate layer.	O
Because we can decide to tone down some of that effect if we want.	O
Yeah, I'm I'm really happy with the Jackson.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you decided to do it.	CHITCHAT
Hey project, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add a little bit of a green glow so this is just taking the.	O
And layer normal, the The layer mode is on normal and I'm just using the Airbrush and like.	O
Popping in a little bit of a glow.	O
You can use layer blending modes, but honestly this works pretty well.	O
If you just want to show that there's a lot of light bouncing around there and creating this like overall luminescent feeling.	O

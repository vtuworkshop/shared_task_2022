And we don't have to make it so intense, but I think it's nice.	O
There's a little more green for us.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I want to experiment with this pathway and making it doing some changes to it.	O
I'm going to go to the selective color and maybe take away a little bit of the saturation.	O
The of their like Reds.	O
And make it a little bit brighter.	O
Have to head to the office painting looks great super cool to watch.	CHITCHAT

Thank you so much for the photo have a good day.	CHITCHAT
Good luck with this weird Wednesday.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I think that's about it at the end.	O
I also sometimes like to go to filter annada sharpen filter 'cause.	O
It really makes the digital brush strokes a little bit more dramatic.	O
You can see like the before and after it also kind of.	O
Causes some damage to the image in a sense, but I think it's really cool filter sharp and see how it.	O
See the effect that it has.	CHITCHAT
Worship.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
You can also sharpen it just specific areas if you want it to be more sharp so.	O
After reset up my toolbar things are all in weird places now but anyway, you can take the sharpen tool an just come into like the focal area and sharpen that up more if you want and you don't have to sharpen like in this case, the clouds and all that stuff.	O
And I guess I should have done this before sharpening but I wanted to try adding a tiny bit of a glow right here.	O
I like that kind of dusty glow look that happens sometimes in these scenarios.	O
Alright I think that's it.	CHITCHAT
I think I think it's finished.	CHITCHAT
Thank you read Thanks you guys.	CHITCHAT
And other tools you can change style quite a lot.	O
The tools you use change style that's so true?	O
That's so true.	CHITCHAT

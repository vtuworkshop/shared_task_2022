There's not a ton in the foreground.	O
We do get a rock formation on the left and some trees on the right which is better than nothing but I really do like the combination of having things closer to the Camera as well as farther away because it helps it makes it easier to show depth in your painting things get really flat if everything is like in the distance.	O
So we'll see if we can maybe exaggerate some of the foreground stuff and make it more interesting.	O
But yeah, I'm going to be doing a painting of this reference.	O
This is from mapcrunch.com.	O
It's a website that takes a Google Street View images.	O
I'm sure you guys that are here all know about this already 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I'm always talking about it, but in case anybody's knew that's what I'm doing and the reference image should be available below the stream so if you want to paint along you can.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
The setup looks different I can't find the reference Oh no really.	CHITCHAT
Well, I can just paste it in the chat as well.	CHITCHAT
But I wonder why?	CHITCHAT
So here's the link to the reference image.	CHITCHAT
And it's also in the discord also is in my discord.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
So if you want to paint along if you like the scene and you want to paint along that would be awesome.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to take the link and do a little sketch or painting with me.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to.	CHITCHAT
Kind of take the reference and do your own thing with it if you have some sort of a particular inspiration.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to try to do a study based on the reference.	O
But maybe just change the foreground things a little bit so.	O
That's my plan.	O
Good grinding some ink tober stuff, Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
It's just about time right are you doing, you're doing all your like plans of exciting.	CHITCHAT
A summer Nina welcome welcome everybody.	CHITCHAT
I hope you'll be able to find a reference image if not.	CHITCHAT
Let me know when I'll just paste the link in the chat.	CHITCHAT
But I'm going to be painting.	CHITCHAT
This image, I'm going to place it on the Top here using pure ref so that.	O
We can just always be on Top of everything well.	CHITCHAT
We're working you can see a little thumbnail view.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm going to do about a 3 hour painting on this so I hope we can get something really nice.	CHITCHAT
By the end, often times when I do virtual Plein Air Studies.	CHITCHAT
There just a little bit longer than an hour so having a 2 or 3 hour.	CHITCHAT
One is really nice.	CHITCHAT
And we can hopefully get a good finish result with it.	CHITCHAT
Terra says it done all my plans, mostly getting a head.	CHITCHAT
Start working on the first two prompts awesome.	CHITCHAT
I can't wait to see it.	CHITCHAT
A cow the stream so high quality on full screen.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy thanks for being here, guys, I hope you enjoy this more high quality stream and.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, there, you go Robert thank you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, exactly that's what I'm using for the reference image.	CHITCHAT
Although I might have to set up some I might have to do some settings in here.	O
Let's see preferences.	O
I always wanted to always stay on Top.	O
Different dates sorry guys I had to reinstall everything on my computer, so nothing has its proper settings like before and I didn't realize I'd have to change something in pure ref.	CHITCHAT
Window.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it's somewhere here mode always on Top there, we go.	O
It's under mode OK solved.	O
Alright so let's get into the painting.	O
There's a link to my brushes under the stream.	O
I hope it's visible to you guys, but if you want you can check that out.	CHITCHAT
And I'm going to also start the tool capture so if you watch the fide if you watch the video if you re watch the video to this dream.	CHITCHAT
You should be able to see the tool timeline captures all the tools that I'm using as I'm painting.	CHITCHAT
Hi Haiti's welcome thanks for coming on over good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Yes, I am an artist, Digital and traditional artist.	CHITCHAT
But we're doing digital art today.	CHITCHAT
You don't see the brushes either.	CHITCHAT
Maybe they're updating something an it's it's causing some trouble with that.	CHITCHAT
The assets are the uploaded assets are visible on my end, but what I can do is maybe update the description under the?	CHITCHAT
Video to include them, too, not sure if I can do that, while I'm alive.	CHITCHAT
So probably not.	CHITCHAT

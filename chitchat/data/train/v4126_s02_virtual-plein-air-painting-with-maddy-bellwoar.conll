Alright we'll see maybe it will update.	CHITCHAT
OK so let's get started painting.	CHITCHAT
At the very least you guys can always join the discord.	CHITCHAT
There's a link to that on my profile.	CHITCHAT
My Behance profile and all of the things are there?	CHITCHAT
It updated OK awesome?	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Well, that's good.	CHITCHAT
OK so I'm going to start with a sketch like usual and I normally try to figure out where the horizon line is going to be 1st in this case.	O
It's somewhat near the middle and I know that's not really optimal.	O
I know we kind of try to avoid that in landscape.	O
I think at this time it kind of fits it kind of works.	O
So we're just going to go with it.	O
Robert says Hey Mattie, been looking at chairs and like the look of yours.	CHITCHAT
What brand was it again.	CHITCHAT
Noble chairs is the is what it's what it's called?	CHITCHAT
The actual model.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I have it off hand but it's Noble chairs.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's the epic thanks cow.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Epic epic chair.	CHITCHAT
Haley.	CHITCHAT
Good to see you.	CHITCHAT
Hope you had a good weekend.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to sketch in the mountains in the distance and you know, maybe we will exaggerate them a little bit more.	O
I think this is actually maybe a cool opportunity to go our own way from the reference a little bit more than usual because for example.	O
I really like the effect of the mountains in the background.	O
But I think it might be more interesting if there more prominently there a little bit larger or maybe there's a little bit more overlapping with things.	O
So I'm going to sketch in my own idea of how high they should be.	O
And maybe it's not so different from the reference but.	O
A little bit of difference here in there.	O
Good time for share it right, it is good good sure.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this isn't like that.	CHITCHAT
My favorite part of this reference my favorite part of this image is the water all the little.	O
Trails of water and they're just silver and beautiful, reflecting light from the Sky.	O
And it's so I don't know it's just right out of a fantasy scene like this something like this could have been in Lord of the rings.	CHITCHAT
I mean, it's a little bit of a different environment, but that kind of epic that kind of level epic.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
No comments it is a very supportive chair I will say that.	CHITCHAT
So one thing that I'm trying to remind myself with these little.	O
Little rivers and things is that we're getting of you very much like a for sure in view.	O
So we're not having a straight down aerial view on these so everything is going to seem pretty narrowed and like kind of distorted or squished, but that's going to help give the?	O
Impression that we're viewing it from this distance.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I could even be a little bit more creative with some of these things also going to copy what I did or cut it onto a separate layer and try one more try one more time So what would be the reason that I couldn't like make my own swirls and stuff, and maybe I can actually make them like Totale Fantasy, an just interesting and maybe.	O
Swirling through like more magical papers shapes that wouldn't necessarily exist.	CHITCHAT
But maybe in this fantasy world.	CHITCHAT
They do to feel like this scene has is like lending itself towards a fantasy total fantasy landscape.	CHITCHAT
Waffle Amari Hi from Belgium, hello from the Netherlands Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome.	CHITCHAT
I am making a painting of the image that you see up here and it's in the description of the stream the link to the.	CHITCHAT
The image so if anybody watching.	CHITCHAT
Would like to you're welcome to also paint with me.	CHITCHAT
Do a little study.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I love these shapes, but I think we'll wait until we get into the painting to really make a lot of changes and figure things out more detailed.	CHITCHAT
Going to merge down what I have so far.	O

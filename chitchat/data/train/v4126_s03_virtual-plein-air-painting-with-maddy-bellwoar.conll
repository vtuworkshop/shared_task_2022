Make a new layer and.	O
I think in this scene.	O
I don't always sketch in clouds ahead of time, but I think there is so important.	O
In this scene.	CHITCHAT
There, a big part of why it's a beautiful scene and they're big part of the composition.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Even though clouds are fluffy and soft.	O
They still have based on create shapes and they can have strong shapes and mass and you know they are important to the composition so.	O
I'm just going to sketch in like the rough outline of where the cloud shapes are going to be.	O
Keep that in mind.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
Another thing I have to think about is the foreground so this is the thing that I want to change the most.	O
Just because I feel like there's not enough overlap from the foreground over Top of like the mid ground and I just feel like it makes it.	O
It's less.	O
It looks kind of flat so.	O
Let's try that new layer.	O
I'm actually going to lower the opacity of what we have here and imagine that it's like in the distance and make a new layer.	O
It will be easier to draw on Top of that and imagine that this is the foreground so over here on the left we have rocks.	O
So that's fine, we can do that.	CHITCHAT
There's like a little.	O
Outcropping.	O
All these different shapes and the rocks like breaking apart that's pretty cool actually.	O
But I think I just made it a little bit bigger in mind, so it's overlapping more and maybe we could do something that really.	O
I don't know put something on it, like maybe we could have a flag or something like somebody somebody came here and.	O
Left their mark or something like that, and that could go up higher or we could have maybe some tree or branches growing out of that.	O
I just think it needs something that's going higher up.	O
If you have any ideas you're welcome to suggest.	CHITCHAT
And I'll add some rocks here.	O
And maybe we'll make this more of a Hill leading down.	O
Instead of flat.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Then we have trees.	O
To do.	O
I'm just going to put the very, very basic shapes of that reasonably little lollipops.	O
You like the flag.	CHITCHAT
I like the flag.	CHITCHAT
I think I think maybe we'll go with the flag just because it's a little bit of A.	O
Hint of a person has been here, maybe a little bit of storytelling.	O
It doesn't really tell much of a specific story.	CHITCHAT
But little hints that it's not just an all natural landscape.	CHITCHAT
But there's always been there.	CHITCHAT
And that that can be kind of cool.	CHITCHAT
So we have trees, maybe the trees are coming up the mountain and they're going to get bigger.	O
Maybe there's a Bush here or something.	O
I'm just having trouble with.	O
The way it currently looks over here, I just think it's not very interesting so.	O
We got our lollipop trees.	O
Let me flip this maybe that'll give me some idea what to do.	O
What to do on the left?	O
Maybe we could make.	O
So part of me is like hesitant to add something that would require a lot of reference without actually finding a good reference for it like it might be nice to have a tree coming up here.	O
But I'm worried about my ability to successfully paint that tree well without any reference for it.	O
Maybe a Bush or something.	O
Another thing is, we have these rocks, maybe there's like a path if we want to keep going.	O
With the idea that like some people have been here or something like that.	O
Maybe we can make a rocky.	O
A little path of stones coming back up here.	O
We can have our little flag.	O
And.	O
Put a bear nice one.	O
I think a tree would be easier for me than a bear on the fly to be honest.	O
But I think that is a cool idea.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I like the pathway a flag makes me think almost that someone has just arrived and just like put their flag in there, so I don't know if a whole pathway would be good.	O

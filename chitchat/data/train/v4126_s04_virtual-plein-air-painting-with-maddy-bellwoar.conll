Yeah, let's just try a Bush.	O
Some routes.	O
Maybe there can be rocks over here, too, and the Bush is like.	O
Growing out in between the rocks.	O
Sheep to the tree.	O
A small house that's a cute idea.	O
If I had if I had more time.	O
I might go with some of those options, but I think I'm going to stick with like.	CHITCHAT
Organic stuff this time around just for the amount of time I have to paint this.	CHITCHAT
Today I think I better stick with.	O
Organic things I find it a little bit easier to paint on the fly.	O
Stuff that requires perspective and things well.	O
This should be an interesting one, I don't know how I feel about it, but yet.	CHITCHAT
Let's try.	CHITCHAT
So we got a sketch an I will put that on multiply.	O
Modan lower the opacity so I can just barely see that.	O
Oh, a sundial.	CHITCHAT
Hey Power Hornet.	CHITCHAT
Yogi Ali Yogi Bear, my my uncle when I was growing up used to do.	CHITCHAT
Impressions of cartoon characters and he would do impression of Yogi Bear, just like making my sister laugh.	CHITCHAT
So anyone who's just coming in.	CHITCHAT
We're doing a landscape painting of this beautiful scene, but I'm trying to be a little bit brave and change some things up.	CHITCHAT
But I'm not being quite as Braves of some some are you guys, adding bears and houses and stuff, but I am going to change up the the environment just a little bit from the reference so.	CHITCHAT
That will be fun.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we're about to start so layers on multiply.	O
I put the Opacity 26% an unlocking it so I.	O
Can I stream or again her reading and speaking at the same time try this again I can paint underneath the layer and not.	CHITCHAT
Not accidentally paint on my sketch layer.	CHITCHAT
But welcome power and I'm glad he found the stream, yeah, thanks for thanks for coming on over.	CHITCHAT
Ah Mills.	CHITCHAT
All during the next painting for sure.	CHITCHAT
I haven't done one in awhile well.	CHITCHAT
I am actually this is going to be kind of short stream is going to be out for 3 hours long story going to be about 3 hours long.	CHITCHAT
We're just going to do this one painting so there's like plenty of time.	CHITCHAT
If you want to join in.	CHITCHAT
We only just began so it's up to you.	CHITCHAT
If this one appeals to you if you like it.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome to just below the stream.	CHITCHAT
There's all the information with the reference image where you can get the reference image so.	CHITCHAT
If you like it, you're welcome to join us on this one or you can always just do your own thing?	CHITCHAT
Whatever whatever you like.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
I think I would like to do something similar to the last painting that I did hear and begin with a textured background and just kind of focus on the colours first because I think that's what's so beautiful about this image.	O
I think if it was in black and white it wouldn't quite have the same punch.	O
I do think the values and that bright shine.	O
Here are really important, but the colours ads so, so much.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to start out focusing on that.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Going to grab the Airbrush.	O
And I'm just going to try to get the right colors in the right places and then we're going to get into as soon as possible.	O
I'll get into some texturing stuff.	O
But I'm going to start with the Airbrush and just you know.	O
Pretend almost that you are squinting your eyes.	CHITCHAT
I don't like to actually squint my eyes and look at the references that just gives me a headache, but If you have that kind of mindset.	CHITCHAT
And then we can go.	O
Right into the green.	O
Bright yellow green.	O
The info tab is Top right info.	CHITCHAT
Next to chat.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Robert OK, cool, so I think that's where the?	CHITCHAT
The the assets must have gone the.	CHITCHAT
The information that we can upload here.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to now we have the Sky blocked in and I'm going to now make a selection of the?	O

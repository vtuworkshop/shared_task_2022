Mountains just going to use the lasso tool like a little.	O
Stencil and block off that area.	O
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you're painting along power horn.	CHITCHAT
If anyone else wants to join in.	CHITCHAT
You're welcome, too.	CHITCHAT
I hope I hope you enjoy this painting, either way for just hanging out.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to make a selection of the opposite side.	O
And do a little bit of a darker color.	O
For the mountain.	O
And so we start to get a little bit of that feed.	O
Wow, my smudge brush does not need to be so intense.	O
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
There we go I'm going to put my smudge brush at.	O
I usually like it were between like 10 and 30%.	O
It was at 100, so that's way too much.	O
Even that's too much.	CHITCHAT
The assets show now but we're in there at the beginning OK.	O
Well, I'm glad we got it working now.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
That some distant more distant mountain speaking through over here.	O
And then below that we can begin with the green.	O
So we want a dark blue green.	O
Basically, we just want a nice gradient.	O
It's going to fade from these mountains all the way.	O
To the Area closer to us.	O
Looks like a little bit of a mess to start off with but.	O
Just going to merge everything.	O
Except the sketch.	O
So it does eventually get to be a pretty yellow.	O
Green here and I think that's nice compared to the.	O
More blue green.	O
Is this kind of like an underpainting not really to be honest?	O
This is just like just going into the painting without an underpainting.	O
I think.	CHITCHAT
I do that I tend to use an underpainting when the painting itself is.	CHITCHAT
There's a few times when I'll do it.	CHITCHAT
It's not always, I will always do it in this case.	CHITCHAT
I just felt like the painting itself had so many different colors in it already that it didn't.	O
I just kind of wanted to go in and start painting the color.	O
Sometimes I use an underpainting to try to bring in extra colors that aren't really in the scene or like a color that I.	O
Yeah, this would be a block in rightly like this isn't so much of an underpainting 'cause.	O
It would have been.	O
Maybe if I picked like a warm Brown or orange back there, and then started painting on Top painting on Top of it that would have been warned of an underpainting.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
I just wanted to focus on the very clean, vibrant gradient in this one.	O
I'm sure you guys like have seen we've talked about it before an?	CHITCHAT
I usually Have a different slick a tiny bit of a different workflow for different paintings and this is just something that I think all artists will have a little bit of experience with it's like you have a general workflow, but then from scene to scene or character to character whatever it is that you're doing you're going to take the steps a tiny bit different is not always going to be the same.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, Robert Yeah, you can share a brush that you like.	CHITCHAT
Purples I usually use I usually choose warm underpaintings.	O
If I do use them.	O
So it wouldn't necessarily be for Purples, it would be for something like.	O
Like burnt orange or something a little bit more.	O
This is me personally, I do like to add purpose.	O
Asshat shadows and things.	O
But that's something that I usually just paint in.	O
I don't usually use purple as an underpainting color in my digital art.	O
But it's not say Never do.	O

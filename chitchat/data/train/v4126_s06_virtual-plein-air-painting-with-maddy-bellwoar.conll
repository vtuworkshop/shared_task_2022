It is just that I usually choose when I do under paintings.	O
I usually choose warm colors.	O
So I'm using a?	CHITCHAT
Paint brush right now that's Soft, but does have a little bit of an edge and I think this is nice for starting to get some kind of texture in the Sky.	O
So I'm just just painting what I see as the background gradient behind the clouds and then we're going to add the clouds on Top of this.	O
Hi Liars, Who magentas to the shadows yes magentas magenta is always fun?	CHITCHAT
It's funny in traditional painting how strong that pigment is I have so much magenta paint.	O
Enjoy your frequently.	CHITCHAT
Hope you're all doing good.	CHITCHAT
If you have any questions, let me know.	CHITCHAT
So now on the left and in the sort of middle of the canvas.	O
I'm going to begin with just having painting in a little bit of overlapping details and things to show these.	O
Groups of treason and stuff in between the.	CHITCHAT
In between all of the.	O
Areas of water little rivers and things so I wanted to look like there's really some depth and distance here, so we want some silhouettes of.	O
You know mountains and we want some depth so for example, back here we have one level of blue and then we can have a darker.	O
A darker blue here and then it starts to look like this is a little bit closer to us just like on the left.	O
Same thing happening on the right.	O
It's a little bit more subtle.	O
From Brazil welcome.	CHITCHAT
Welcome welcome I am from the United States, but I'm living in the Netherlands.	CHITCHAT
Are you still using airbrush I am using the?	O
Brush that's like an airbrush but it has a hard edge a little bit of a hard edge is the soft shading and blending brush.	O
I'm just using it to now give like the first layer of.	O
Detail to what's going on here instead of it being so, so smooth now will have a little bit of texture going on, but it's not a lot you know.	O
So there is not I'm looking at the reference.	CHITCHAT
In this area.	O
I do see opportunity for a little bit more.	O
Some more warmer colors than what I painted in with just the Blues and greens so they'll be opportunities for some little bit of purple and magenta is and Browns to show through.	O
And actually be careful.	O
I'm gonna end up just making some really muddy colors here, but Just playing with blending right now.	O
Might even be nice to turn off the sketch layer for a little bit since I'm not actually working on the foreground.	O
Just kind of get it out of the way so I can see what I'm painting better.	O
This is a detailed one power Hornet my biggest suggestion is to start with like this, a simple simple gradient don't get.	CHITCHAT
In there to details right at the beginning just try to paint like Blue Sky Green on the bottom get that mountain to get that hard edge for the mountain and it's amazing.	CHITCHAT
It can start to look like this scene pretty quick and then you can go in and do.	CHITCHAT
The details but you don't need to get in there with a small brush like at the beginning.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
But Hey, just try to have some fun with it.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
You can share if you like but no pressure at all.	CHITCHAT
Just enjoy your painting.	CHITCHAT
So we get some lines of trees coming through here and I really like that look so I'm just going to skip them in same brush.	O
I think this one is going to be challenging for me, too.	CHITCHAT
It's one of those that at the beginning.	CHITCHAT
It's going well.	CHITCHAT
But as soon as we get to the foreground.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to have my hands full of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Will enjoy it feeling inspired by my last drawing that's awesome.	CHITCHAT

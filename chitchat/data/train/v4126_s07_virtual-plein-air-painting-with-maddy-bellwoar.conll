I'm glad to hear that?	CHITCHAT
That's such a good feeling you definitely gotta keep going when you're when you're feeling that kind of energies your art.	CHITCHAT
Thanks hating.	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
In fact, And.	CHITCHAT
It's good to see you good to be here.	CHITCHAT
I'll be keeping in touch with you guys about.	CHITCHAT
Some schedule changes, I think I'm going to be announcing some schedule changes this week.	CHITCHAT
Because.	CHITCHAT
I'm beginning classes tonight actually I'm starting my language class again.	CHITCHAT
And things are just a little crazy, so I might for the for the winter.	CHITCHAT
While I'm doing a lot.	CHITCHAT
An honestly just in general.	CHITCHAT
Things have been so crazy for me.	CHITCHAT
Lately, like I'll talk to you more about it later.	CHITCHAT
But my schedule of what days I'm streaming where an everything I will.	CHITCHAT
I will update you guys this week with like?	CHITCHAT
How things are going to be for the winter and maybe when I.	CHITCHAT
Will will will have a different schedule in the summer next year like?	CHITCHAT
What we did this year.	CHITCHAT
Because of the metal study now I like drawing shiny stuff.	CHITCHAT
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
I love painting, shiny stuff.	CHITCHAT
It's so much fun you can get a lot of.	CHITCHAT
I don't know it.	CHITCHAT
Just you get a lot of bang for your book with that paper texture.	CHITCHAT
I feel like it's once you get, how to do it.	CHITCHAT
It's it's really, really cool effects.	CHITCHAT
And I think compared to some other textures, metal texture isn't necessarily the most time consuming to paint.	CHITCHAT
I think that sometimes soft textures with a lot of less shiny things soft textures.	CHITCHAT
Will be?	CHITCHAT
A little bit more.	CHITCHAT
Like detail detail intensive I don't know sorry I'm not explaining it well.	CHITCHAT
That means you will be streaming earlier no no that's not going to be at Lee don't worry, it's not going to change the time, but I think.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'll post outpost in the discord probably tonight about it.	CHITCHAT
Hey Nadella, Thanks for coming.	CHITCHAT
I hope you had a good weekend.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
I still haven't been able to get this.	O
Interesting shape in the in the middle here.	O
I think I'm going to switch to a brush that's a little bit of a harder edge because as we're getting closer and closer.	O
To the foreground, we maybe don't need such a?	O
Such a blurry softer brush we want things to appear more solid.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
On the left.	O
I like these little lines of trees.	O
I'm going to paint in the shadow underneath of them.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Hi Dinner,	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
And use a harder edge brush to paint in these.	O
Little trees here.	O
Well, they might be really big trees, actually but they're kind of far away, so they look small.	O
I think they need to be a little bit more blue and maybe it would be nice to use.	O
I forgot to brush settings to use color dynamics.	O
We can check uncheck apply per tip.	O
And this will mean that each brush stroke.	O
I make it will have a slightly slightly different Hue depending on what I settings.	O
I put here with the huge jitter and saturation jitter and all that stuff.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I don't usually like to mess with the brightness jitter, too much.	O
I think that.	O
Changing the value.	O
Takes too much out of my control instead of hard round brush.	O
It is the wet paint brush in my painterly brush set it's not round.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I did something bad.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
Something froze up over here.	CHITCHAT
This isn't supposed to happen.	CHITCHAT

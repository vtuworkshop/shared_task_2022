I'm so this did not have tech issues now.	CHITCHAT
Alright I'm just going to wait and see if my computer will unfreeze itself.	CHITCHAT
'Cause I don't want to lose my progress.	CHITCHAT
Up.	CHITCHAT
Do patiently waiting I wonder what I did.	CHITCHAT
Looks like a flat brush.	O
Yeah, it's the it's the it's a very nice brush.	O
It's originally.	CHITCHAT
We're back.	O
We're back.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what I did, but I'm not going to do it again.	CHITCHAT
Let's save.	O
The fact that I do alright so this is what the brush looks like.	O
I think it has a nice look of it really reminds me of when.	O
I'm doing gouache painting if I'm using like a round brush in my traditional painting and I.	O
Have like a good amount of paint on the brush.	O
This is really like the kind of effect that it has like this.	O
This is one of the brushes that really reminds me of traditional paint.	O
And it doesn't have the kind of stereotypical oil paint look that a lot of the brushes have that are trying to imitate traditional.	O
I think most most of the photo shop brushes that try to imitate traditional mediums, they seem to be very.	O
Structured around oil paint look.	O
So I'm really kind of struggled to find stuff that.	CHITCHAT
Resembles the gouache paint look that I that I like.	CHITCHAT
And people just paint with different mediums in different styles.	CHITCHAT
Like I've downloaded a lot of Gouache.	CHITCHAT
Extra brushes photoshopped wash texture brushes and I'm just like what this isn't how.	CHITCHAT
Gosh, she looks to me, it just depends how you paint with it.	CHITCHAT
Funny.	CHITCHAT
Like I really like the Kyle Webster Gouache brushes.	O
I just they don't look at all like how I paint with Gouache.	O
So I find it kind of funny but they are really nice brushes and very cool.	O
Traditional brush textures, and I like to use them sometimes.	O
So yeah, I'm just going around.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Having some little trees and.	O
Trying to show the distance between these areas.	O
I probably shouldn't be doing so much without putting anything in the foreground honestly.	O
But I'm enjoying this.	CHITCHAT
Part of the painting so we'll do a little bit more.	O
And then I'll go with the foreground and start cleaning stuff out, they don't regret it.	O
Trying to clear pic there, we go that's the color.	O
Alright I'll merge that down and let's put the sketch back and I'm going to switch brushes to something flat.	O
Reuse the Mattie brush the classic my favorite.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm having a problem with my menus.	CHITCHAT
Doesn't happen in awhile but everything's Oh my gosh everything's?	CHITCHAT
Still, a weird guys, I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I think I just have to get everything set up.	CHITCHAT
I think there might be some windows ink thing I need to disable.	CHITCHAT
I remember doing something with wind windows ink when I first.	CHITCHAT
Got my.	CHITCHAT
My centriq an now.	CHITCHAT
With having reinstalled everything and I did a fresh install of everything over the weekend.	CHITCHAT
I try to get everything ready for stream today, but I'm still having like little things go wrong, I might have to restart photo shop real quick.	CHITCHAT
See if that does anything.	CHITCHAT
But let's email says to even with working back to front big to small you still have to have most of the foreground planned out early.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like to make sure I don't get my painting in a situation where anyone area is like too far along compared to any other area because then you run into a situation where you just can't visualize the whole scene.	CHITCHAT

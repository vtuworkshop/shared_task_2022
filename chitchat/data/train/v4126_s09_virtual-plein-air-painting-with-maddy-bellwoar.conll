You just don't.	CHITCHAT
You can't plan out the value structure.	O
The colors, the composition of everything and it's.	O

But in the short term.	CHITCHAT
I have to get everything set up again, and working together and you kind of realize all these little settings and things that you have to do I thought you try to think of everything but then, when you actually go and you're using stuff that's when you realize.	CHITCHAT
I gotta fix this so I gotta fix that.	CHITCHAT
Fine.	CHITCHAT
Not right, yeah, so it's like one of those things that is so wonderful once it's done but actually doing it all is like Oh no.	CHITCHAT

There's a lot of purple shadows in the rocks.	O
That's another reason to choose it's like the base color.	O
And I'm going to lock that layer and have to decide what to do next and what I mean, is usually I'll try to decide do I want to make the do I want to do shadows 1st?	O
Or highlights what is the more dominant thing so the rocks have pretty even amount of Shadow and highlight.	O
I think so it doesn't make a big difference.	O
I'm going to choose.	O
And textured brush this is called us sponge brush in my brush set and it just has a little bit rough texture like this.	O
So we can create a clipping mask so that's clipped onto the shape of the rocks and then just.	O
Start painting in shadows of the rock texture.	O
There's a couple of ways to do this.	O
You can make a selection to make a little bit of a stencil effect again and then I can paint behind there.	O
Are you stylizing this piece?	CHITCHAT
Yes.	CHITCHAT
So I almost always am stylizing?	CHITCHAT
When I'm doing a virtual plane air to some degree will come out more realistic than others.	O
But The thing is I just can't.	CHITCHAT
Indiana relatively short time, like 1 to 3 hours.	CHITCHAT
I can't get like super super realistic usually.	CHITCHAT
So it's always my goal to Stylize, a little bit now when you say stylized you can mean anything from like?	CHITCHAT
Slightly simplifying shapes too.	CHITCHAT
Drawing a complete cartoon style, like there's all different levels of stylization and So what I'm trying to do when I'm stylizing is just really emphasized that shapes that I see try to kind of summarize them and do something.	CHITCHAT
That makes the image like easily digestible.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
For example, to look at the scene and really understand the shapes very, very well and very in an obvious way.	CHITCHAT
So I don't want to necessarily paint every little detail.	O
I want it to be.	O
Like a cleaner easier to look at version of the original.	O
Buffering BV hands is quite frequent.	CHITCHAT
I wonder.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if that's another problem from me.	CHITCHAT
I can check in after the stream.	CHITCHAT
And see.	CHITCHAT
The.	CHITCHAT
The people here at Adobe be hands have been super helpful with like getting everything set up for the stream and helping you work through some of my tech issues and stuff, so maybe I can.	CHITCHAT
Talk to them after the stream and see if something on my end is causing this problem what you guys are experiencing right now.	CHITCHAT
In OBS to me everything is going good like it's all in the green there right now.	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
They could still be something.	CHITCHAT
Causing it that I don't know about.	CHITCHAT
So the light in the scene is coming from it's very clear.	O
You can see in the sun in the center very bright and very, very intense and also so we can keep in mind that all the shadows are all going to be on the side.	O
The rocks that are facing to us.	O
Over here on the right same thing.	O
So anything on the right side of the rocks.	O
Wherever facing us is going to be a little bit darker.	O
So I don't like how purple the rocks are right now, but we're working our way to more natural situation soon.	O
I'm going to create a clipping mask color pic from the Roxanne move it a little bit warmer.	O
And see about going to the next step.	O
So I think I'm gonna go back to the Mattie brush.	O
Maybe an start painting in just a couple edges here and there that will have this kind of color.	O
Alright so some of you are having it and some not so much the buffering.	CHITCHAT
So I'm not sure but either way, I hope it hope it stops.	CHITCHAT
For those of you who are having it so you can enjoy the stream.	CHITCHAT

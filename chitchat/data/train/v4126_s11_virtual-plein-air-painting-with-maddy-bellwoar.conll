You're getting so much faster with rock shape, so thanks.	CHITCHAT
I was actually just thinking, Man, I need to practice rock shapes.	CHITCHAT
I think you're right that I am getting faster with them, but I'm also feeling puzzled about.	CHITCHAT
Like.	CHITCHAT
The textures right now, I'm thinking to myself, I'm trying to figure out like what brushes I want to use.	CHITCHAT
You want to just.	CHITCHAT
Painted in the flat brush and just kind of create all my own textures, but it can it's not we don't have time for that.	CHITCHAT
In a Shorter painting session in a time study and I like the idea of you know the textured brushes.	CHITCHAT
Giving some more personality to the rocks so one experiment them.	CHITCHAT
It's buffering for you.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry guys.	CHITCHAT
Next we can make a lighter highlight finally on the rocks.	O
Clipping mask and it's going to be something brighter and warmer and this is where the sun is hitting.	O
And I think this would be a good time to use a texture brush.	O
And that just seems really, really bright.	O
Maybe we're not ready to go to that highlight yet.	O
There is one other thing that I'm noticing about the rocks.	O
They have a lot of blue bounce light on them.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
We can take this blue purple like periwinkle color and just start giving some.	O
Some highlights this is light blue light from the Sky.	O
Hitting within the some of the shadow areas.	O
You have a 4K monitor I do not I do not.	CHITCHAT
That would be cool.	CHITCHAT
The rocks are really pretty thank you tell a thank you alright.	CHITCHAT
Well, I appreciate the feedback you guys feel.	CHITCHAT
Feel more optimistic about the rocks.	CHITCHAT
I like these.	O
Shapes with the rocks are kind of cracking apart and you get like these tears.	O
There's no, I'm talking about.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to turn off the sketch layer now 'cause I think it's just distracting me, but you get.	O
You can't like these lines and.	O
Areas with rocks, like breaking away.	O
This is a sharp shadow.	O
OK, I was kind of afraid like well.	O
I'm going to get into too much detail but maybe I can just at least add a few of them.	O
Yeah, up here there will be some highlights and then it will help stand help the rock stand out against the background right now, it's the edges, a bit muddy.	O
I hope you guys are doing well if you're working on some of your own paintings and projects and things I hope it's all going well.	CHITCHAT
Alright I think I do like Hella Rock is going finally.	O
I do have to be fair to the rest of the rocks.	O
We need to add some detail to them.	O
If this one is going to be all fancy.	O
So let's see.	CHITCHAT
One here.	O
We can show that breaking apart.	O
Almost finished your first inktober prompt that's awesome.	CHITCHAT

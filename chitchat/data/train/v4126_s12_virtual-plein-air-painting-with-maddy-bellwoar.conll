Hi Andrew Welcome.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, gnutella Can you believe that?	CHITCHAT
It's just snuck up on us.	CHITCHAT
But that's OK, you don't have to prepare I mean.	CHITCHAT
When you say you don't have anything if you don't actually have any like ink supplies that might be a problem?	CHITCHAT
Could use a ballpoint pen, though?	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's Andy low OK, Hey, thanks for coming.	CHITCHAT
Get to see you.	CHITCHAT
Um do they May 1st year participating in October.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we have to make an inktober channel in the discord.	CHITCHAT
So everyone can share their October things there.	CHITCHAT
Because we need more channels in the discord of course.	CHITCHAT
Have alcohol markers does that count.	CHITCHAT
I mean?	CHITCHAT
I think it's fine.	CHITCHAT
I think anytime you're painting with something that's permanent medium.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty in the spirit of.	CHITCHAT
October.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, they're very it's flexible.	CHITCHAT
Just taking a look at the time and we have 2 hours left to paint this so I'm just going to keep taking my time with the rocks because?	CHITCHAT
I think there is enough time for me to do something decent with them.	CHITCHAT
Gonna take my time and then will work will move on to other areas of painting in a little bit.	CHITCHAT
But I do want to work on.	O
All the rocks so we gotta get these little ones working over here on the right.	O
This is not in the reference at all, so we gotta wing it.	O
But we can still look at the reference like I'm still looking at the rocks.	O
The.	CHITCHAT
The left portion of.	O
What's in the reference 'cause I can still use that to paint this?	O
Now, Susie.	CHITCHAT
Hey good to see you thanks for coming.	CHITCHAT
Should I make it or do you wanna make things over channel later?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that's cool mails that that's very nice of you?	CHITCHAT
Thank you if you want to make it that's that's great.	CHITCHAT
I was, I wanted to pin the official prompt list.	CHITCHAT
There just let everyone know they can also do whatever prompt list that they want.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's right that's very waffle, you can change that, if you want to.	CHITCHAT
But as long as you're OK with it.	CHITCHAT
So we're painting the reference you see at the Top an I'm changing it up a little bit, not anything too, crazy, but I am doing.	O
Adding some stuff to the right, adding some rocks and trees.	O
I just wanted there to be more things closer up.	O
To the viewer in the scene.	O
I thought that it was a little bit.	O
It was a little bit missing that.	O
Congratz bail.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to flip 'cause I've been painting from the one angle for awhile and yeah.	O

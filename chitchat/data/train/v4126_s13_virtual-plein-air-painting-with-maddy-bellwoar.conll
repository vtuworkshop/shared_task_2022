It's the second you flip things seem a little bit wonky.	O
But we are on the side of a mountain so.	O
Can work?	CHITCHAT
Continuing on with the details and that little bit of.	O
Rock.	O
Like texture of the horizontal stripes.	O
Kind of falling apart a little bit.	O
And I think we're ready now to add some highlights.	O
So going to do on a separate layer in case I don't like how it goes.	O
Another thing is, we could just go to the image adjust color balance and maybe I can brighten things up.	O
A little bit as they are like just a little bit warmer.	O
In the highlights shadows could be.	O
A little bit more Siam.	O
Have you tried painting in VR?	CHITCHAT
I have not I have not at all.	CHITCHAT
I've heard some good things about it?	CHITCHAT
It seems fun seems like something fun to try but I have no experience but.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I'm going to start with layer one of warm highlights.	O
On Top of the rock.	O
So I'm just looking at the reference to guide me on where these highlights are honestly.	O
We're going to have to do a little bit.	O
Uh applied study on the other rock 'cause we're kind of making up our own.	O
Rock so then we can try to figure out for ourselves where the highlights are going to go.	O
Thanks Mills, thank you for updating the discord.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so this, the highlights on the rocks are so pretty and there's so many little different Hue variations.	O
It's going to take a couple of passes to get this looking good, I think.	O
So there is a first pass and let you bring some highlights over here to figure out where they want to go.	O
And then we can go a little bit later.	O
Just a couple of places.	O
And I want to bring more of the light blue too.	O
I don't think I did enough of that, so color pick?	O
What there is now.	O
And go a little bit brighter.	O
Little bit brighter.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	O
Feels.	CHITCHAT
Feels off but I think I'm just going to commit to it.	O
Mill so see you give the rocks.	CHITCHAT
The jagged rough look by doing the highlights on a clipped layer with a rectangle brush.	O
That is what I'm doing yes, you are following the process well.	CHITCHAT
I don't know that that's necessarily.	CHITCHAT
The thing that's giving it through a rough jagged look, though I think that comes with the.	O
The shapes and I do think the contrast helps with that, but I think it has to do a lot with the shapes an the texture of the brushes like going with a little bit of a texture brush.	O
We had is part of it.	O
And emerged the highlights down on 2.	O
The rock.	O
I think it's nice to use a clipping mask Mills because I wasn't sure how I was going to like what I did I wasn't sure if it was going to be.	O
The right choice.	O
And how was painting it so that's why I used a clipping mask if I was feeling more confident.	O
I could have just painted it right on to the layer like the clipping mask isn't really.	O
Necessarily important.	O
It's just it's more flexible.	O
Hey Mizore good to see you miss sorry was this your.	CHITCHAT

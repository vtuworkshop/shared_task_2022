Did you find this image?	CHITCHAT
I was like remembering that you found this one, but I don't know if that's correct.	CHITCHAT
But Hey, good to see you.	CHITCHAT
And let's see Robert says I'm thinking, Inktober has to be monochrome, but it can be colored inks, too, yes, it can.	CHITCHAT
It can.	CHITCHAT
And there's actually if you like the monochrome thing.	CHITCHAT
With different hues, there's something called Hugh Vember.	CHITCHAT
This also goes around, I guess that's November right.	CHITCHAT
Q Vember is something kind of cool for that.	CHITCHAT
Did this and I hate it OK?	CHITCHAT
Let me see let me see what's going on?	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's so cozy why do you hate it?	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna share really quick this is something Missouri painted in the chat.	CHITCHAT
It's really nice.	CHITCHAT
This is a yeah seems like this with a lot of.	CHITCHAT
With perspective and all these kind of details, architectural things.	CHITCHAT
It's not necessarily easy one to do so it's good that you're practicing those hi there huxel.	CHITCHAT
I like the little smoke coming out of the chimney.	CHITCHAT
Alright so little more highlight on the side of the rocks facing towards.	O
The light I can't wait to get started on the clouds.	O
That's going to be next after just a little bit more rock painting.	O
Yeah, those people were just coming in if you want to see the reference image.	CHITCHAT
I'm using you can check the description below this stream or the info.	CHITCHAT
Info button.	CHITCHAT
You can download it if you like the image and if you'd like to give it a try.	CHITCHAT
Very out of my comfort zone.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I understand it took me a really long time to be willing to paint buildings and houses and things I started with just purely landscapes, only natural landscapes and I wasn't interested in doing any man made structures.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
It's a big step at first.	CHITCHAT
Because there's a lot of different challenges that come into it.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thinking is already.	CHITCHAT
I think it's better if you turn off the silence muting option.	CHITCHAT
What does that mean?	CHITCHAT
Can you explain that in another way?	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry I don't know what you mean?	CHITCHAT
I don't actually have any filters on OBS right now, so maybe I do need one or something but I the only thing I have is noise gate.	CHITCHAT
But I don't have like sound noise suppression filter.	CHITCHAT
I'd really like noise suppression filter.	CHITCHAT
It usually makes me sound like underwater or something.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Actually, a very little going on, but that there could still be something up with audio I'm trying to Figure it out after reinstalling everything over this weekend so a lot of my preferences and things were changed.	CHITCHAT
Oh, it's something with with the website huxel.	CHITCHAT
It's not something something with my stream.	CHITCHAT
Just checking because everything is different for me from last week today.	CHITCHAT
So I'm hoping that I'm not I'm not having some problems.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, structures machinery all that stuff, even.	CHITCHAT
Like if you're drawing a character with weapons or some kind of crazy props and stuff, those things can all be really difficult.	CHITCHAT
So the perspective and.	CHITCHAT
Mathematical type.	CHITCHAT
Stuff that's involved sometimes.	CHITCHAT
Painted on the wrong layer now.	CHITCHAT
Hi Joseph, Whenever there is no loud sound in the stream.	CHITCHAT
It goes absolutely silent, so gives kind of lagging effect OK well.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the feedback.	CHITCHAT
I will try to listen back to the stream after it's over and see if I can improve anything.	CHITCHAT
Right so I'm turning off the sketch layer.	O
And just doing some painting, I kind of like the color green of the reference as it gets.	O
The scene gets closer and closer to us.	O
There's a little bit of like a soft blue green color.	O

I mean look at it's all over the place this looks awesome and the jewels in the pearls.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, your textures look really good here.	CHITCHAT
Wish it was original there's a lot going on there like holy cow.	CHITCHAT
Hey project, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you thank you.	CHITCHAT
Guys we should probably start painting the Sky huh?	O
I've been kind of slacking off on that part of this.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's let's do it.	CHITCHAT
I want to keep the foreground on separate layer.	O
So emerged this stuff down so here's my layers right now at this as a background.	O
I have all the rocks and then I have a sketch.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I could again no just look at the colour balance of the rock layer and see if there's any little bit of huge thing I can do so that it, fits better in the scene.	O
I just don't want to take all the purple away 'cause.	O
I think it's a cool thing about it, but I also do you want it to feel like it?	O
It belongs in the scene so?	O
Maybe something like that, it's a little better by undo.	O
Redo.	O
It's OK.	O
Yeah, let's paint some clouds.	O
Paint some clouds so I will choose I will use the same brush right now because.	O
I want some workers consistency and the texturing of this painting.	O
And I think you know, we can just paint on Top.	O
With smooth, smooth, it out those softer brush, which is to start with.	O
Up.	O
So I'm going to color pic to look at the look at the reference so if I color pic from the mountains here, an I pick and I go to my color wheel and I select a little bit of a lighter color and Hue shift a little bit towards purple.	O
Maybe in and lower the opacity.	O
I'm not opacity sorry lower the saturation that should get us closer to the color of the clouds so it wasn't right on.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Just can colors are relative so if I'm painting the clouds right next to the mountain.	O
It kinda helps me decide what color to paint the clouds if I start with the color of the mountain and paint pick a color of the clouds like in.	O
In proportion to that.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Again, I've changed a few things about this scene, I made the mountains more.	O
At all on the left.	O
I think it's going to be easier to.	O
Paint and maybe a little bit more of the purple then needed and then.	O
Add some highlights but it's going to be back and forth is going to be back and forth here, so that's Why?	O
I'm just going to keep working on a separate layer.	O
Nice color for the center here it's so bright.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to keep going with.	O
The clouds over here.	O
And I want a little bit of these soft Misty kind of clouds.	O
So I'm just going to do the same brush.	O
I have transfer on the brush settings.	O

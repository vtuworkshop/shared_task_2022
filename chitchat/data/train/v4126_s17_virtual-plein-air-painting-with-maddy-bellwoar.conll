So I can just paint a little bit lighter and it should.	O
Should be fine we flip the reference?	O
You can also paint in with a hard edge brush and then use the smudge brush to make a little bit.	O
Of soft like dissolve feeling to the clouds.	O
Because I think that's really pretty.	CHITCHAT
So I want to introduce that.	O
Warmer color 2.	O
So to be honest, I don't I haven't done a ton of cloud.	CHITCHAT
Painting.	CHITCHAT
And.	CHITCHAT
I would like to do some.	CHITCHAT
Some I've done cloud painting within within.	CHITCHAT
Landscape painting, but I want to do some actual cloud studies.	CHITCHAT
Soon am I think that will that will help with painting these in the landscape scenes.	CHITCHAT
Paint clouds with FF it's the best cloud.	CHITCHAT
Thanks hope so.	CHITCHAT
I think that to get a cloud cloud scape like this, you have a lot of overlapping different kinds of clouds like wispy ones, and then you have.	O
You know, some more bold clouds on Top, but have a more defined shape.	O
You gotta kind of layer the clouds to get.	O
You know to where you want.	O
So I'm choosing you brush that's called flat wispy it sounds like a good one for cloud painting right.	O
This is also one that I like to use for clouds that are.	O
You know would be has a very soft look through it.	O
So instead of painting with a hard or brush and smashing it out.	O
You could actually just use a softer brush.	O
But I kind of like to use a combination of all these things 'cause.	O
I don't know what I like yet and sometimes I feel like really mixing it up a lot helps get all the different textures that are present in a certain situation.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
New layer and let's start with some of the darker purple clouds.	O
So I'm actually going to color pic from the rocks just as like a starting point.	O
And I think it needs to be more purple, I think maybe the.	O
More more saturation.	O
And when I paint clouds.	O
I often like to paint circular shapes with my brush because I find that that's often just more reminiscent of how they how they move and they kind of expand out and balloon out so.	O
It works pretty well to just make little circular.	O
You can make them more round or more flat, but make these kind of strokes.	O
Oh, thank you Axel, I really appreciate that.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
So the Camera view is.	CHITCHAT
Often these virtual Plein Air paintings, they kind of have this fish.	CHITCHAT
I look because the A lot of times the Camera lens just that's what it's doing so.	CHITCHAT
I kind of I don't mind it.	CHITCHAT
I kind of like it.	CHITCHAT
Actually, I think it's cool.	CHITCHAT
It's a little bit cinematic, sometimes so.	CHITCHAT
I'm just you can see how the the angle of the clouds is shifting from over here.	CHITCHAT
And then kind of flaring towards us and then out over into this direction.	CHITCHAT
Sorry.	CHITCHAT
No, it's it's OK.	CHITCHAT
Jake Parker said that the October.	CHITCHAT
Police are are fired their disbanded.	CHITCHAT

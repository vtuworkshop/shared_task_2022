Cool, thank you very cinematic already that makes me happy.	CHITCHAT
Good to hear.	CHITCHAT
This the scene when I first saw the references just reminded me of like the opening opening shot to a movie or something some kind of epic setting.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, don't worry.	CHITCHAT
I love it.	CHITCHAT
He made an announcement about that.	CHITCHAT
Since I think you got a little out of hand with people being too worried about following rules and kind of policing each other and so I like that, he made an announcement about it and.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully, that will have a more positive effects on how the community.	CHITCHAT
Axe surrounding October.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I'm just using this much brush to get rid of a couple edges here and there.	O
And can merge this down, I might get to the point of merging this to the Sky soon.	O
I think I think it might actually be nicer.	O
'Cause then when I use the smudge brush.	O
I'm just going to do it, then why is this much brush it's going to just much all the layers?	O
We can get some more.	O
Interesting effects.	O
Wanna dark in this?	O
A little bit more here.	O
OK, so you later and we can keep going the clouds are a multiple stage process.	O
Not able to get everything at once.	O
So it's going to be, it's going to take a little bit.	O
Me too.	O
I love this much brush.	CHITCHAT
These are all the time.	O
And mostly is it just too soft and hard edges.	O
When I use either hard brushes or the lasso tool airbrush combo.	O
I don't necessarily like paint with this much brush.	O
I know some people involve it in their process in a different way.	O
I'm always open to that, but I usually just use it for the edge control.	O
By Tara thanks for sharing your inktober piece.	CHITCHAT
See you later.	CHITCHAT
So right now, it's going to get a little bit.	O
Messier before it gets better, but what I'm doing is painting in a bunch of the shadows that are blocking the light and after this we're going to do one more layer where we're going to go to the highlight layer next and then we'll have some more sharpness to the edges and stuff is will be able to bring that right hard light coming through so right now, I might be painting in more shadows.	O
Then I need and I'm just kind of going for it 'cause.	O
This is going to get partially covered in the next.	O
Please.	CHITCHAT
But there's just so many.	CHITCHAT
So many levels and layers and details.	O
I feel like you could take it this as far as you wanted to.	CHITCHAT
With like how much time you want to spend and how much detail.	CHITCHAT
You want to get into.	CHITCHAT
I do want to make this area.	O
A little bit more intense.	O
This is a really cool spot in the cloud and it's important compositionally.	O
I think that there's like some weight to a couple of these spots so I need to darken them up.	O
So one thing that helps is if you're a painting from reference and you do want to resemble the reference.	O
I mean, I haven't been so strict with it, but looking making this smaller you can really see the difference is so.	O
Again, I'm just kind of taking the shapes that I like from the reference and doing my own thing with the scene.	CHITCHAT
But if you're doing a study that you want to really be.	CHITCHAT
On with the reference that's something that can help checking your processes like to view it really, really zoomed out.	CHITCHAT
Right so I'm going to smudge a couple things in and then we're going to go to highlights.	O
OK, new layer.	O

And.	CHITCHAT
Big.	O
Hard brush I think.	O
Maybe this one.	O
All right and so now we can make this edge more defined.	O
We can paint over.	O
The edges of the cloud.	O
With that bright light and so we're kind of painting in the silver lining sort of effect and in between here and anywhere, we want.	O
You know you can look at the reference to see where it makes sense.	O
Where to go?	CHITCHAT
And there's more colors, you know, we can paint also a warmer color going around more pink.	O
Gotta go next to be here if you guys.	CHITCHAT
See you marry by Huxel.	CHITCHAT
Thanks for hanging out have a good day.	CHITCHAT
Do you stick to one brush for most of the painting and changed more appropriate brushes later or try to choose the right brush based on the objects.	O
That's a good question.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it just depends on my mood that day for example.	O
There are times where I use like only one or 2 brushes for the whole painting and I honestly don't know why that is.	O
It just kind of get into groove with those brushes and they seem to be doing the job but.	O
Usually I kind of stick to some more basic brushes at the beginning.	O
When I'm blocking things in and then when I start to get further along in the process and start painting more specific individual textures for different things.	O
Then I'll I'll start getting into more like specialized brushes sometimes.	O
Yeah, that's it's it depends so much on the look.	CHITCHAT
I want for the scene like it's nice to be consistent with your brushes like if you have a few brushes that you use?	O
For a for a scene then you're going to end up with more consistent look.	O
This is just a generalization you know, people can make all kinds of stuff actually work for them, but you know the generally the more brushes.	O
You try to use in one scene and have it look like it's a consistent style.	O
It can be more more challenging to like bring everything together with those all these different textures of the brushes have and then it starts to look.	O
You know a little crazy, so I try not to use a ton of different brushes.	O
Sometimes I have brushes that only have a very slightly different texture than another one, they look really cohesive together at least I hope so.	O
But it's so nice if you.	CHITCHAT
Are able to like overtime?	CHITCHAT
You just get familiar with your brush set and then?	CHITCHAT
When you see a certain texture.	CHITCHAT
You start to think right away like what you can choose that will help you achieve that texture more quickly.	CHITCHAT
And I do a lot of the time to paint things so that's really great for me.	CHITCHAT
I think if you are just rendering everything out.	O
You can just pick with the hard round brush all the time if you want you know.	O
I like to.	CHITCHAT
You some texture brushes and some brushes that simulate more traditional painting an?	O
Those kind of things.	O
But it's so much personal preference.	O
So the highlights bringing in the warm glow and I'm starting to like this scene better.	O
Emerge that down, make a new layer and it's surprising sometimes what kind of brushes.	O
You can use in different places like for example, let's try.	O
This one.	O
Shadi brushes when I usually use for rock painting, but you can use it in the Sky 2.	O
Like clouds, sometimes have.	O
You know textures weather like dissolving and stuff, I think it's important just to be consistent throughout the painting.	O
There's a fresh that might be good for this also I recently added a few brushes to my brush set so I'm still like trying them out and enjoying them and seeing if they're going to be permanent in my rotation.	O
But I do like this very, very, very tiny spot of light down here.	O
It's like a couple areas that are breaking through.	O
The clouds and we get like the bright bright glow.	O
Like the color variety, you have in the Sky.	O

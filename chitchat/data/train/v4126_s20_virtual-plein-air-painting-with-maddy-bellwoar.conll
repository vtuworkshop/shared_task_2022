Thank you Mills.	CHITCHAT
Feels like early morning.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
I wonder what time of day, it really is.	CHITCHAT
I have a hard time sometimes when I look at photos.	CHITCHAT
Detecting if it's the sunset or sunrise.	CHITCHAT
But I'm happy if it has like a peaceful feeling.	CHITCHAT
And add some more less saturated Grays into the clouds as I'm going really like fantasy with all these Purples, which is possible sunsets and sunrises have crazy colors, so it's all possible.	CHITCHAT
So I think I need to add some more blue very, very light blue coming through here right in the middle.	O
Looking at this now, one thing that I think a mistake that I made is I kind of.	O
Put like even space in between things a little bit so for example, I can fix it now.	O
What I'm going to do is make a selection of the mountain here?	O
They only want to really mess with the clouds.	O
So it's going to be convenient.	O
If I copy.	O
This on to another layer.	O
So just layer new layer via copy or control J and now I can do stuff with the Sky usually.	O
But I think I'm going to.	O
Just copy this little section of Sky.	O
So this little area right here.	O
And then Squish it down.	O
Because it's a little bit more narrow in the.	O
In the reference so it's a bit messy after paint over some stuff but the idea is.	O
It's going to leave a larger opening in the clouds in the center.	O
I think that might be nice.	O
What I had?	CHITCHAT
I felt a little bit, too, like the size of a cloud was the same as the size.	O
The opening and then we go to the next layer of clouds.	O
Too matchy matchy.	O
Yeah, so I'm going to merge that down.	O
Then I can smudge brush out some of these places where you see the?	O
The line there.	O
And again merge the?	O
Background together again, and it's like it never happened.	O
I also I really love using layer blending modes like overlay and color Dodge for painting clouds.	O
We haven't done it yet, but you know it's going to happen before the end.	CHITCHAT
We're going to add some color Dodge to be careful.	O
We don't over expose it too much.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
That's the kind of situation that you get with these.	O
Sometimes, like in real life.	O
When you're looking at the Sky.	O
Sometimes it really does have that effect is just so, so bright so it could be fun to add a little bit.	O
Alright so I'm gonna grab a soft.	O
Brush and just add some of these little individual Tufts.	O
I also have some brushes they often like to use for clouds.	O
One of them is called pastel soft fluffy.	O
Anything called soft fluffy is probably good for clouds.	O
And it has a little bit of texture at the end.	O
Just nice 'cause clouds have a little bit of texture.	O
Going to pop a little bit more highlights in the edges.	O

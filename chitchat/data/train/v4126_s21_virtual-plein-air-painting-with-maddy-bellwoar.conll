Little silver lining and then we're going to go to the next stage almost passed.	O
Almost ready to move on.	O
The next thing.	O
And the the water reflection, it's gonna be so good.	O
I think that's what made me want to paint this scene anyway.	CHITCHAT
So looking forward to doing that part.	CHITCHAT
I like the little bit of a squirrel thing that's happening here.	CHITCHAT
Being color pick the Sky paint back over Top.	O
Just trying to bring in some shapes to the edges, a little bit, but I feel like I ended up with a lot of very, very soft edge?	O
Is there are some hard edges.	O
Cloud.	O
Scenario.	CHITCHAT
But I think clouds cloud painting just takes a little bit of time.	CHITCHAT
If it's a crazy set skyscape.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to take much time we have left we were doing pretty good.	CHITCHAT
We have, like an hour and 15 minutes or so left of stream so I think we'll be able to.	CHITCHAT
Get something nice way to end here.	CHITCHAT
Thanks Mills I was just thinking that.	CHITCHAT
I think it's going to happen.	CHITCHAT
OK, so merge that down.	O
Look my canvas slip the.	O
Reference.	O
So here's what I was talking about.	CHITCHAT
After doing some painting, I think it's time now to come in and.	O
And we can one little brush stroke here, but we're going to do.	O
New layer going to put it on multiply, I think.	O
Want to add some shadows around the outside to make this a little bit more Moody Maybe.	O
It's a little bit darker.	O
Looking like little thing it around the Sky.	O
Not everywhere just the Sky.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Then I'm going to make a new layer and put it on, Black paint bucket on the layer put that on color Dodge.	O
And I'm going to pick a warm color warm light color and just test it out.	O
OK so that's really bright of course.	O
But I think it's perfect.	O
So I'm just going to use the Airbrush and.	O
Lightly tap in this really bright colour.	O
Maybe all lower.	O
The Opacity, a little bit.	O
I don't over expose it like crazy, but I do like that glow.	O
Specially right on the edges of the.	O
The clouds.	O
All thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you like it thanks thanks and tell her.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Alright I'm going to go back to the.	O
Textured brush the soft and fluffy brush.	O
And just actually paint on this color, Dodge mode, so it's going to give a little bit more of like almost electric effect.	O
Where the brush strokes are?	O
Maybe I will make it a little bit warmer.	O
So we're going to get some very, very intense.	O
Lines of color.	O
Oh, you're fine gnutella.	CHITCHAT
Hope I hope you're doing good.	CHITCHAT
This weekend went really fast.	CHITCHAT

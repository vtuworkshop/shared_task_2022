I'll thank you.	CHITCHAT
Angelica thank you welcome.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for the nice comments.	CHITCHAT
We're doing a little virtual clean air.	CHITCHAT
If anyone's just coming in and you want to see the reference you can check the information or.	CHITCHAT
Below the stream.	CHITCHAT
There's a link I'm changing things a little bit from the reference and there's a lot, that's the same.	CHITCHAT
But changing a couple things to my liking.	CHITCHAT
Having fun with it.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I like that little.	O
Extra light.	O
I gotta be careful that we don't overdo it, too much in areas away from the focal point.	O
But a little bit is good specially if it's kind of showing that.	O
Rays of light effect.	O
Which we get back here actually get like the Rays coming down?	O
So I'm going to do on a separate layer.	O
Do the same thing.	O
But I think it's gonna work better coming from.	O
The airbrush like lasso tool airbrush sort of thing, so I'm just going to select the area that I want light Rays to be coming down.	O
And then Make a little stencil.	O
And then we'll do that so.	O
Got the airbrush.	O
Super 8.	O
Try this.	O
Like maybe we can even add more than what there is.	O
I want to try the flat brush.	O
At such a fun effect, Oh my gosh, it never gets old.	CHITCHAT
Some people might disagree about that, but I think it doesn't.	CHITCHAT
I think not.	CHITCHAT
But it's really important to get the angle.	O
All coming from the same place.	O
Really sells it better.	O
We try flipping.	O
And I think you want to have a different size to the light Rays.	O
Like we don't want the same thickness.	O
Everywhere then it doesn't feel.	O
Very believable.	O
Nice light Rays thanks.	CHITCHAT
There's so much fun.	CHITCHAT
We can have some labor is coming out the other side, too.	CHITCHAT
Hey buddy, it's reaching Raccoon, a welcome baptised welcome welcome thanks for coming over.	CHITCHAT
Hope you having a good day.	CHITCHAT
Right so I think I like it.	CHITCHAT
And I can go Walmart that stuff down.	CHITCHAT
So now we have.	O
This background layer.	O
This in the foreground.	O
The sketch layer still needs a lot of work.	O
I'm going to make a new layer an created clipping mask onto the rock layer and use the Airbrush.	O
I'm going to put the layer on multiply and just use the airbrush to give some soft shading.	O
I'm picking a dark blue color for this and I hope that it will make the rocks look more fit into the environment.	O
There's right now they almost seem like they're painted in a different style and kind of like pasted on Top of everything so I've used a lot of soft brushes in the other aspects of this painting an I use mostly hard brushes on the rocks.	O
So I'm just going to use that soft airbrush shade, a little bit on the rocks here and try to make them look like they belong with the rest of this so I think that helps a little bit.	O
We could do the same thing with the highlights.	O
Can try overlay and I can apply some bright highlights to the rocks?	O
And also use the airbrush for that, so I'm going to first start with a scion colored.	O
Airbrush just to add a little bit of bounce light.	O
Like that.	CHITCHAT
Have to do watercolor painting of a landscape with only one color for my school.	CHITCHAT
That's a cool challenge.	CHITCHAT
Do you know what color that you're going to pick do you get to pick or was the colour also assigned to you right good luck.	CHITCHAT
I hope it goes well.	CHITCHAT
That is definitely a challenge.	CHITCHAT

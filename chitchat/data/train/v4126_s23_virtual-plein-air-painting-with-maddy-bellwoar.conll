Emerge that down.	O
Maybe I should also do color Dodge on the rocks now getting color Dodge Happy But.	O
It's fun.	CHITCHAT
Tricolor Dodge just try it.	O
It's a little bit of a little bit of a glow.	O
Never heard anybody.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think it's cool.	CHITCHAT
I get to pick but I still don't know what I'm going to use.	O
Yeah, that's tough to decide.	O
In my head when when I was just reading what you said about the challenge for some reason I imagined like blue like an ultramarine blue or something.	CHITCHAT
I would suggest.	CHITCHAT
Picking a color that has the potential to get pretty dark in its darker state, but that's that's just it's all it's all up to you.	CHITCHAT
It's your project, but I think for example, painting with like yellow or something really light that doesn't have the can't achieve like dark value that would be really hard to do.	CHITCHAT
So I don't know maybe that helps.	CHITCHAT
Hey George, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
I am working from.	CHITCHAT
Reference that say, I found it through map crunch.com and it's from.	CHITCHAT
Actually, Google Street View Crazy awesome stuff on there for practicing.	CHITCHAT
Painting landscapes and things.	CHITCHAT
You guys, I think I'm actually gonna go zoom in and blur out some of these.	O
Some of these details that I sketched him on the rock.	O
I'm still think it's just too.	O
Sharp compared to the rest of the painting is just bothering me how sharpies edges are so I'm using this much brush and I'm just going to.	O
Blend some of them out where I don't think there need needed that there so sharp.	O
And then will just paint on Top of it.	O
If you have any questions or anything.	CHITCHAT
Let me know.	CHITCHAT
And if you like the reference and you want to give it a shot you're welcome to paint with me.	CHITCHAT
Right it's a little better.	CHITCHAT
And I would choose purple if ever do it, yeah, the one color painting.	O
Yeah, purple forget color.	O
I think maybe I would choose maybe blue or green.	O
Blue greens and Purples all my favorite colors?	O
Can you see why, why this reference appealed to me.	CHITCHAT
It has all the things that I really like.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to bring a little bit more rim lighting up here.	O
Highlights facing towards the light source.	O
One thing I want to do that.	O
We haven't got a chance to do yet is I want to bring in.	O
A lot more.	O
Little Bush is and little things that will make a blend between the Rock and the environment is right now, it's just like the rocks and then smooth grass.	O
So I'd really like to add some little little plants and grasses and things to make a smoother transition.	O
Yeah, people can get really dark substitutes Blackwell, but that depends on how your colors are yeah, exactly I like to use purple for that.	O
I think that's the case in this painting, too well.	O
I guess you could say this is kind of dark blue but it certainly looks purple.	O
Alright so.	CHITCHAT
Let's see going to make a new layer underneath of the layer with the rocks and.	O
Let's get some dark green here.	O
This is what kind of what I was just talking about.	O
I feel like there's this disconnect between the rocks in the environment 'cause I just.	O
They're kind of the same kind of pasted on.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Part of it has to do with the value like they really are sitting right on Top of it, they would have a shadow behind them.	O
Since the light is so intense.	O
You know this would all be.	O
Something something like that would maybe be a little bit better, and Little Tufts of grass and stuff, they would all create little shadows and things.	O
So let's flip.	O

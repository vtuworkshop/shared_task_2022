Yeah, that looks a lot better.	CHITCHAT
Get God Rays, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Mrs with the rivers and back be similar color to the God Rays.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, yeah, they would I would actually when I get to those.	CHITCHAT
I would actually kind of base it off of exactly what they are reflecting so for example, I would probably pick like the really bright color in the Sky to use for the area right below it.	O
Saying it could be really, really bright, but what I would do is do the whole shape 1st and then apply a gradient to it.	O
I'll be getting to that soon so let me just finish what I'm doing the foreground and then I'll show you like exactly how I think.	O
It would be the easiest way to your paint those.	O
Little River things 'cause I think that we can get.	O
Use a method that will make it not too.	O
Not too crazy to do.	CHITCHAT
Not too labor intensive.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
I wanted to try this brush for some of the grass is an I don't think that's going to work.	O
Sometimes rake brushes and things are fun to use for this kind of.	O
Situation because it looks you know it has that look of like traditional painting.	O
But it's And it can it does the job of making it look like there's there's grass is here, but it looks as if it's done in one brush stroke kind of thing.	O
These can be cool but.	O
I don't know if it's exactly.	CHITCHAT
I want.	CHITCHAT
Somewhere, along the way I found a brush that I liked and lost it.	O
I did.	CHITCHAT
It was a rake brush then go back through some my old brush sets and see if I can find it again.	O
Yeah, I just want to give a little texture.	O
I don't know if that's too much.	CHITCHAT
We don't have all day so I can't.	CHITCHAT
Start going in crazy detail.	CHITCHAT
Alright I will work on the rivers now and then we'll come back to the foreground.	O
But I think it's at least better than it was before.	O
So on a new layer.	O
Between the background and the rocks.	O
I'm going to take the flat brush.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Just pick a very bright color just so I can see it very easily against the background.	O
And I'm going to only worry about the.	CHITCHAT
Shape of these rivers.	CHITCHAT
I'm not going to worry about the colour because this is too bright for most of the area, but I'm not concerned.	O
With that right now.	O
I want to only think about what shape the rivers are so I'm looking at the reference.	O
Going off of that.	O
And.	O
I think this flat brush works really well because it makes a very thin.	O
Stroke that looks kind of similar to the way these are these rivers are like flattened out.	O
Because of our view.	O
And there's little rivers back here.	O
You can zoom in on the reference and get a closer look.	O
I honestly I'm not zooming in.	CHITCHAT
Right now 'cause I.	CHITCHAT
It can be nice also to not zoom in.	CHITCHAT
Because then you kind of focus on the big picture, so I'm just looking at the most prominent.	O
Areas of water and.	O
I like that there's this one area that it kind of splits off into multiple.	O
Also, you don't have to put them exactly where they are in the reference.	O
We can do our own thing a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I was thinking earlier, about making totally like fantasy shapes and swirls and the with the water.	CHITCHAT
No.	CHITCHAT
There's another.	CHITCHAT
There's actually a few areas back here.	O
Locate a control Z.	O
Take me awhile to get there right.	O

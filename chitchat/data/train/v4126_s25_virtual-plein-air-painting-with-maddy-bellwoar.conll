Angle.	O
And also erase out.	O
Cut back into the paint stroke to get a different thickness.	O
More natural look.	O
And then this one comes like this.	O
Well, that would be softer curve.	O
Let's try that again.	O
I do think it's pretty if you change the thickness here and there like the width of the line for something like this.	O
Maybe these can match up, I don't know that doesn't seem seem right.	O
This ones.	O
Make that more grounded.	O
Almost done.	O
The stage.	O
It's so easy to make them to make them not flat enough.	O
It doesn't.	CHITCHAT
I don't know why but it's so easy to do so.	O
Over here, we can like.	O
Squish them a little bit.	O
Just reads better it's I don't know why it is that even though I.	O
I know I'm looking at this and like I know I need to make it really fly still painted too much like you're getting an aerial view.	O
You know you really wanna.	CHITCHAT
Because I could have done that all together.	O
This whole area could use that so let's just do like this.	O
Just let it.	O
Lisa is getting a head start on October 1st one is done.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
View the movie The ring.	CHITCHAT
I actually never saw this like one of the one of the only people but.	CHITCHAT
You got that you definitely got a nice creepy result here anatomy on the hand and this arm for shortenings all really cool.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm not like super big in through scary movies.	CHITCHAT
Do you like a good zombie movie?	CHITCHAT
But.	CHITCHAT
Right so a little bit.	CHITCHAT
You can also erase out a little bit here and there, because there could be trees or other things, blocking your view of the water and that kind of seems believable if you have like these little.	CHITCHAT
Little breaks in it here in there, so you can just kind of scribble with your eraser.	CHITCHAT
Reset a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Really was Alright Oh man.	CHITCHAT
You guys are brief.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I duplicate the layer and flattened it down just 'cause I wanted to make sure that my drawing had 100% opacity to it.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to pop in its couple tiny couple extra little water spots.	O
I want to overdo it might be overdoing it.	O
OK, so.	O
Now let's.	O
Do the next step.	O
Which is going to be locking the transparency so lock that affair now anything that we paint within the layer of the.	O
Water is only going to affect that shape so we can make this whatever color we want.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
So now I would like to take the airbrush color pic from the Sky and the Sky is what's being reflected in the water.	O
So basically as you go through you can kind of color.	O
Pic from the Sky and bring those colors down into the water and that's going to make a little bit more of a realistic reflection and then you can really bump up the the light in a couple of spots like so for example.	O
Over here, we're getting a nice glow.	O
From some of the Rays coming over and hitting this spot.	O
Like you can just look at the reference for some pants on where to put the shiny stuff.	O
I think I missed.	CHITCHAT

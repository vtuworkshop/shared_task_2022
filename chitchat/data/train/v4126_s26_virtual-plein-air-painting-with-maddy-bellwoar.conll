Cool spot.	CHITCHAT
Like 1, Baker area in the water that I missed here.	O
Get that in.	O
Maybe it maybe not.	CHITCHAT
Maybe it's better without it.	O
OK.	O
So I think I'm going to merge that down and then do like some extra color Dodge stuff to it.	O
Maybe it's eonism.	CHITCHAT
Soon, as I'm happy with what we have here.	CHITCHAT
Right so I'm gonna try emerging this down.	O
And then Make a new layer.	O
With that I'm color Dodge or maybe even overlay.	O
The Airbrush.	O
Let's do the same thing with black paint bucket on the layer and now we can play with these kind of highlights.	O
Like a warm light here.	O
So I'm going to get a new layer put an overlaying try that I want to bring in the little bit of warm color here so.	O
I'm going to find the right Hue.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Messing around until I find something I like.	CHITCHAT
Fairly tricky one.	CHITCHAT
Maybe screen or soft light would also be good.	O
Sometimes you just gotta play with the layer modes until you find 1.	O
There we go screen.	O
I think I like screen mode.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
But some warm glow.	O
Just a little bit of like a?	O
A hazy.	O
Atmosphere.	O
And it brings the colors from the clouds down.	O
Now we can go to overlay maybe.	O
For some surrounding area.	O
Murder Pasetti 'cause that was a bit too much darkening.	O
And now we can try again with color Dodge 'cause I really want to color Dodge just like some small areas.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
For example, Just like really, really school, but I'm going to do is make a selection because I think I want a glow effect.	O
But I feel like I only want it.	O
I kind of want it above the water.	O
Can't decide what I want.	CHITCHAT
Little specks over there on the left is that hobbits is on a journey.	CHITCHAT
It could be.	CHITCHAT
Unfortunately, they didn't get to spend too much time in like.	CHITCHAT
I guess they had a riven, though thinking back.	CHITCHAT
It's like they had to go through a lot of brutal places so we've been a good one good one for them.	CHITCHAT
On a Field Trip Hobbits is on a field trip.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we could be aglow.	CHITCHAT
It's so fun.	CHITCHAT
It's so fun.	CHITCHAT
This is the part we've been waiting for.	CHITCHAT
I am going to over do it.	CHITCHAT
Not trying to but I can see.	CHITCHAT
So we got to stay zoomed out and take a look at it from this.	O
Preview.	O
So I don't go too far, yeah.	CHITCHAT
Like glow you can also use a normal mode to do a nice glow effect.	O
But there's a glow all the way out here.	O
Thanks we My goal is your setup are you on a tablet.	CHITCHAT
I am using a welcome centriq that 22 HD and.	CHITCHAT

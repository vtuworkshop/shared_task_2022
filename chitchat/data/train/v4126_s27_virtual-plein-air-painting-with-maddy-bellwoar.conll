My PC so I'm not on a tablet like A.	CHITCHAT
You have a drawing tablet screen tablet, but it's not like.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's a PC.	CHITCHAT
Hi friends, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you with colors make me really happy.	CHITCHAT
Alright I'm going to merge everything down now with the background.	O
And let's see how it's going with the the rocks do you guys remember when I was going to add like a flag and stuff?	O
I don't really think it needs it now like I think it I think it was.	O
I think I'm I'm liking how it's going so far, it will see maybe we will add one but.	O
Make a new layer go to.	O
Flat brush and I just want to keep going.	O
With this reflected light on the rocks.	O
I feel like I must have made the rocks way too dark to start with 'cause I've been ever.	O
Since then, the whole painting process.	O
I've just been like trying to lighten these rocks.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Let's keep going.	CHITCHAT
Really epic landscape, thank you.	CHITCHAT
It is so beautiful.	CHITCHAT
Doing these virtual Plein Air paintings is giving me a really different perspective on like.	CHITCHAT
World geography, I've learned about a lot of different places and.	CHITCHAT
Sort of I don't know discovered more beautiful places that I never really thought about before.	CHITCHAT
This this landscape for example, is in Mongolia.	CHITCHAT
So gorgeous.	CHITCHAT
Bring a little bit of that blue bounce light.	CHITCHAT
But trying to keep the layers with that whole feeling of the rows of the Rock 'cause.	CHITCHAT
It's Seems to be breaking off cool angles.	CHITCHAT
It's really, really pretty.	CHITCHAT
So there's no reference for this rock on the rights.	O
I'm just kind of following what I did on the left from the photo and trying to come up with our own rock shapes that still feel like they fit together.	O
And we're going to add in some more plants and stuff now.	O
'Cause I think it would be the case.	O
That we have.	O
Some.	CHITCHAT
Leaves and plants growing up in front of rocks and stuff.	O
Let's see how to handle that our random brush stroke in the Sky that was an accident.	O
Alright so emerge that down.	O
But I do like the blue coming in closer to us.	O
I think that's important.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to add a little bit more of that now that I'm noticing it's definitely helping.	O
The Blue Sky showing up on these rocks.	O
Oh, sorry guys there's Neighbors dogs being loud.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Here.	CHITCHAT
Also, there's trees.	CHITCHAT
There's trees, let's see if we can put some of those in so down on the.	O
Mountain side.	O
Facing downward there's trees and I'm looking to see if I have a?	O
A brush that gives a very.	O
Textured look.	O
Because it be nice if I could just kind of indicate these trees with a few brushstrokes so I have to keep it very.	O
Keep a very loose and focus on the shape of the full.	O
Tree and not worry too much about details.	O
They'll go in the background.	O
Thanks Mills.	CHITCHAT

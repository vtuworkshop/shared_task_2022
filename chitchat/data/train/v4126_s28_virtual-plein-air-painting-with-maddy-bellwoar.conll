It might work going to lock the layer and.	O
But some warm color to the trees.	O
The idea is that some of them are closer to us some of them are further away.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to start with some relatively lighter valued trees, so like not as dark shading and then we'll add some that are closer to us that are going to get darker and start feeling closer and closer to foreground.	O
And there's just random little.	O
Little.	CHITCHAT
Thoughts down here they're all like little bushes and trees and stuff.	O
All the way into the background here can sneak some of those they gotta be careful.	O
We will go to dark near the glow or it's going to stand out.	O
Not in good way.	O
Little tree lines kind of lost some of the tree lines over here.	O
I hope you guys are having a good day, thanks for hanging out here.	CHITCHAT
Everything's going well, whatever you're working on.	CHITCHAT
Mills I think that purple shadows just make everything look magical that's what I've learned recently.	CHITCHAT
Add Purple Shadows Magical.	CHITCHAT
Right I was supposed to be painting trees.	CHITCHAT
I don't know what happened.	CHITCHAT
I really carried away.	CHITCHAT
Let's go down here.	O
More trees, you actually see like an intense shadow.	O
There's some big trees, down here.	O
I guess and you can see cash shadow behind them so.	O
I'll do that, too.	O
Is a Google Maps Street View yes exactly exactly?	CHITCHAT
You can.	CHITCHAT
See the location if you want below the.	CHITCHAT
Load the stream there's a link if you want to open up the 360 view.	CHITCHAT
It's it was bound through map crunch.	CHITCHAT
Which is a website that takes the Google Street View images and kind of?	CHITCHAT
Arranges them in a way where you can get random images.	CHITCHAT
You can sort through random images.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty addicting actually I love looking for stuff there and it's.	CHITCHAT
Sucks you in like I under spending a bit of time.	CHITCHAT
Just clicking through and finding cool spots.	CHITCHAT
It's like a little bit of its own hobby now.	CHITCHAT
I really like to just look through there and find stuff to Paden.	CHITCHAT
Just.	CHITCHAT
Expand your visual libraries, see new things.	CHITCHAT
In the discord there's a there's a discord channel in my server where.	CHITCHAT
Me and other people in the community to like to search for these we post the link that good places.	CHITCHAT
Good fines for painting so if you ever want to save yourself.	CHITCHAT
The time of doing all the searching you can check out that Channel, 'cause there's a lot of good ones in there.	CHITCHAT
Never find good spots when using map crunch really yeah.	CHITCHAT
There's there's certain ways that I've kind of.	CHITCHAT
Sounds too.	CHITCHAT
Find better places like I do end up zooming in a lot sometimes on the map in.	CHITCHAT
Just going to places that I suspect you're going to have nice spots like looking for.	CHITCHAT
Places near water rivers, coastal stuff.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, sometimes if I go if I go the totally random approach.	CHITCHAT
I don't get the best ones.	CHITCHAT
But sometimes I've gotten some good ones.	CHITCHAT
I do think I've gotten some good look on there will say that.	CHITCHAT
There's also the sheer amount of time spent.	CHITCHAT
Oh boy that's a lot.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Work on the foreground textures, a little bit.	O
I think it's still pretty rough.	O

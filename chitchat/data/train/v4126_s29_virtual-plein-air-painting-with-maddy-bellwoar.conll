And we have about 30 minutes left.	CHITCHAT
That was fast.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Definitely wanna.	CHITCHAT
Use the 30 minutes to the best.	CHITCHAT
Can.	CHITCHAT
I think I think those sites are better for urban sketching.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, definitely there's a lot of you can find a lot of.' City and neighborhood stuff there, too.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, Robert.	CHITCHAT
I was hoping.	CHITCHAT
I would like to go here.	CHITCHAT
Wonder there's ever been like a movie filmed here or something.	CHITCHAT
Looks like a good place.	CHITCHAT
Or something like that.	CHITCHAT
Alright so now let's try layer two of trees.	O
So we'll pick tool.	O
Neither the brush and I want to pick a dark green that's going to appear to be closer to us.	O
And then you put some.	O
Trees.	O
Add a little bit larger.	O
Not super happy with that let's try.	O
You shifting it's a little warmer.	O
Darker.	O
Remind me of King Arthur with Clive Owen.	CHITCHAT
That's cool Jeremy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's like that's really the vive it's like something.	CHITCHAT
Very very epic and could be timeless like I could see something like that.	CHITCHAT
I could also see something almost like prehistoric like I can see like a Dinosaur walking through this place or something like it's really interesting very interesting place.	CHITCHAT
So another tree over here.	O
Little bit darker.	O
Well, I'm not super happy with how the trees look but.	O
I also feel like I need to keep going and just work on integrating this whole area in the foreground and maybe I will be happier with it after that.	O
Because there's a lot of things in this area that are just not driving yet so.	O
I'll do some more work and then we'll see.	O
See trying to teach a student how to do is 2D art better.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes he rushes his work or makes it too dark.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think those are definitely very like normal, especially early on.	CHITCHAT
Things.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, that stuff.	CHITCHAT
Like I use timers to help me not spend too much time on something but maybe he could use a timer for like the opposite thing and spend more time.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if that, really works that way or not, that would help.	CHITCHAT
Missouri first day of inktober let's see.	CHITCHAT
Oh, you guys are definitely going there.	CHITCHAT
These are definitely getting in like the Halloween vives, but there's a lot of like overlap with that.	CHITCHAT
This is Missouri's ring inspired into rupees.	CHITCHAT
I feel like in October.	CHITCHAT
It doesn't necessarily have to be spooky or Halloween.	CHITCHAT
But there's a bit of a mood overlap with that there's a lot of a lot of the prompt words, I think could be taken in a spooky way.	CHITCHAT
And there's a lot of Inktober lists are Halloween themed is just something about the medium, too, like I love Inc.	CHITCHAT
But it's so.	CHITCHAT
It just is intrinsically dark and so it kind of can lend itself to some more spooky look.	CHITCHAT
I think the the medium that you use?	CHITCHAT
Really influences your will of course, influences your art, but but beyond that.	CHITCHAT

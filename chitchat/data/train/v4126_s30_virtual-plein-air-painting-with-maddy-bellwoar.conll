I can't influence your subject matter to like.	CHITCHAT
I really think that when I when I was doing ink work in the past.	CHITCHAT
I did a lot of like darker subject matter.	CHITCHAT
And I don't know it just it would just happen.	CHITCHAT
Oh, thank you gnutella.	CHITCHAT
Thank you that makes me really happy have a good rest of the day.	CHITCHAT
And see you later.	CHITCHAT
Skin itching now the first prompt and it's so much fun nice power Hornet.	CHITCHAT
I'm looking forward to Thursday, this week.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to be doing some.	CHITCHAT
Traditional art.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry that was really loud.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
I had a timer on from something that I had to put a timer on yesterday.	CHITCHAT
An I forgot.	CHITCHAT
It was still on so I hope you're all well.	CHITCHAT
You're probably a week.	CHITCHAT
Now I don't know how well my microphone picked it up, but knowing my microphone.	CHITCHAT
Y'all got a really loud alarm there so I'm sorry.	CHITCHAT
Oh Alright Skip back in the painting.	O
Going to make a new layer above the layer of the.	O
Rocks and I want to start overlapping some greenery and and Bush is and things.	O
So it's not just yeah 'cause.	CHITCHAT
It says it feels a little bit fake to me that there's there's this layering and there's nothing coming back on Top so.	O
Let's put a Bush here or or just have a little bit of grass is coming up.	O
I'm just trying to figure out.	O
The texture that I want for that.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I'm going to look at the windows ink thing.	CHITCHAT
After this stream.	CHITCHAT
There's some weird stuff going on still.	CHITCHAT
Maybe we can get rid of that.	CHITCHAT
Where did my brush pen capsules time to try this inktober bays?	CHITCHAT
Enjoy enjoy.	CHITCHAT
It's been too long for me.	CHITCHAT
Too long since I've done ink stuff, so really enjoying it used to be my main medium before I got into digital.	CHITCHAT
Digital art.	CHITCHAT
Things to do only pen and ink stuff all pending all the time.	CHITCHAT
So I'm just going to do some individual little.	O
Grass is Um.	O
I have a 22 inch centriq, but Michaels asking would you suggest the 16 for starters ever we come into us with pen kinda hard to draw we're not looking?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, in your case it sounds like that would be a really good option for you, I.	CHITCHAT
I personally love working on this antique.	CHITCHAT
We talked about this we talk about this a lot in various streams.	CHITCHAT
It's It's it's one of those things where you certainly don't need a centriq into us is great and a lot of people are doing awesome work on it.	CHITCHAT
A lot of professionals use it.	CHITCHAT
But I had the same kind of experience I found it really tough to.	CHITCHAT
Paint and look in a different area and for me, transitioning from traditional it was a lot more.	CHITCHAT
Natural for me too.	CHITCHAT
To be able to draw and look at the same place you know to draw on the screen.	CHITCHAT
So if you're feeling that way.	CHITCHAT
I think it would be good option.	CHITCHAT
I think so.	CHITCHAT
I haven't tried or seen in person.	CHITCHAT
The 16 inch centriq, but I can say that I'm really happy with 22.	CHITCHAT
I have seen the 13 and tried it and that one was a little bit smaller than I would prefer for painting so I think that the difference between the 13 and 16 could be really.	CHITCHAT
I think that that would be a pretty big difference and I think I think you probably be happy with it.	CHITCHAT
Robert says I'm running through the fields in your pig.	CHITCHAT
Add thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you guys, it's almost done.	CHITCHAT
Just trying to get this last little.	CHITCHAT
Bit feeling more cookie so here.	CHITCHAT
In the foreground.	CHITCHAT
By mizore see you tomorrow have a good evening.	CHITCHAT

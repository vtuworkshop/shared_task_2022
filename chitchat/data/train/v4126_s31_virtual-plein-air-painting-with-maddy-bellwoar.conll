Yeah, whatever you're thinking about for your tablet.	CHITCHAT
You know watch a lot of videos.	CHITCHAT
I'm not sure if other brands have this sort of thing, but I know welcome has a	CHITCHAT
Like an experience center that you might be able to go to depending on where you live so before I bought my tablet.	CHITCHAT
I went in person an tried it and.	CHITCHAT
I had to drive pretty far to do that, but it would think it's worth it.	CHITCHAT
If you can so it was like.	CHITCHAT
An hour or so away.	CHITCHAT
So there might be 1 year you there may not be and so in that case.	CHITCHAT
Then you kinda just have to look at online tutorial not tutorials, but reviews and stuff.	CHITCHAT
Awesome thank you Michael.	CHITCHAT
Well, I hope.	CHITCHAT
I hope it works, but it works out for you with that.	CHITCHAT
If I turn it into black and white that might help me figure out what's going on in the foreground here.	O
It's nice to have time to be able to.	O
Coming here and work on these things at the end.	O
I often do a lot of the time studies that are.	CHITCHAT
Know about half of this time frame.	CHITCHAT
So it's nice to be able to come in here and workout this these things.	CHITCHAT
Try to get to a good level of finish at the end.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think we can have more green, catching the light so maybe for example.	O
Some little grasses and things coming up here.	O
I think it would be maybe darker.	O
And then if it comes up above the.	O
That rock.	O
Maybe we get it by the light and have more of like a bright green.	O
Warmer color.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
And maybe we can have some to have different.	O
Type of texture like maybe some individual leaves something more like a Bush rather than.	O
Then.	CHITCHAT
Reeds or I don't know what he called that like.	O
Pulling a blank.	O
But you will get a Bush with some larger leaves here.	O
Instead of just like the grass is.	O
A Jackson thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much welcome do you remember this one I think it was suggested recently?	CHITCHAT
I really like the reference so I'm going to do it now.	CHITCHAT
Body like it, I changed a few things about it not too much, but I wanted to.	O
Do a little bit more with the foreground.	O
I added some rocks and stuff, it's not.	O
Still, not right on yet but.	O
Go a little bit more do a little bit more.	O
Foliage up here that would be nice.	O
Not be happy.	O
We need the textured brush just do.	O
Bring in some scraggly texture here, we can pay on Top of it.	O
Sometimes in a pinch it's really nice too.	O

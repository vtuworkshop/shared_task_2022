Combine.	O
Painting your own textures, with a little bit of extra brushes, so they can get you started and then you can come in and.	O
Add.	O
Pain on Top of it, so you're able to get a little bit more done.	O
Dark in this just going to keep everything pretty dark in between here.	O
I think I'm just gonna drag in this whole area.	O
Decisions decisions.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, I think for like the dark increases in between the rocks we can definitely use the darkest shadow.	O
Then I read a little bit more crisp.	O
And where is that?	CHITCHAT
Shadi texture brush 'cause I think we can come in at this stage and maybe add some real texture.	O
See the rocks that are closest to us as we would actually be seeing them close enough to.	O
Pick that up.	O
I don't want to add too much texture like this on rocks that are or details that are too far away in the distance of the scene.	O
Hope you guys are doing well, it's been a very sleepy few days in the Netherlands.	CHITCHAT
It's just actually even last week.	CHITCHAT
It's just been very rainy today was so nice actually.	CHITCHAT
I I didn't get to go outside yet, but maybe after this, I will actually sunny.	CHITCHAT
Thanks, Eric.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
I got this on map grants yesterday that was nice.	CHITCHAT
Alright let me take a look at what you found.	CHITCHAT
Oh, this is a nice one.	CHITCHAT
I like that there's some some animals in here to some goats.	CHITCHAT
That's cool.	CHITCHAT
There's some really, really cool scenes in that area.	CHITCHAT
I've seen some good references in Bhutan.	CHITCHAT
What a unique place?	CHITCHAT
Oh, I covered the chat There you are.	CHITCHAT
Feel like we learned completely different skill set from the speed studies.	CHITCHAT
I think both help us in different ways.	CHITCHAT
You mean the ones like this, where we're taking a little longer to do it.	CHITCHAT
And I'm glad to hear that.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think there is different things that come into play.	CHITCHAT
When you take a little bit longer on a painting you have to get into some more things with polishing and stuff, and slightly different.	CHITCHAT
Slightly different workflow things when you get to that stage.	CHITCHAT
Speaking of soon.	CHITCHAT
I will start to just do finishing effects, and things were getting to that point.	O
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
Add a little bit more texture on this Bush over here.	O
Some warm warm fixture.	O
Maybe not that warm.	O
We still want it to match the color scheme of the painting.	O
But.	CHITCHAT
Maybe something more purple.	O
Back it up back it up.	O

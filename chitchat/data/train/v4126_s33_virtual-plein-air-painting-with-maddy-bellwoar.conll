Not find the right color.	O
There we go.	CHITCHAT
Better.	O
All right over here, I want to kind of the same thing.	O
We gotta add some little grass is foliage, something interesting.	O
Over here.	O
Facing towards	O
The light.	O
We're going to have little Tufts of a brighter green.	O
And I will do that going down.	O
Just more saturated bringing color little warmer.	O
I want a little bit more of the feeling that this is overlapping here.	O
I'm also a little scared of doing any major changes at this point.	O
Almost done.	CHITCHAT
That feels better.	O
Little bright green, maybe more towards blue.	O
Who birth mother right color?	CHITCHAT
Oh.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's just funny when you pick really Brown colors.	CHITCHAT
Smack in the face like does not work.	CHITCHAT
Alright so let's get a little tuft of.	O
Grass is or something over here, I'm just going to use a textured brush.	O
Same things over on the right.	O
Just gonna bring some more warm colors.	O
Maybe a little bit more purple.	O
Again, the Purples better than the Red Red Orange.	O
Reducing a little more contrast would be great.	O
It is really high contrast in like more than more than usual for my.	O
Some of my paintings, but I don't know.	O
I don't know if I if it's really possible for me to do it.	O
Without changing like the way the painting reads I can kind of try.	O
I guess OK, so the background.	O
I'm like happy with the contrast.	O
But what I don't like is the rocks like?	O
They seemed to contrast.	O
Just the foreground, but if you look at the reference.	O
You you'll see like what I was.	CHITCHAT
Looking at but that's the part that's bothering me.	CHITCHAT
If I had to say.	CHITCHAT
You're amazing Ohio, thank you.	CHITCHAT
That's very nice of you.	CHITCHAT
Thank you.	CHITCHAT
The trees out a little bit of what I did there.	O
But let's try I have an idea of something that can help with the rocks and we'll see if it works.	O
So I'm going to make a new layer and choose like a textured brush.	O
I think we can.	O
Take some of the shadows here and.	O
Put a little bit of a different introduce a new color that doesn't currently exist on the rock.	O
There's like a?	O
Dark.	O
Muted warm.	O
Brown color.	O
In the reference.	O
In some of the shadows.	O
And I think if I replace the?	O
Some of the dark dark shadows.	O
With this.	O
Then it might appear a little less.	O
We were done with the darks, but What are the values look like so when I look at it in black and white?	O

That's what we get.	O
When you look at the reference that's what you see so.	O
I think I kind of lost the big shapes on the rock.	O
It got too into like these tiny little highlights and shadows.	O
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Lost like the The form a little bit.	O
So maybe I could bring that back in if I get rid of some of the.	O
The little details.	O
Still, trying to figure out what tablet is being used for me.	CHITCHAT
I'm using Wacom Centriq 22 HD.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I thought I answered earlier.	CHITCHAT
But yeah, it's a 22 inch screen tablet.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I'm continuing to darken poop poop poop.	CHITCHAT
Notice you look down while painting, yeah, exactly.	O
Yeah, I am looking at a screen that is correct.	O
A little bit more shadow over.	O
Yeah, and some of the bounce lights probably too, too much.	O
But Hey,	CHITCHAT
That's why we do these you learn something every time.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I will merge everything.	O
And make a new layer.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
We can try to add a little bit more.	O
Atmosphere atmospheric perspective to help separate the.	O
Foreground.	O
So I'm just going to make a selection.	O
To do, I'm not going to.	CHITCHAT
Worry too much about being perfect, but trade.	CHITCHAT
In the rocks selected.	O
Mila says if you lose the big shape like you mentioned with the rock is it possible to fix it or is it better to be happy accident.	CHITCHAT
I think it depends on your goals for the painting are.	CHITCHAT
Like if it's just so study, then you can try to spend some effort fixing it.	CHITCHAT
But you know if it's time study.	CHITCHAT
Then you know you might just say it is what it is like trying to fix it.	CHITCHAT
But in my case, we're doing a 3 hour study so I can't necessarily.	CHITCHAT
You know fix it perfectly.	CHITCHAT
I'll just do a little fix what I can.	CHITCHAT
And then move on.	CHITCHAT
And just understand that you know you learn and get better on the next painting and that's something that you can remember for the future when you do like similar kind of environment.	CHITCHAT
So you learn from that, if it's like a client work or something you should probably try to fix it so that your.	CHITCHAT
Painting looks good that you're giving is a final result.	CHITCHAT
That kind of depends on it's just how much time and effort.	CHITCHAT
You want to work into trying to fix it.	CHITCHAT
It is possible to fix things.	CHITCHAT
But sometimes it can be really tricky when you're working on a foundation of something that is.	CHITCHAT
That is a little off, sometimes it's even easier to start over.	CHITCHAT

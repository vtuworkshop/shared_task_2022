With that thing like you can you know maybe?	CHITCHAT
Try repainting that section or redoing it in the future like re trying the study.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's hard to fix things it is possible but.	CHITCHAT
Depending on the situation.	CHITCHAT
It can be more or less easy to do like certain things are like really easy to fix.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes they'll be something that you can just use a quick select something photo shop do a quick filter or just alter something and bam.	CHITCHAT
It's fixed, but it kind of depends on the specific scenario.	CHITCHAT
How labor intensive fixing that thing might be.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright so put a little bit more of a glow to separate the foreground in the background.	O
Emerge that down, make a new layer put it on, I'm gonna try to darken mode.	O
And see if I can just.	O
Make a more cohesive feeling to the colors in the foreground.	O
You still feel like.	CHITCHAT
The rocks don't feel as much part of the scene as they could.	O
Little bit pasted in but But it might be harsh critique.	O
It's not bad?	CHITCHAT
I'm actually happy with the painting, but I'm nitpicking that because you know.	CHITCHAT
Can be better?	CHITCHAT
Merge those together.	O
Almost done.	O
You try one more thing.	O
Make a selection of the rock again.	O
It would've been easier's on his own layer, but it's fine.	O
Most the time emerging things is makes me makes my process faster so for the few times that it doesn't.	O
And I have to Reselect, something it's OK, but I'm going to make an adjustment layer.	O
So it's under my Camera, but there's little half circle icon down there going to press that and go to.	O
Let's try selective color.	O
I think maybe.	CHITCHAT
Maybe I could mess with.	O
Some of the Some some colors on the rock.	O
Might be able to change some things.	O
I when it comes to this, this kind of adjustment.	O
I am just completely winging it.	CHITCHAT
See Select Reselect.	O
Maybe maybe that wasn't the way to go, maybe like curves or levels could have been better.	O
Yeah, there, we go.	CHITCHAT
So lowering the mid tones.	O
That might help with Lower the idea of lowering the contrast a little bit.	O
So I can.	O
Soften the edges of that mask a little bit.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Maybe be like that better.	O
Yeah, I'm at, I'm at maybe it's better like this.	CHITCHAT
I think I think I.	CHITCHAT
I think it's a little more relaxing.	CHITCHAT
That's a little.	CHITCHAT
Later.	CHITCHAT
And then I can just.	O
Erase out or yeah, mask out a couple.	O
Darker areas again.	O
OK, going to Bridget.	CHITCHAT

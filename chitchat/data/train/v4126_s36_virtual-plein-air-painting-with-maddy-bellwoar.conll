Yeah, so I think we're about done sometimes at the end I like to.	O
Make a little shadow.	O
Around the outside just to keep our eye focused towards the center and lower the opacity quite alot 'cause.	O
We don't want it.	CHITCHAT
We don't need to be so crazy.	O
But I think it, fits this kind of lighting scenario to have that.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Tiny bit more blue here at the end.	O
What's going on with overlay an just boosting up the color in a couple places where I?	O
Wouldn't mind some extra saturation?	O
I don't want to go crazy at the end and totally change the painting.	O
But maybe it like.	CHITCHAT
A little more warmth in the center.	O
And you're facing towards the light.	O
That.	CHITCHAT
Going to smoke out some things around here.	O
I think we're almost done.	CHITCHAT
The last thing I'm going to do is.	O
When final color, Dodge layer.	O
I want it to be.	O
Just to give a little glow to the center of the cloud.	O
And lower the Opacity 'cause, it got pretty intense but.	O
The know how for the step you're doing right now with overlay.	O
Just comes with practice.	O
Yeah, it's just just following your instincts on like there's something feel.	O
Does it feel good does it feel done?	O
Does it feel like it needs a little extra magic to it like I don't always you always have to do.	O
That step, but I felt like it needed a little off.	O
In some places.	O
Add some brighter.	O
Leave here too.	CHITCHAT
And I think it's pretty much done.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes I'll lower the opacity after doing the finishing effects.	O
That's why I like to do it on a separate layer.	O
Sometimes it changes the mood more than I expect so then I'll lower the Opacity and.	O
That the original throughout the show through a little bit more but.	O
Overall, I'm I think I'm happy with this one at the very least.	CHITCHAT
I'm happy with this guy and the water.	CHITCHAT
The foreground didn't come out as nice as I was hoping but.	CHITCHAT
Still, an enjoyable painting and a really epic spot.	CHITCHAT
It was nice to look at this while I was painting throughout this dream.	CHITCHAT

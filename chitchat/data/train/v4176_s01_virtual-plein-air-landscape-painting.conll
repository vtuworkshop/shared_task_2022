I think it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
I love the lighting the bright light on the left and the shadows and the rushing water.	O
I think it's going to be a little bit of a challenge as a lot of things that I need practice in like rocks and the water texture.	O
I think is gonna be interesting try show the motion.	O
But my my intention here.	CHITCHAT
It's Fazio my gosh.	CHITCHAT
I feel like I don't even know if I ever knew that.	CHITCHAT
Your name was Madeline I feel like I would have remembered that anyway spoilers.	CHITCHAT
I hope you don't mind you can always go and edit your name if you wanted to make it a different name.	CHITCHAT
So if if privacy is a thing you can change that.	CHITCHAT
But thanks for coming by high Missouri great to see you, you guys can grab the reference.	CHITCHAT
If you're interested in painting along but yeah, I'm going to put this on my other monitor and actually let me also.	CHITCHAT
Put a little thumbnail view of what I'm going to be painting on the screen.	CHITCHAT
So we can see that while we are painting.	CHITCHAT
It's not much, but it still helps a little bit, I think.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Yay.	CHITCHAT
Without the extra EI know my name has a lot of ease in it.	CHITCHAT
He had no worries, no worries.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I didn't even see the mantis one yet.	CHITCHAT
I'm gonna lookout for that later Missouri.	CHITCHAT
OK, well, let's begin so my when I do studies.	CHITCHAT
I like to try to budget my time.	CHITCHAT
An you know pick a certain amount of time that I want the study to be completed in.	CHITCHAT
It just kind of helps me pay attention more to what I'm doing and.	CHITCHAT
But I have to make more deliberate decisions in in my art so my goal is to finish this in.	CHITCHAT
2 to 3 hours.	CHITCHAT
I'm thinking probably 3, so I want to do something I want to do get a nice result at the end of this so I'm just going to keep an eye on the time throughout the stream and you know, kind of budget that the level of detail depending on that, so, so let's start with the sketch.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to begin the usual way, which is establishing the horizon line.	O
This one, it seems like we're going to kind of do 1/3 Sky at the Top and then 2/3, is going to be water and mud and everything like that.	O
Is the tool things enabled yes?	CHITCHAT
I did I do have the tool timeline and it is capturing but it's possible that I I think it might be only might be only viewable in the replay.	O
Uh.	CHITCHAT
I think I think that's how it works.	CHITCHAT
I'm still learning everything.	CHITCHAT
Here, too, is my second stream on be hands and I'm excited to be here.	CHITCHAT
But I'm I'm learning how everything works.	CHITCHAT
I'm not exactly sure.	CHITCHAT
I think from what happened with the first dream.	CHITCHAT
I think that the tool capture will be available during the video replay.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
So you can check that later but that's going to be really cool.	CHITCHAT
Then there's some new things in the tool timeline so the new version is like capturing more information, so I'm curious to see.	O
Hey shadow craft thanks for coming by.	CHITCHAT
Nice to meet you and you knew shadowcraft person, it doesn't work that way does it.	CHITCHAT
Anyway, OK, OK so.	CHITCHAT
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
New layer I'm going to start with the big shapes.	O
So when doing these kind of studies.	O
There is a lot going on in the scene.	O
So it helps to kind of break it down into starting big to small and just focusing on like the biggest and most important shapes you see in the scene and if anything.	O
If you want to stylize you can kind of exaggerate them.	O
But the key is we want to get into any details yet.	O
We wanna stay with B.	CHITCHAT
Want to keep this on like a big picture level right now.	O
Robert Hey, dust, good to see you thanks for coming.	CHITCHAT
Ha ha.	CHITCHAT
How Is Everybody?	CHITCHAT
OK, so one thing that I really like in this scene is the overlap where you see the bright light hitting left side in the back and then we get kind of a silhouette where like the darker rocks are coming down at the front and then we get extra bit of light where the Sky is reflecting off of the wet like the mud in the water.	O

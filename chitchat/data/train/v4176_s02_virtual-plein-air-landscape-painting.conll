That's pouring through here and it's it's really cool.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot of different textures, an movement in this.	O
I like it, I think it's a challenging one.	CHITCHAT
The perspective is a little odd were like down low on the ground, but that's kind of cool something different.	O
No.	O
Well, I'm glad you're doing better phasing.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I'm focusing this is almost like the landscape well.	CHITCHAT
I guess it is the landscape version of a gesture drawing like in figure, drawing where you would focus on the.	O
The gesture of the pose and not worry too much about like the specific anatomy.	O
That's kind of what I'm doing right now.	O
Just sketching and trying to stay loose and trying to just focus on like the movement.	O
The overall a big shapes and the movement of this.	O
Particular scene, the personality of it.	O
Things will probably change I don't like to get super super detailed like I don't go past sketching into any kind of real line work because usually when I get into the painting Phase I like things to be flexible.	O
I like to figure a lot of stuff out in the painting Phase I just use.	O
This sketch to get me started so it's not completely off the wall.	O
If I try to go in with shapes in the beginning and I haven't sketched anything that can be really difficult to do.	O
It's kind of fun, sometimes, but if you want good results.	CHITCHAT
It can be really tough to be specific.	CHITCHAT
Um.	CHITCHAT
I know I did miss you guys.	CHITCHAT
Well, I wanted to do I wanted to do a stream here this week and yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's just crazy.	CHITCHAT
He's just been been crazy, and today seems like a good opportunity since.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I had the evening available.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't sure because you guys know is a recently 6.	CHITCHAT
I wasn't sure how my stamina was going to be for streaming tonight.	CHITCHAT
But I'm actually feeling good, I got some tea.	CHITCHAT
So excuse me.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, so I'm good.	CHITCHAT
All that's nice.	CHITCHAT
That's nice best well thanks for popping in to say Hey.	CHITCHAT
Spoiler alert I memati I've been told gestures and everything, not only figures.	CHITCHAT
Starting your learning with gesturing figures an easier introduction.	CHITCHAT
That's so cool, yeah, I'm kind of sort of discovering that myself, too, it seems.	CHITCHAT
Like you can put gesture into everything.	CHITCHAT
Even even rocks, they have like a movement to them.	O
Alright, I'm this is almost done as far as like the sketch for me.	O
Although I do use transform tools and my sketching phase, oftentimes will notice like the proportions and my original go at the sketch or not right like for example, these rocks should be a lot closer to us so to really sell the idea that.	O
On the left side of the canvas it's getting closer.	O
These are getting closer to us I need to.	O
Into layer them like this.	O
All right?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
That's better.	O
So that's why I like to try to do my Horizon Line on a separate layer because all this stuff.	O
Isn't disturbing it while I'm messing with everything here?	O
So I'm just going to race out.	O
The horizon line wherever it's not needed anymore.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Think will be good to go.	CHITCHAT
You know, I didn't think of this, but I probably should have put a Gray background.	O
So you guys don't have to.	O
See this bright white kind of harsh to sketch on.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
Do you pay much attention to the horizon when you're painting or just get it for the initial sketch just for the initial sketch because it helps me place it helps me get a?	O

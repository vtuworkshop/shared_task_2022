Feeling of the perspective.	O
Not that I I'm not usually one to like pull out perspective grids and start getting too.	O
Precise with it, but it just gives me a starting .2.	O
Base everything off of.	O
Let's zoom in a little bit.	O
Yeah, that's that's better.	CHITCHAT
Alright so I want to because I.	O
Extended the line work outside of the edge of the cannabis.	CHITCHAT
I want to get rid of the extra so I'm going to click the crop tool, it's going to.	O
But the cropping box around my whole canvas.	O
And I can just check off delete cropped pixels and press enter and it's going to drop off all that extra stuff, so I can just have a nice clean.	O
Canvas.	O
Never liked perspective grids, too much eyeballing in roof perspective is a lot easier to handle yeah.	O
I think you know for certain types of illustration when you really have to be precise than you might have to go in that direction.	O
But for the type of painting that I do.	O
It's I don't get into as much technical stuff with buildings and things so I can usually eyeball it.	O
Are you doing?	CHITCHAT
An underpainting that's an interesting idea?	CHITCHAT
It's nice to do an underpainting.	O
With scenes like this because.	O
I just think that the color palette work would work well well for it.	O
But.	O
There's also some nice clean things about this Sky.	O
I'm just going to.	CHITCHAT
I'm just going to go with my instincts on this and see where that leads I did to be honest.	O
I didn't have too much of a plan.	O
Yet exactly what workflow I was going to use.	O
Usually I I think most artists have, like a couple different workflows and it kind of depends on the scene, where they're going to wear direction.	O
They're going to go in.	O
Sounds good fizi enjoy your food.	CHITCHAT
So I think I'm going to start with the Sky.	O
I usually start with going back to front and big to small with shapes so for me.	O
Oh yeah, I'm going to take the layer with the sketch and just put that on a lower opacity.	O
And put the layer under multiply so it's a little easier to see through and just lock.	O
The layer up here and then I'm going to paint on a layer below that so.	O
One thing I could do is instead of having a grape background as a as an underpainting sort of idea.	O
I could just throw a color back there, it doesn't necessarily have to be.	O
Hand painted it's nice sometimes if you want to use like a textured brush to do the under paintings that will give a little more of a traditional vibe, but we could use something like that just to get rid of the.	O
Blank canvas and put a color there rather than rather than blue.	O
I mean, Gray and now we're going to go into the blue Sky.	O
So usually I just well.	CHITCHAT
They usually almost always I.	CHITCHAT
I like to just look at the reference and try to.	O
Select colors based on just kind of eyeballing it.	O
So I'm not always 100% on with the colours.	O
I pick but.	O
Doing that is good practice.	O
Being able to.	O
See the colors and.	O
Identify them kind of recreate them and it makes painting little faster thing.	O
When you get more comfortable with that.	O
So basically that's just the start of the Sky, I can even merge it down.	O
And then I'm going to keep this for me, there's like 2 Main.	O
Things I want to keep separate in this scene.	O
One is the Sky and one is basically everything else.	O
The rocks come up in front of the Sky.	O
So I think it's might be pretty handy to keep this guy on it separate layer.	O
So I can work on clouds and stuff back there without getting interrupted by.	O
The overlapping Canyon.	O
So I'm just holding shift to continue, adding to the selection 'cause not easy to make a perfect selection in one go.	O
Blocking in with Airbrush.	O
Um that's what I did for the Sky that was just the Airbrush back there.	O

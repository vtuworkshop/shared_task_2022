For the rest of it.	O
Yeah, I probably will begin with the airbrush usually I'll block in with either an airbrush or like a solid rectangular painting brush and it depends on how much texture.	O
I want in that thing or it depends on a number of things, which one I'm going to go with.	O
But for this, I think.	O
There's enough of a reason I I think I would choose an airbrush for this is if you look at the reference.	O
Even though there's rocks.	O
And a lot of different details and shadow that we can add in later.	O
There's really like a pretty smooth gradient.	O
If you just look at the scene like at least everything in the shadows.	O
There's there's a pretty smooth gradient.	O
I think it would be nice to start off with the airbrush so let me just drop in a color too.	O
Create the shape here and then I'll explain more.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Now that I have this shape.	O
I can go to the lock transparency button up here and just check that down the checkerboard.	O
Button appear if I break that down.	O
Then the transparency is locked on the layer so anything that I do.	O
It's only going to affect that shape and it doesn't affect the background also makes it really easy to come up.	O
Here and just kind of with the airbrush on a really large size.	O
It just start giving a big gradient and putting all this and shadow up here and just kind of looking at the reference.	O
Just kind of matching what I see maybe there's a little bit more warm color here, so I'll just go to my.	O
Color wheel go a little bit more warm little bit more towards red, orange, going towards Orange.	O
And look at how much it starts kind of matching with the scene with no level of detail whatsoever.	O
That's why I really like using gradients to begin blocking things in 'cause, you can start getting a feeling for the scene really quick and then go on Top and start giving your details and.	O
If you're doing, especially for doing a speed paint or something like that one of these virtual Plein Air Studies.	O
It's a quick way to get your painting started and get to a certain point quickly so.	O
We have some highlights here now, what I'm not going to do is paint in in this stage like the really, really bright lights.	O
If you look at the reference.	O
There's like a layer of reflection on Top of the water.	O
So I'm almost like pretending I don't see that and just painting as if it's the colour that exists.	O
Like Ah if you're seeing through the water rather than the reflection.	O
I'll paint that separately.	O
So that we can get the hard edges and the texture of it.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
What next I think the next biggest shape or most important thing is the lighting on the left?	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Because there's such a hard edged dramatic edge here just going to make a selection.	O
Around the area of The Shadow and just selecting the only the area that I want my brush to be able to effect and I'm just going to make a big selection of that, so I still have the lock transparency and now I've also selected an even smaller area.	O
So now my brushes only going to affect this spot so.	O
You say you're going to stream for 3 hours when you're going to eat.	CHITCHAT
I actually ate some sushi right before the stream so I'm very happy.	CHITCHAT
Don't worry don't worry.	CHITCHAT
I'm now.	CHITCHAT
I can't go without eating very, very long so I definitely had to take care of that, but thank you for thinking about me.	CHITCHAT
So the brightest lights coming in here.	O
Something like that.	CHITCHAT
And there, we go it doesn't look great.	O
But it's just the blocking end just phase number one we can add a little bit more warm light, maybe there, we go.	O
All right.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
At some point we can actually take away the sketch, but not yet not yet not even close.	O
Where to block in a lot more things and then we have to do that.	O
Now I want sushi, I know doesn't thing when you it's like coffee and Sushi.	CHITCHAT
If you even say the word.	CHITCHAT
It's like now, I need that every time.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT

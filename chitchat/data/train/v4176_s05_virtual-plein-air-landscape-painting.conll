So next thing.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to focus on the rocks before we get into any foliage.	O
I can get the rock structure down and be happy foliage is kind of A.	O
That's going to be like the icing on Top of the cake in this one.	O
And get all the rocks done 1st.	O
So Speaking of that I think let's get into our first layer of shading.	O
So I'm going to make a new layer right click that layer and go to create clipping mask so this kind of has the same effect of the lock transparency, so now I can paint here.	O
Anywhere I want over this whole shape, but it's on a separate layer.	O
So it's not just restricting to within that shape but also I can move it around.	O
I can change it.	O
I can get rid of the layer entirely so it's a little bit less destructive an I can.	O
Yeah, it just let's me.	CHITCHAT
Be a little bit more careful.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I have heard that before I have heard that that's a saying in French.	CHITCHAT
We're walking stomachs.	CHITCHAT
I've heard.	CHITCHAT
I think I've heard my mom accused accuse me of that.	CHITCHAT
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, OK?	CHITCHAT
What am I doing we're painting.	CHITCHAT
Let's get the OK.	CHITCHAT
Let me show you want.	O
My favorite brushes is this basic flat brush.	O
Like we talked about to sushi for 2 seconds and I'm like already.	CHITCHAT
What am I doing?	CHITCHAT
So we're going to make a selection.	O
Basically, the area.	O
I'm working on right now is on the right side Top right side of this rock up here.	O
The Canyon has really cool effect of drips like water.	O
Yeah, I don't know what it actually is I don't know if it's some kind of mold or just the rock is colored from water going down.	O
But it's cool look so I'm going to select.	O
The whole area where that effect is taking place.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
It goes behind some other stuff at some point so.	O
We won't worry about it, too much there, but Creating like a little Stencil area that's like a stencil for myself.	O
So now.	CHITCHAT
I can find the color.	O
I want to use for that.	O
Area of the Rock and maybe I'll use a little bit more of a of a textured brush.	O
Maybe something like this would be better.	O
Yeah, I was just kind of lightly bring this sort of striping look down.	O
Down the rock.	O
And then I can deselect.	O
And there, you go it was a nice way to like stay in the lines.	O
It looks like there's some.	O
I can just sort of freehand paint here.	O
This is where we're going to have.	O
Some fully age and things to when we get to that point, so right now.	O
I'm just going to sketch things in a little bit.	O
This is like the rock like the base that we're going to end up Pudding.	O
Plants on so a lot of this is going to be covered.	O
Phasing where did you hear that one from 'cause my mom used to say that to my mom has all the old sayings like she knows all those like idioms and things where you it's kind of like a colloquialism.	CHITCHAT
I guess you could also say she knows all of those she's always saying funny stuff.	CHITCHAT
But thanks to her.	CHITCHAT
I know what a lot of those things mean which is also kind of handy.	CHITCHAT
OK, so I'm trying to think what's the next thing going to be there's a there's a little bit more of this effect coming down here.	O
Mrs I heard of hollow leg for drinkers OK.	CHITCHAT
Well, I don't think that pertains to a phasis child funny.	CHITCHAT
Alright so.	CHITCHAT
OK up here we're just going to dust some more purple Gray.	O
Uh there's so many pretty colors in this scene.	O
I like how the Canyon has these layers and layers.	O
Also I'm kind of working with the exception of the left side 'cause that was just a large area that I thought made sense to block in the light with the exception of that I'm mostly working dark to light so.	O
I have to be a little bit patient.	O
'cause I am I'm looking forward to putting in highlights at the Top of that area.	O
I was just working on.	O
I think it's really going to make it pop and show the layers a little bit better.	O

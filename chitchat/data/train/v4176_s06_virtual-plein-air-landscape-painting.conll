The layers of rock like going up and up to the Top but.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Gotta go.	CHITCHAT
In order you don't have to go in the same order as me, but you know if you had workflow and it's good to kind of.	O
Stick with it unless you're particularly experimenting but I found that going.	O
Dark to light is in most situations is going to be more efficient.	O
'cause you can kind of get away with illustrating less things.	O
And things that faded into shadow your brain just kind of accepts them and you don't really have to illustrate so much in those areas and then the highlights really pop out.	O
So I like doing dark to light the only downside is really while you're working.	O
You kind of have to be patient during some early stages, where you're just waiting for to add those that pop in the highlights so.	O
It's going to be fun, we can put them in.	CHITCHAT
So there's a large rock here with an interesting shape and some cool markings on the side.	O
But I think I'm just going to sketch in the.	O
The location of the Iraq and I think I'm going to do that all around the rocks just kind of establish them a little bit better.	O
And then we'll get into the shading and texture in detailing.	O
I've seen it a couple of type of scenes in this location.	CHITCHAT
I'd really like to see this in person.	CHITCHAT
Someday, this is Fry Canyon in Utah and I've seen so many beautiful pictures from Utah.	CHITCHAT
I've never been there.	CHITCHAT
And one of the things I like most of the scene is that the water and the.	O
And the rocks are.	O
Reflecting light from the Sky and they have this like very delicate light purple light blue reflection off of just the just the sides.	O
The rock that are facing towards the Sky.	O
Right so rocks over here, a little closer to us.	O
I also want to.	O
Figure out where they are.	O
Get some of the where some of the cracks are going to be in some of the edges.	O
I like to use the smudge brush.	O
I haven't really gotten to a place where we need to use it.	O
A lot yet.	O
But as I get into the rendering.	O
I'll probably use it a bit.	O
I really like the smudge brush, especially in combination with the lasso tool airbrush.	O
To smooth out some of those hard edges.	O
So I may not be reproducing every location of every rock correctly to the reference but that's not super important to me.	O
I just want to get.	O
The feeling of the scene.	O
Oh, OK that's murder.	CHITCHAT
That's why I was like what am I doing?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
There we go.	CHITCHAT
So if we want to make this rock a little bit higher.	O
The only thing I don't want that I'm starting to get here is.	O
You want to avoid especially if you're painting natural scenes, especially but I think in general.	O
You want to avoid having like the same size shape.	O
Repeated over and over again, you kind of want to have a little bit of an all altering thier sizes of your shapes that will make it more interesting just better design, so these rocks right now, it's kind of like boom boom boom copy paste like they're looking very.	O
Matchy Matchy Matchy, I'm going to merge these layers together so.	O
There we go now I can work freely here.	O
But I'm going to move some things so I can change the size the sizes of the rocks.	O
So make that one a little bit bigger.	O
Is closest to us?	O
And merge it down this one over here.	O
Oh, I forgot I need to make that on you layer.	O

The most distant one, I'm going to make it smaller.	O
And then we'll figure out the middle the rock in the middle.	O
They still look the same.	O
Why?	CHITCHAT
Who?	CHITCHAT
OK, I think I'm seeing the problem, so in the reference.	O
This rock in the back has more the feeling that it's on a higher level.	O
Like there's actually more.	O
Land that comes in between them more of the.	O
The rock.	O
And then it comes down, and there's there's just a feeling of more distance between the second third.	O
Second third rocks.	O
So let's try that.	O
Troubleshooting.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we have, like the the water that's reflecting the Sky.	O
That's coming down through here.	O
Something like that little zigzag.	O
Thanks, Basey.	CHITCHAT
Ciroc Sarah puzzle so you have the sketch layer background color layer layer.	CHITCHAT
We started adding in the darks.	O
Yes, that's correct so the layers.	O
I have right now are this funny background just gradient of the Sky these rocks.	O
And then the sketch on Top an what I'm working on I emerged.	O
The layer with the shadows so that I could more easily.	O
Make changes to that.	O
I know it might be counter intuitive but I like to merge stuff.	O
'cause then when it when I'm doing this kind of study.	O
I don't like to keep so many separate layers.	O
I feel like at some point, it makes me slower.	O
As well, he says for me, it's sketch layer background layer dark layer light layer and then details wow.	O
That's awesome.	CHITCHAT
That seems so organized.	O
OK, so.	CHITCHAT
Let's start.	O
Shading in some of these rocks.	O
Then merged panic panic.	O
Phase of your just all over the place.	O
I used to have a million layers just a million layers.	CHITCHAT
When I would when I would paint I was so scared of?	CHITCHAT
Getting rid of a layer and then regretting it later.	CHITCHAT
So it's Vinik transformation for me to go from that to having a pretty minimal amount.	O
Still work on the workflow thing that's totally normal.	O
That's very, very.	CHITCHAT
All right there, we go so I'm using the lasso tool to block off an area.	O
The Top of this rock that's facing up towards the Sky.	O
And that's going to have some blue reflection.	O
And then I'm going to do the same thing for this rock just going to select the rock just the area that's getting lit by bound flight.	O
The left hand side of the rocks are getting reflection from this wall so they're getting like an orange glow and then the right is getting lit by the Sky, so that's so pretty so pretty.	O
Alright so I want to bring the edge of this rock back in so we have a nice clean silhouette.	O
I'm there.	O
And it's starting to get better, so I'm going to get a little better.	O
I love again this is a lasso tool an airbrush doing almost all the work right now because it's amazing detail really comes second to just getting the right values and colors in place even if everything is smooth.	O

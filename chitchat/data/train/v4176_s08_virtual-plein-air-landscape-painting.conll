That's kind of the most important thing for the painting to read well and then we can get into the fancy stuff.	O
Yeah, separately issued based shading lighting.	O
Yeah, I used to do the same thing do you group your layers?	O
At least that they can help a little bit organized things when you have a ton.	O
Alright so I'm going to flip my campus.	O
And I'm actually going to put my reference to on the other monitor.	CHITCHAT
I have a larger version of my reference on my left monitor here so I can.	CHITCHAT
Go look at that.	CHITCHAT
You use the clipping masks Oh OK cool so you just have a bunch of 'em clip down there?	O
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
I swear we went the same path fasy you're going to be fine.	CHITCHAT
I did the same exact thing.	CHITCHAT
It just takes a little bit too.	CHITCHAT
Get comfortable with.	CHITCHAT
'Cause and some artists always have a lot of layers.	CHITCHAT
There's nothing there's nothing wrong with that.	CHITCHAT
But I think you will get more confident with merging somethings earlier you know as you go your painting.	CHITCHAT
See.	CHITCHAT
Well, if you guys are working on any artworks or anything.	CHITCHAT
I hope it's all going well.	CHITCHAT
This down.	CHITCHAT
To show a little bit more of that rock back there.	O
Flipping the canvas gave me a little bit more of a fresh.	O
View so.	O
Look again.	CHITCHAT
Try something with the rocks.	O
Different line layers.	O
Great.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, if I had to only use three brushes, I probably.	O
Do hard round brush soft air brush and smudge smudge brush.	O
Oh, cool, Feizi we're going to look at some of those.	CHITCHAT
Tomorrow.	CHITCHAT
If you want to do share a work in progress or not there's no pressure.	CHITCHAT
Alright guys so.	CHITCHAT
I'm right now, emerging so that I have this background, the rocks and everything and then the sketch.	O
An I think what I'm actually going to do is just select the area that I need from the sketch.	O
The only thing that I really need from there now is the little bit where the water is because everything else is.	O
Already been painted in enough that I don't really need to sketch anymore so.	O
I'm going to take this and merge it down.	O
So yeah, we can really probably just erase the sketch now, so we're down to 2 layers.	O
And time Wise I think we're doing pretty good.	CHITCHAT
We have a couple hours left so I think this is good base.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to go back to that rectangle texture brush.	O
I'm going to make a new layer above what I'm doing and just hand paint a little bit.	O
We did a bit of airbrushing.	O
And now I'm going to come in and do some painting with A paintbrush.	O

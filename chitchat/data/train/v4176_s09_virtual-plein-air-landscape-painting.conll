I like to mix them together, 'cause I feel like the airbrushes convenient and.	O
Quick but I like the look of of the hand to hand painted look of actually using using brushes and getting texture and stuff, so.	O
Can I go back and forth?	O
Started this one over the first attempt was a disaster.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I know how that is, I know.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes it's a really smart idea to start fresh on something it's just not working and you're feeling bad when you work on it, you're just not not into it.	CHITCHAT
Comparisons best 3rd over.	CHITCHAT
I like that blue purple color that I kind of chose by accident.	O
I'm going to add a little bit of that to the Top of this.	O
'Cause there's some were talking about the light from the Sky, bouncing off there's a little bit of like a light purple kind of affect up here.	O
Right I'm going to select there's some rocks in the centre here and I didn't really sketch them out there kind of smaller, so I'm just going to select with the airbrush.	O
The shapes of the rocks that I want to use and hopefully my airbrush selection is going to be nice enough we'll see.	O
Little shadow on the side.	O
Making a little smaller.	O
Right I think that's fine.	O
Grab the airbrush an add a little shadow, so the lights coming from behind these rocks.	O
So they're going to have.	O
Shadow on the ground right underneath them.	O
Right so selecting an area and going to bring that shadow from the underneath the behind the rocks.	O
There's also some darker rocks.	O
And a little area of water over on the right which is I don't know how yet to illustrate this is one of the reasons that I chose this piece.	O
There's a couple textures in here that are.	O
Kinda new to me.	O
The rushing water near the foreground and then some of the areas that are like these shallow, reflecting pools in the back.	O
Curious.	CHITCHAT
How it's going to go hopefully I will be able to figure it out?	CHITCHAT
Thank you crazy thank you.	CHITCHAT
These rocks have some pretty cool patterns on them.	O
So I'm going to select.	O
Where I want to be able to brush in my lighter color?	O
Sort of Terra Cotta.	O
Color here.	O
Some of that up here also.	O
Yeah, the right we have a more warm warm colors.	O
Well, except for obviously here of a Top left there's some really, really bright warm colors.	O
But.	O
The shadow on the left is pretty cool.	O
I really like these little.	O
Oh, that's too bright these areas of Red Brown.	O
Cutting up into this big sheep.	CHITCHAT
So cool.	CHITCHAT

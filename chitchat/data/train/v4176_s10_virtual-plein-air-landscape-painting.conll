Maybe I should do something with this rock here to the right.	O
So yeah, what I do is I've been painting for awhile on this layer and I think I'll just merge merge it down now.	O
I really am only keeping that layer separate because I like to have little security blanket of being able to turn the layer on and off and see if I like it before merging so I think that's good enough.	O
We could make a new layer now and start painting on it, and paint on it for a few minutes and then merge it down so.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
I think the if I'm going to continue working big to small with the shapes.	O
I think there is something sort of calling to me next and that is the water reflection.	O
This area that I'm selecting right now.	O
This is actually sort of creating a new shape.	O
It's like a lighter lighter, Blue Purple and I think it's important to get that in so one thing you can do if you're doing reflection.	O
You can kind of color.	O
Pic from the Sky as like a starting point, 'cause that is where the reflection color is coming from make it a little bit more purple.	O
Hot.	O
So pretty I love this color.	CHITCHAT
OK, so do that and then over here on the left we can color pic from the.	O
The rock.	O
And bring that in now, I'm only going with like the starting point of the reflection.	O
I want to go in with actual paintbrush not the.	O
Not the lasso tool and hand paint.	O
Some of the really shiny parts.	O
So we need like a hard edge brush for that I think.	O
So yeah, we'll start with this and I'll just merge it down.	O
But now it feels like we're getting somewhere.	CHITCHAT
We can also work on the cloud.	O
I think I'm going to flip the canvas again.	O
Take a look from this direction.	O
The cloud is really cool.	CHITCHAT
I might switch to a brush.	O
That's a little bit more something that looks more like a natural paintbrush.	O
Something like that might be nice for cloud painting.	O
The clouds are cool shape as a nice enerji to it.	O
I'm going to pick like so one thing that I learned about painting clouds is it's nice to don't go quite for pure write a pure white right off the bat when you're painting clouds.	O
'cause if you do they have nothing left to to highlight too.	O
So this looks pretty white against the blue so we'll start with it and then that way when we go to add like the nice pop of white in the brightest parts that cloud will still have a brighter way we can go to.	O
I like the sense of movement in the cloud.	O
It seems like it's.	O
Like an explosion also part of the reason I left the these layers separate is so that I could.	O
Easily paint under the rock here behind it, so.	O
Another quick cloud painting tip, is if you choose the same or at least another textured brush for your eraser.	O
You can erase out also not just painting, but you can also use your eraser to erase back into the cloud shape and create some interesting textures, and things.	O
Hi Tim Oh, how are you?	CHITCHAT
I'm not really in love with this cloud so far.	CHITCHAT
I think part of the reason was because I got too excited about painting the little fluffy bits and it probably should have focused on the big shape like we're talking about the beginning to gesture so let's do that the gesture of the cloud is something more like this.	O
So I'll focus on that instead of getting into the full fee bits.	O
I'm sorry have a good dinner thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
And choose a different eraser.	O
There we go.	O
Need to do some cloud studies.	CHITCHAT
Hopefully this man.	CHITCHAT

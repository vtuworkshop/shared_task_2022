I think part of the problem is.	CHITCHAT
I really, really I really like clouds and I often feel like I'm not able to do them justice.	CHITCHAT
You stop streaming on Twitch Nope, I still stream on Twitch.	CHITCHAT
Alright there's also some little clouds down here.	CHITCHAT
Appear.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I think I like it a little more.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to make it smaller we can really see you can really see the difference is when you make it smaller so I'm going to focus on I'm focusing on one thing at a time with the cloud.	O
I'm not worried about the shading yet.	O
I'm just painting the sort of like treating it like a flat shape.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
We can lock the transparency pressing little button up here and then I can pick like a blue Gray and we can start bringing some shading in.	O
Timo monkey from Belgium, Oh, cool, yes, I do remember you I do remember you.	CHITCHAT
Well thanks for popping over how you been.	CHITCHAT
Right so starting to look a little bit more.	O
3D.	O
What other brushes can I try?	O
Maybe this fluffy one.	O
I recently adopted some knew.	O
Brushes so I'm kind of testing out the different different texture brushes on this cloud.	O
Get the bright white over here on the side.	O
That's working better.	O
I like how this area in the middle is gets really thin and kind of separates almost detach is to that.	O
Other little area of the cloud.	O
I don't know why it's so satisfying but.	CHITCHAT
It's really pretty.	CHITCHAT
All right and then we get the purple clouds down here more in shadow.	O
And my cloud looking at my clouds, it makes me wonder if I.	O
Have the really the right color selected for the Sky behind there.	O
I think that might be one of the reasons that.	O
The Purple Cloud looks a little funky I'm not sure.	O
So one thing I can do is check.	O
Doolittle values check and check my painting in black and white see how it looks and I can also look at the reference in black and white so here's the reference reference picture.	O
We can compare.	O
It's actually pretty good.	CHITCHAT
Sky in the reference seems a bit darker.	O
I think it seems a bit darker, yes up Top, and a bit lighter right here.	O
So, like there's a little bit more of an intense gradient.	O
The area behind the cloud is darker.	O
But it's not bad?	CHITCHAT
So I did a little shortcut to change the painting into black and white.	O
If you want to set that up for yourself, you can go to view proof setup.	O
Custom and then make sure that your proof conditions.	O

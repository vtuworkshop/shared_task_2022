The device to simulate that you select working grade gained 20% and then click OK and then every time you press control?	O
Why we have to turn your painting into black and white but the best part about it is, you can still paint in color.	O
So you can still color pick and still paint in this mode, but it's going to.	O
When you turn it back, you'll see that it's using the color that you select so it's really handy for that.	O
Hoping cute emo.	CHITCHAT
So let's let's do a little bit with the background.	O
After that little review just going to grab the.	O
Airbrush.	O
Anne will go a little bit darker behind the cloud.	O
Just because we're going darker doesn't mean to saturate more yeah that's better.	O
And then a little bit later.	O
And the edges here.	O
And that should be better.	O
Old cloud.	O
Right I'm going to go back to my cloud painting so I wasn't quite done that.	O
But I think with the Sky being.	O
Fixed.	O
It would be easier.	O
One more thing the the.	O
Rock here technically.	O
I think this should be a little bit further.	O
There's a little bit like wider of an area where we see through to the.	O
To the Sky.	O
So you can just kind of took this back here.	O
Alright now some great whites.	O
Wait, fluffy clouds.	O
Degrees out.	O
You want those little tiny light.	O
Mini tendrils that are drifting away from the rest of the cloud.	O
So painting in a racing out.	O
Just very, very lightly would be nice for that.	O
I'm going to flip and take a look from this direction.	O
I think I like it.	CHITCHAT
Going to go to.	O
Warped.	O
Open that up a little bit.	O
One thing that I noticed a little bit in painting clouds is there's often one edge that's kind of harder.	O
And then the cloud sorted dissolves away a little bit.	O
So it's not necessarily a problem to use a hard brush.	O
Old friend, the style your painting in you can basically do whatever you want.	O
There's a lot of room for creativity but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can have one edge that's a little harder and then have to.	O
The cloud kind of dissolve away out of that little bit.	O
Alright I think I fiddled with the cloud enough for now, we're just going to.	O
Move on and if we have time to go back to it, and mess around some more, we can.	O
Thing that's OK.	O
So I'm going to grab one of my brushes that I use for blocking in just a rectangle brush that has.	O
A little bit of texture to it, and start working on the rocks on the left.	O

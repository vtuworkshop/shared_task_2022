It can make a new layer go to right click create clipping mask and.	O
I think it would be nice to keep it on a separate layer just so that I can make sure I like what I'm doing.	O
After adding new things and then we'll just merge down if we like it.	O
But if you have any questions, you're welcome, you're welcome to ask me.	CHITCHAT
Just kind of selecting some different hues, as I go through to add this striping.	O
Hi Fabio, thank you.	CHITCHAT
Kind of cool there's this line up here.	O
It's like.	CHITCHAT
This is a shadow.	O
Around the rim of the Top of the Canyon.	O
It's just all these interesting striping effects created.	O
All the way back here there's a little shadow, pointing down.	O
He seems really challenging it is there's a lot in it.	CHITCHAT
I really like I really like this reference.	CHITCHAT
But it's a bit, it doesn't seem like there's so much in it.	CHITCHAT
At first glance 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I feel like the point of view is like your kind of aimed down at the ground.	O
Or it's a sort of worm's eye view looking up from the ground.	O
I should say and.	O
But there is really a lot of rocks and a lot of things going on.	O
But if anybody wants to see the reference.	O
I uploaded the image so it is a.	O
Below the stream you should be able to find it if you're curious.	CHITCHAT
It's from.	O
Google Maps Street View.	O
I found it through a website calledmapcrunch.com that I like to use to hunt for Virtual Plein air painting reference images.	O
It's pretty fun.	CHITCHAT
It's actually easy to get addicted to that website.	CHITCHAT
It's very silly, but I like to click through there, you can click click go and just get like knew random places and it's really nice to use for painting reference practice and things.	CHITCHAT
Sorry I'll merge that down and then make a new layer 'cause I kind of like how that went.	O
And I think it's time to bring some of the highlights in on the left.	O
I think that's going to give a lot more shape the reference.	O
I have to admit the references a little bit overexposed.	O
In some places.	O
I still am using it anyway.	CHITCHAT
'cause it's just such a pretty scene that I decided to put up with that often times with the references really overexposed then I won't want to use it.	CHITCHAT
But in this case.	CHITCHAT
I was like Oh well, I was going to do it.	CHITCHAT
It's hard to see what's going on in some areas in the reference on the left, but I think we get enough information to work from to make this happen.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
There's a rock coming down like this.	O
Just going to kind of sketch in with bright.	O
Color here.	O
Also I'm going to flip the canvas because I think I need a little fresh view.	O
What's going on over here?	CHITCHAT
It helps.	CHITCHAT
So we get some layers.	O
Oh my goodness, I don't know if you guys hear that noise outside making noise.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
This rock is facing towards the light so it's getting lot of brightly on it.	O
I'm going to use the lasso tool to make some selections an paint this in the same way that I painted the rest of the rocks otherwise.	O
I don't think it's going to look very cohesive.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
You hurted like what's going on over there is driving through the neck of his racing through the neighborhood, I should say.	CHITCHAT

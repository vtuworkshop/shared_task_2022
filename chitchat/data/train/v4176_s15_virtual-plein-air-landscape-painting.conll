This is going to be a tricky one.	O
I may have to zoom in so I haven't been zooming in on my reference.	O
I have it open on my other monitor a little bit bigger than what you see up here is the thumbnail of course, but I'm just going to zoom in so I can work on this rock and properly.	CHITCHAT
But I'd like to hold off on zooming in until I get to the end to get to the really detailed parts as I find if I zoom in too.	O
Quick I get sucked in get sucked into details and I lose the whole scene.	CHITCHAT
This is if I'm doing well.	CHITCHAT
Honestly, this is true for how I paint in general, but it's especially true for fun doing like a time painting that I don't want to really don't want to get sucked in.	CHITCHAT
But even if I'm doing just a regular illustration, you still want to keep like the whole.	CHITCHAT
Seen in your mind.	CHITCHAT
I do have a navigator window open.	CHITCHAT
You can always go to window Navigator and then open this little mini window, which kind of gives you like a thumbnail view.	CHITCHAT
I usually have that open on my other monitor just in case.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
Can look up at that.	CHITCHAT
See what things look like if.	CHITCHAT
Resumed in Oops color.	CHITCHAT
All right.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to keep that rock on its own layer for a little bit more.	O
I want to do some more work behind it.	O
So it's easier, that way.	O
There's going to be some other rocks, a whole bunch of am actually that pop up over here.	O
Kind of come towards us this is actually something that I've been trying to workout.	O
I do a lot of landscape sketching and.	CHITCHAT
I really want to find a way to illustrate this type of rock more quickly like all these like River rocks.	CHITCHAT
These smooth small rocks that have all different shapes, but they're kind of rounded or smoothed out flat different different shapes and it seems just it's always so time consuming to paint them.	CHITCHAT
I've never been able to find like a quick way.	CHITCHAT
To illustrate them at least if I'm going for a certain level of finish then I get stuck painting these rocks individually and.	CHITCHAT
You know if you are if you're going to take a very painterly approach.	CHITCHAT
The whole scene.	CHITCHAT
Then you can do that.	CHITCHAT
With the rocks too.	CHITCHAT
But if I just come in here now and start painting.	CHITCHAT
The rocks really loose.	CHITCHAT
They're just going to look bad compared to the rest of seen that part looks nightmarish.	CHITCHAT
I know there's so many rocks.	CHITCHAT
This is what I'm like why did I pick this reference but it's so pretty?	CHITCHAT
But there's like a million rocks over here, it will have to figure well to figure that one out.	CHITCHAT
That's something where I thought about using like the?	O
The mixer brush I thought that would be kind of cool.	O
You could do the Bob Ross technique where you like you get the light color on Top dark color on the bottom of the brush and just one stroke and your River rocks boom boom boom super fast.	O
But I I still haven't.	O
Managed to to get them managed to get that whole mixer brush thing down yet so.	O
Boo.	CHITCHAT
OK, well, I think I will.	CHITCHAT
Almost merge down let's see.	O
Grab the airbrush there's a little reflection under the rock little shadow.	O
All right.	O
Let's see at 7:30 alright we're doing OK there's a lot left.	CHITCHAT
But but I'm liking it.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to take a break from this area, so I'm kind of a little bit working Top down.	O
I guess as getting getting closer to us going to take a break from that left side an work on the big rock on the right and then we'll kind of pull it all together, I hope.	O
That's the plan.	CHITCHAT
Art new layer.	O

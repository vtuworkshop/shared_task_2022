Going to make a selection.	O
And get this whole big rock in there.	O
Not the whole rock, but the area that I want to highlight.	O
And we're just going to.	O
Take that late light blue that we're seeing in the Sky water.	O
Start with that, we can also use brush that has texture.	O
Oops.	CHITCHAT
This is really pretty the rock itself had a lot of looks like it has a lot of texture and detail like little little dots.	O
And then on Top of that late is reflecting on it, so.	O
Honestly, we could spend a lot of time on this rock if we wanted to.	CHITCHAT
But we don't want to.	CHITCHAT
We just want to get the Gist of it.	O
So it has almost like a little foot that comes out.	O
This little little piece comes out?	O
Kind of Balanced on there seems better.	O
Alright time to flip.	O
Alright that's not too bad.	O
Anymore.	O
Shadow underneath.	O
And this starts over here.	O
So there's a lot of rocks on the ground here, too, but they are so small and kind of a further away from us.	O
So I think we'll be able to kind of hint at them with a texture instead of drawing individual rocks, so that's ideal.	O
A little highlight back here.	O
Try to get that perfect brush stroke only move on to a new layer.	O
For it.	O
Little later Pinker.	O
There you go.	O
Mill says do you ever look at a reference and get so confused it makes your head hurt trying to figure out?	CHITCHAT
What is there?	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I have experienced that definitely definitely.	CHITCHAT
So if you get stuck with one of those there's a couple tricks you can use.	CHITCHAT
I've heard people so one things that have been recommended to me before that.	CHITCHAT
I don't really love to do, but is too like Squint Your Eyes and look at the reference.	CHITCHAT
I don't really love to do that 'cause I actually get a headache from it pretty easily but.	CHITCHAT
The idea is like you know to kind of really, really simplify it that way.	CHITCHAT
But you can also like apply blur filters and stuff.	O
So, like you can go to filter blur.	O
You know, there's all different kinds of blurs you can choose.	O
But put in a little bit of a blur it starts to.	O
Simplify the composition a little bit.	O
You can.	CHITCHAT
Looking at in black-and-white sometimes helps that like taking away elements.	O
And trying to break it down to the most simple thing.	O
But yeah, definitely.	O

And just remember you don't have to include everything I mean, unless you're doing a Commission work and the people that comparison, commissioning you has wants a specific elements to be in the artwork.	CHITCHAT
You know if you're just painting a landscape and you feel overwhelmed by it.	CHITCHAT
You know as the artist.	CHITCHAT
I think you can make some decisions.	CHITCHAT
You're allowed to say you're allowed to decide that maybe in areas too busy and it would be it would be better if it was.	CHITCHAT
If you left some things out.	CHITCHAT
And stuff like that of course, then you have to make decisions on what's going to be changed and that can be tough, but Sometimes I would even draw on a reference image and kind of paint over it and block out stuff or change things on the reference.	CHITCHAT
So that you don't get confused from it when you buy it when you're working.	CHITCHAT
Some I'm going to grab the Airbrush and do a little bit more over here on the left.	O
This rock has some nice soft.	O
Shadows.	O
All those rocks, So what are we going to do?	O
Well, I think what I'm 1st going to do is get rid of what I have here that's That's a bunch of nonsense.	O
Wanna start over?	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
I just gotta try stuff I don't know I like I said, I have had a hard time figuring out.	O
Up.	O
How to indicate this kind of texture easily quickly and easily?	O
I'm just going to try making some shapes some dark shapes 'cause I like to do dark to light simplify.	O
Have minimize the amount of stuff I have to paint sometimes so I'm just going to make some shapes down here.	O
And then we'll try making later shapes on Top and see if that works.	O
Temaki Valley how are you?	CHITCHAT
Thanks for coming.	CHITCHAT
We're doing a?	CHITCHAT
Desert virtual plain error.	CHITCHAT
The reference is under the Stream if you want to take a look.	CHITCHAT
But right now, I'm trying to figure out what to do with these rocks.	CHITCHAT
Mill says I see working moving around the peace a lot.	CHITCHAT
How do you know when it's time to move to a different part of the painting without getting too stuck on one part.	CHITCHAT
I kind of there's a couple things I used to determine that one is I kind of go with the flow so as long as I'm working in an area and things are going well.	O
I keep working there.	O
When I start to hit a brick wall.	O
and I really feel stuck and I've tried a couple solutions to the area and it's not working then I just leave.	O
It usually and I'll work somewhere else.	O
It's not quite as good as like you know, sometimes I have to take a step away from the painting and then come back with fresh eyes.	O
It's a little bit of a like a mini version of that within your own painting.	O
Just work on another area and then you can come back an see if it starts making more sense to you 'cause sometimes it does.	O
Sometimes it's easier than another thing is I don't usually like to.	O
Work so that one area the painting is like looks perfect in the other area.	O
There's nothing going on.	O
This painting isn't a great example of that 'cause be honest.	O
I have worked that way.	O
A little bit here where the foreground has very little going on an appears much more rendered so.	O
There's exceptions to everything but usually I like to kind of work around the scene and I did it up here.	O
You know, we worked on the cloud.	O
A little bit.	O
We worked on this side work and that side and we bounced around 'cause.	O
I like to work on the whole scene and kind of try to bring it towards being finished.	O
Um simultaneously.	O
That way you have a better grip on how the values like the shading and the colors in the scene relate to one another and you don't get stuck like.	O

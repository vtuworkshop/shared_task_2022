Trying to figure out those relationships near the end or like force them if they're not working.	O
So I'm going to start to work on the foreground now and this is going to be tricky, so this is one of the things that made me choose to paint this reference.	O
'cause I wanted to figure out how to paint this kind of situation.	O
The rushing water in the foreground kind of coming towards us and the ripples that it creates an the little bubbles and all that kind of stuff.	O
So I hope I can achieve that feeling of the water is really moving there.	O
Might give some inspiration alright let's see got an artstation link.	O
Oh, cool.	CHITCHAT
Good vibes good vibes.	CHITCHAT
Other desert desert scene.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's always really satisfying the color combination in these kind of desert scenes, the nice blue Sky and like the Warm Reds and oranges.	O
I like the one I'm working on 2 'cause.	O
It's like you get the extra bonus of like some purple thrown in there and that's just perfect.	O
For me.	O
Yeah, that's cool thanks.	CHITCHAT
Team I says, I was looking for a nice location on map French and I found this alright.	CHITCHAT
I'm ready for some dog like with half his body has been overlapped by a boat.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes the image stitching just has some weird stuff that happens, Oh team.	CHITCHAT
Oh, if you want to share a link for map crunch.	CHITCHAT
You have to click the share button and then copy the link that is there if you copy the link from the URL above it's not going to send the right image.	CHITCHAT
So what you can do is click right here where it says share and then copy this.	CHITCHAT
And then that will be the right one, 'cause I think it sent the wrong one from you.	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
Alright cool.	CHITCHAT
Will get back to painting?	CHITCHAT
OK, so these so right now, I'm just going to start with a darker shadows.	O
Of where I see the ripples.	O
I'm not worried about putting like every ripple in the right spot.	O
But we couldn't get the overall feel this.	O
Some more Brown here.	O
Alright that should work this time.	O
What's wrong with that picture?	CHITCHAT
Does actually seems nice?	CHITCHAT
I don't see anything wrong with that landscape Timo?	CHITCHAT
When you when you're using map crunch you're going to get a lot of like side of the road road views because you know if you think about where the car is going.	CHITCHAT
Order fact that it's your in the Google Maps.	CHITCHAT
People are in a car traveling there, you get a lot of side of the road like kind of bland images, but then you also get like the most amazing pictures and people also upload images and stuff, I think that might be.	CHITCHAT
You know where some of the really, really fantastic ones come from.	CHITCHAT
But people will be on the boat on foot.	CHITCHAT
You know, I've seen people like riding camels and stuff, he's taking pictures for Google.	CHITCHAT
Maps years was a fitness studio, yeah, there's all kinds of stuff.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, but sometimes you get something weird because the 3D or the 360 Panorama.	CHITCHAT
View is created by them stitching images together.	CHITCHAT
So, sometimes you have weird situations where stuff overlaps.	CHITCHAT
Images don't line up quite right and I'll be like.	CHITCHAT
Weird stuff happens, but	CHITCHAT
I've painted with references with stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
You just kind of leave so weird parts out and just do your thing.	CHITCHAT
There's a little bit of a reflection over here that I think it's time I can get that in now.	O
I'm getting into more detail stuff.	O
Reflection in the water.	O
The reference is really beautiful thanks monkey.	CHITCHAT

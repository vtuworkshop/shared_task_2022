Belly, I thought so too I'm glad you like it.	CHITCHAT
Better hurry up so I have time to paint the greens and stuffing that extra little bit of foliage at the end is going to be really nice.	O
So there's some little rocks and pebbles and stuff here just going to sketch in some.	O
Scribbling some details.	O
How much time is left?	CHITCHAT
It's 746.	CHITCHAT
And I probably will end around 9:15.	CHITCHAT
So we have a bit of time left.	CHITCHAT
Merge this down knew layer.	O
And let's make a selection of this rock.	O
There's one more rock over here that I think would be nice to include.	O
Plenty of time for shiny parts?	CHITCHAT
Yeah.	CHITCHAT
We have plenty of time to add.	O
A fun little finishing details and things.	O
How's The Light?	CHITCHAT
I can turn the light down a little bit.	CHITCHAT
Sorry guys reaching over my tablet here.	CHITCHAT
Delighted the Suns going down outside so it's making the lighting pretty intense from my desk lamp now.	CHITCHAT
I think that's better.	CHITCHAT
OK emerged that dumb and go to the next thing so recently.	O
I painted some metal textures, and it gave me an idea even though this is not metal.	CHITCHAT
This is water.	CHITCHAT
Sometimes there are some similar things with like metal water glass?	O
How they reflect in some situations.	O
So Long story short, I used the smudge brush a little bit in painting.	O
Some textures recently.	O
and I think I can kind of try a similar technique here, even though it's a different subject.	O
Think I cannot try that.	CHITCHAT
Thank you crazy thank you very much.	CHITCHAT
So if he turned the smudge brush up to a really high percentage.	O
Sometimes it can really distort things a lot, which might be cool.	O
If we want this like rushing water rippled texture effect.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I think that could be cool and I really know if that.	O
Alright so here's my idea going to test this out idea is I'm going to paint in a bunch of highlights roughly where they need to be shadows roughly where they need to be that kind of thing and then we're going to use the smudge brush to kind of like.	O
Smash it together and try to see if we can make a cool effect.	O
So it's almost like if we imagine this is traditional paint them like just going to put just going to drop some paint on the canvas right now and then we're going to.	O
Smudge it around.	O
Once it's on there, so I don't know how that's going to go but.	CHITCHAT
Might be a total failure, but these kind of studies are fun to experiment with that stuff because.	CHITCHAT
Why not?	CHITCHAT
It's just a?	CHITCHAT
It's a time study after this is done and it's this of no real consequences.	CHITCHAT
So if something doesn't go well.	CHITCHAT
It's not a big problem.	CHITCHAT
And I will also do the same thing with shadows.	O
Can put some?	O
Random colors OK merge that down.	O

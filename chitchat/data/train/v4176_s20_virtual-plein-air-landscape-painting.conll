Let's just see what happens.	O
So I'm just kind of dabbing this much brush down lately.	O
Honestly can't tell if this is doing anything I don't.	O
I don't think it's working.	O
But let's not let's not speak too soon flip it over.	O
Actually, I think it could be kind of the start to something.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
And grab a different brush.	O
So I think one thing that's important is that we get the feeling of the water like rushing away or rushing down here so.	O
Maybe a brush stroke that kind of makes it look very speedy.	O
I see the paint stroke.	O
That could work.	O
I think when we add the foam of the water, the little white bits.	O
They're getting turned up, I think that's going to help, too, but that's kind of like a detail that I feel like I have to go on the Top after we get the rest of it in.	O
All thanks Mills.	CHITCHAT
Even though the greenery is missing still looks cool thanks.	O
I think with a desert scene.	O
You could even get away with kind of like skipping out on that stuff because I think it feels finished enough.	O
Just having like the warms warms and cool combinations like even without the green.	O
I think there's enough for it to work.	O
But if we have time and I think we will.	O
Could be nice to pop pop them in there?	O
But I'm glad to hear that it's seems to be working, even without them.	O
Miss switch to a flat brush and.	O
We have some braids blue.	O
Highlights in the water.	O
Maybe even more bright than we already have there and then.	O
I think the cloud is reflecting in the water, too because suddenly we have.	O
Like almost a warm color like a white.	O
Reflecting.	O
I wonder if I should use the?	CHITCHAT
I'm going to race out what I just did.	O
I'm going to try using the Airbrush and the lasso for this because it's so glassy smooth in the reference that I think my hand painting isn't getting the right effect.	O
So I'm just going to select a couple like ripples like this.	O
Grab the Airbrush and.	O
Paint in We control age to hide the?	O
Little dots.	O
Maybe something like that.	O
Can deselect and erase in and modify it now but I think this is a better start than what I was getting for.	O
I want these ripples to come down an?	O
Kind of they kind of turn into all this nonsense like it needs to become.	O
Become one, it's all part of the water right now.	O
It doesn't feel unified.	O
Pick a little darker color purple.	O
For the Some of these ripples.	O
I'm turning up the water.	O
And merge that down so.	O

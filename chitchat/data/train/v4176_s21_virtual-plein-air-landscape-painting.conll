It is a little bit of progress.	O
There's a rock here, too.	O
Right here, but I don't know that I'm going to include it.	O
I think it's maybe OK without it, so time to work on this last little corner over here.	O
That doesn't really have anything going on at the moment, it's going to have reflection.	O
So when I color pic from the Top left.	O
Wall and use that as a starting point for the reflection color 'cause that's where the light is coming from.	O
Just kind of paint in some ripples here.	O
Maybe I could even use like overlay or color, Dodge or something on my brush might be nice to have sort of a?	O
Saturating effect, which would be nice overlay.	O
Can use the smudge brush to blend some of this and leave other things sharp?	O
Yeah, I really I like having you guys here and you're welcome to ask questions and stuff but.	CHITCHAT
It's also.	CHITCHAT
We're making some good progress on the painting and getting a chance to.	CHITCHAT
Really getting the stone here.	CHITCHAT
Oh, what did you find out IMO?	CHITCHAT
I'm scared whenever people link me random stuff in map crunch?	CHITCHAT
I'm like?	CHITCHAT
Wondering what kind of weird stuff is found it supposed to be you know, Google supposed to remove any.	CHITCHAT
Anything too weird tickets up there, but	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
That's beautiful, Oh, I thought it made your emoji is the surprise face OK for me.	CHITCHAT
I thought it was like a scared face.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, wow.	CHITCHAT
That's a really nice scene here.	CHITCHAT
Let me show you guys what temo found.	CHITCHAT
It looks like it's from like fantasy movie or something.	CHITCHAT
It's really nice is like a bit overexposed.	CHITCHAT
This happens, a lot, but it's still nice.	CHITCHAT
Hi Pokey, thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
Welcome.	CHITCHAT
If anybody has any questions, you guys can let me know.	CHITCHAT
But I'm doing a virtual Plein Air Painting.	CHITCHAT
It's a place called Fry Canyon.	CHITCHAT
In Utah and it's so pretty.	CHITCHAT
I haven't been there in person.	CHITCHAT
But he found this image on map crunch.	CHITCHAT
Which takes images from Google Street View?	CHITCHAT
And I like to do landscape studies from.	CHITCHAT
From the references that we find there.	CHITCHAT
And if you want to take a look at the reference.	CHITCHAT
It's blow the stream.	CHITCHAT
There's a link.	CHITCHAT
I just made a screenshot so it's the same thing I'm looking at and.	CHITCHAT
Bears.	CHITCHAT
If you like it and you want to.	CHITCHAT
Do a little study, or anything, you guys are welcome to take the reference and.	CHITCHAT
Try it out.	CHITCHAT
Complete with me.	CHITCHAT
I wonder if I push that pink a little too far right there.	O
I don't really at this stage want to bring in a lot of colors or really don't want to bring any colors that don't already exist in the scene.	O
Just kind of want to stick to the pilot we have.	O
Alright merge that down.	O
Going to make a new layer fill it with black and put that on color Dodge mode.	O

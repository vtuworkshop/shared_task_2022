Want to do a little.	O
Boost to the the lighting over here.	O
Oh, thank you so much pookie looks very nice.	CHITCHAT
My favorite thing to practice lately has been doing virtual Plein air painting and it really changed a lot of things for me.	CHITCHAT
Got me to practice a lot of different types of scenes and things that I.	CHITCHAT
Was kind of avoiding before?	CHITCHAT
So I've been going to enjoy my painting more.	CHITCHAT
Getting out of my comfort zone.	CHITCHAT
Right so I think I like the extra little glow.	CHITCHAT
That makes me happy.	CHITCHAT
To make a new layer and put it on overlay, an kind of do similar type of thing.	O
Spring a little bit of later.	O
Purple glow to the left side.	O
Just for some more atmospheric effects.	O
2 pink to pink.	O
There we go it's better.	O
I really like the warm cool contrast, so I want to boost that up a bit.	O
Alright emerge that down so now we see starting to see bigger difference this year.	O
OK, now, what to do with this water everything surrounding is starting to come together so.	O
Here we go.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to grab that actually let's try this brush.	O
And there's a lot of ripples and things.	O
So I think I'm I mean, you don't you guys if you.	CHITCHAT
Wash my painting process before even just listening to me now.	CHITCHAT
You know it's I really try to find like the efficient way of painting things.	CHITCHAT
But sometimes there certain types of textures that you really just have to actually get in there and paint it.	CHITCHAT
There's not so much of a shortcut to certain things you know.	O
Released I haven't found it and this water ripples.	O
I think I'm just going to get in here and paint.	O
This sometimes it doesn't even take as long as you think and you're just making a big deal out of it 'cause I'm being lazy, but	CHITCHAT
Lazy efficient kind of.	CHITCHAT
Debatable.	CHITCHAT
Daisy says a big issue.	CHITCHAT
I have is I don't really paint with intent and make strokes and hope it looks good.	O
I mean, I understand I think I think at some point we all like it's easy to kind of go into that autopilot mode where you're just you're just painting just doing your thing kind of getting his own.	CHITCHAT
You kind of get into like a meditative state.	CHITCHAT
That's part of the reason that I started doing that I'm studies because when I have a timer on I am less likely to do that.	CHITCHAT
I'm more intentional with each of the strokes that I make 'cause I kinda have that idea in my head that it's like.	CHITCHAT
I have to finish this you know, I have a timer on and I'm looking at it on my go have?	CHITCHAT
You know 30 minutes left or whatever I have to.	CHITCHAT
What can I do real quick to make this?	CHITCHAT
Work.	CHITCHAT
An after doing a lot of studies with that mindset, I notice that started per meeting.	CHITCHAT
My painting process, even when I wasn't.	CHITCHAT
Even when I wasn't using a timer.	CHITCHAT
It just started changing the way that I was thinking.	CHITCHAT
When I was painting, so and that makes sense 'cause it's like.	CHITCHAT
You know if you're an athlete or musician any type of practice that you're doing like when you're practicing its practicing for when you're going to have some kind of.	CHITCHAT
Like a performance or something uh game we're going to have to rely on like the instincts that you form and so I think it's like that with painting to like by doing these kinds of studies.	CHITCHAT
It helps me it helped us change my mindset so even when I'm painting something that isn't.	CHITCHAT
Timed I feel like I'm just a little bit more present with it.	CHITCHAT
Because I am in my head.	CHITCHAT
I'm like I don't know I'm just being being more aware what time I'm spending on what?	CHITCHAT

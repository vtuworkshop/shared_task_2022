Look at me, I'm painting all the way here in the distance when Meanwhile, foreground is being neglected.	O
All right.	CHITCHAT
Here we go new layer let's get back to it.	O
There's some shines here.	O
Reflections from the left.	O
You need to remember that, yeah, I mean, it, I hope it helps a little bit.	CHITCHAT
I might I think it would help you know when you're doing the study is when you're doing stuff your art club and things like that.	CHITCHAT
Just you don't even have to be restricting your time necessarily but like for example, if you're going to sit down for a drawing session.	CHITCHAT
You could just say like I only have like an hour or 2 to paint today and just kind of like notice what you're doing in that time it doesn't mean that you have to do everything is timed and you can only.	CHITCHAT
To get this long in every piece, which is being aware of what time you're spending on stuff is good bless.	CHITCHAT
It's useful later when you are doing Commission or something maybe?	CHITCHAT
And people ask how long it's going to take to do something.	CHITCHAT
If you if you've done some timed studies in time to work.	CHITCHAT
I don't know it starts giving you a better idea of what you can do in certain amounts of time.	CHITCHAT
Pokey says I like to create portraits and I never really pay attention to backgrounds.	CHITCHAT
But it's definitely something I want to learn any suggestions on how to start yes.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh.	CHITCHAT
I was the same, like I loved painting people.	CHITCHAT
An I did a lot of character portraits and things and I never I always put like an abstract background behind them or like something blurred out 'cause I didn't want to deal with it, but	CHITCHAT
If you like what I'm doing here if you.	CHITCHAT
If this kind of thing interests, you, it's called I would look into virtual Plein Air Painting.	CHITCHAT
I know I'm always trying to sell people on doing this, but it's like been the most helpful thing for my art and I really enjoy doing it, but basically the idea that you're like, Plein air painting is like going outside and painting like in the field and virtual plein.	CHITCHAT
Air is like your painting from an image of the outdoors and generally people use images from Google Street View and things like that, so I do.	CHITCHAT
I do a lot of paintings of scenes from?	CHITCHAT
Likemapcrunch.com, where you can get random images select random images and stuff, and do little study.	CHITCHAT
From there doing time.	CHITCHAT
Studies is really nice.	CHITCHAT
Because you get a lot of benefit for the amount of time that you're going to be working on something.	CHITCHAT
Most of what you're going to learn in doing a study or a lot of what you're going to learn doing a study is going to come from?	CHITCHAT
The first like couple hours that you're working on it, and after that.	CHITCHAT
You kind of just like texturing and tweaking and doing a lot of little things.	CHITCHAT
But the most important information is coming from like the initial composition and block in and everything like that.	CHITCHAT
But you're doing so, if you do, do some shorter studies take a reference and do.	CHITCHAT
Here let me show you for example, in my artstation.	CHITCHAT
Some of the past ones, and these are a little older now because.	CHITCHAT
Well, they're not super old but I need to upload some more recent ones.	CHITCHAT
But let me.	CHITCHAT
Let me show you examples.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
These are just some examples of past paintings and these I've spent a little bit longer on like up to a couple hours like 3 hours.	CHITCHAT
I think I usually will spend like an hour, an hour and 15 minutes on them and they've gotten a lot better.	CHITCHAT
I don't have my very early ones online or I would show you but let's go to the earliest ones that I did upload here.	CHITCHAT
Some of the earlier ones so you can see.	CHITCHAT
Example these.	CHITCHAT
They're a little bit more rough.	CHITCHAT
And these are just from little bit longer ago.	CHITCHAT
So.	CHITCHAT
OK, I'm just catching up in the check those off on the tangent there, but basically so Long story short.	CHITCHAT

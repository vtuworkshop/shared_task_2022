You can do.	CHITCHAT
Some studies image studies where you just don't spend too long on it, and like I would set a goal to maybe do 5.	CHITCHAT
Like paint paint 5 landscape pictures that you like and maybe spend like a maximum of 2 hours on each one so that's 10 hours of painting an I think you're going to learn a ton in that time about lighting and.	CHITCHAT
And you can set it up, however you want.	CHITCHAT
That's just like one example of a way you can start to get a feel for things.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, this is cool, but I think this kind of stuff is good like fasy.	CHITCHAT
This is phase artwork that she just shared and I think this kind of setting is good for like a character like this.	CHITCHAT
You don't really need to have a crazy background.	CHITCHAT
It would maybe distract from the character and the characters taking up almost all of the frame anyway.	CHITCHAT
So if you try to have a busy background.	CHITCHAT
It would be really confusing to look at so.	CHITCHAT
That's a thing sometimes portraits, it's better to keep it simple.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like that I like that crazy.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, Pokey you're welcome also, if you you know if you ever want to like if you come by the stream here.	CHITCHAT

I share under the.	CHITCHAT
Under the stream and You know draw paint that if you like.	CHITCHAT
Paint paint along.	CHITCHAT
But it's really hard to start painting backgrounds to your characters when you don't have some kind of foundation environment paid thing I think.	CHITCHAT
And you don't have to go crazy, but just a little just little Plein Air Painting Practice is really fun.	CHITCHAT

Crazy so sometimes you're just out of the Zone 2 hours later this is my result.	CHITCHAT
I'll come on are busy this is nice.	CHITCHAT
It is not a disaster.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think honestly to me, this is would be one of my favorite times to like begin working on a painting 'cause you already have, like the hard stuff figured out you already figured out the proportions.	CHITCHAT
The everything is in so now you're just going to go in there and do some rendering is going to be nice.	CHITCHAT
This is just this is just a classic example of a painting that is in like the early stages, so of course, it's going to look a little wonky because.	CHITCHAT
There's a lot there's a lot of work left to be done.	CHITCHAT
This is just this is just a work in progress.	CHITCHAT
You're fine just gotta keep going just gotta keep going.	CHITCHAT

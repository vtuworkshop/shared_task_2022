I didn't know that or maybe I didn't remember if you told me that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, we are getting close to the time last year when I vary.	CHITCHAT
So you must have found it found me really early 'cause I started posting gouache paintings in November.	CHITCHAT
So holy cow that's awesome.	CHITCHAT
Thank you Mary but I hated it that day, OK, I understand.	CHITCHAT
We have, we have those moments with art.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
Oh yeah that's what I was going to like what am I doing fun part.	CHITCHAT
We can patient long enough.	CHITCHAT
So I'm going to pick a light blue but it's all relative OK look at that.	O
That's not even is way too bright.	O
I'm going to color pic from this up here and just go a little bit later, little bit more blue.	O
OK, maybe a little bit.	O
Lighter.	O
So I want to use this as the color for the little bubbles in the water.	O
There's like little bubbles, trailing around the edge the water is getting turned up.	O
I know right time is going by that's OK.	O
We're still doing good.	O
We're still doing good not time to panic, yet.	CHITCHAT
At the time I was falling in love with Gouache Environment Studies.	CHITCHAT
But I didn't realize that you stream until this year.	CHITCHAT
Oh, OK, OK cool.	CHITCHAT
I'm going to flip the canvas.	O
I think it's easier.	O
Sometimes I flip just to make paint strokes depending on it's easier for my right handed to do certain types of strokes, so yeah, I think for these little quick ones.	O
This is easier and then there's all these little.	O
Foamy bubbles.	O
And ripples and things.	O
This may be the first time I've seen it get dark at Maddys.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, look at that it's getting really dark in this room.	CHITCHAT
We can.	CHITCHAT
Let's see.	CHITCHAT
I can put on some fancy lighting for us.	CHITCHAT
What do you think?	CHITCHAT
What color?	CHITCHAT
Purple red.	CHITCHAT
What is the hardest thing for you to draw everyone ooh for me it's?	CHITCHAT
Very technical stuff like if I were to draw like a car or weapons or something that's like has a lot of technical moving parts and there's a lot of' perspective and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
That would be really tough for me, then I would feel like.	CHITCHAT
I don't think I would enjoy that too much.	CHITCHAT
If I had to be like super precise with it if I could be kind of painterly with it and just kind of.	CHITCHAT
Sketch it and have fun maybe maybe would be OK but.	CHITCHAT
That's not really my Forte.	CHITCHAT
I love painting natural things.	CHITCHAT
So I think that organic natural scenes have a lot of organic shapes and things that can be.	CHITCHAT
Can be?	CHITCHAT
A little bit imperfect an it's not so problematic.	CHITCHAT
I believe Mattie can painted Gundham Easilly, Oh my gosh well.	CHITCHAT
Thank you for believing in me.	CHITCHAT
I'll take it, I don't know that I agree with that, but I appreciate the vote of confidence.	CHITCHAT
Man this is getting very busy this painting.	CHITCHAT
Monkey village was capturing a likeness in someone's lips is Deceivingly.	CHITCHAT
Hard yes and the Anna knows just just painting like this is hard.	CHITCHAT
That's definitely true.	CHITCHAT
And lips and noses.	CHITCHAT
And stuff.	CHITCHAT
Needs a texture brush for this area with a bunch of rocks.	O

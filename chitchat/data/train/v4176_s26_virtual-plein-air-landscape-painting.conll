Painting guys is hard free Pokey Yeah, I I have a lot more experience painting ladies.	CHITCHAT
Just 'cause I always liked to do it, so that makes it easier for me than painting male characters.	CHITCHAT
I think that's just always the case like whatever you like to paint becomes easier for you 'cause you just do it more you enjoy a more you're willing to put in the time you don't mind the stuff that you don't like.	CHITCHAT
You just avoid it, and it gets you want to do it less and less.	CHITCHAT

Mill says the way you did, the water in the foreground with the ripples could the same technique be applied to the small River rocks in the reference.	CHITCHAT
Possibly.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think kind of in the sense that I need to just get in there and paint it.	CHITCHAT

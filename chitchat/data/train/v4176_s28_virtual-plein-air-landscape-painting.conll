Merge that down.	O
You should have a teal background.	O
Kay Ikaw teal.	O
It's not like super strong not super bright but.	O
That's what I got for you.	O
I have a 3DS we U stylus that looks like the.	O
LOZ master sword Legend of Zelda.	CHITCHAT
All that so cute Oh my God, I love that.	CHITCHAT
Going to paint some more.	O
Brate reflections.	O
I think we need some warmer.	O
Yellow now so we've got the blue.	O
Baby Oh.	CHITCHAT
Well, it happens to me pretty quick, too, so I understand.	CHITCHAT
Oh, I don't think that link is going to work Pokey.	CHITCHAT
It did you upload that somewhere it looks like it's going to?	CHITCHAT
Before dance I can try control.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I think you need to put a URL in there that we can.	CHITCHAT
That we cannot click on.	CHITCHAT
You know, I'm starting to think that those rocks on the left.	O
Maybe aren't so important like so far.	O
It's not really.	O
I don't think they're really missing anything that the rocks aren't there So what I'm going to do is.	O
I'm going to include some of them under in this shadow kinda area here.	O
But I think it's going to be OK for us not to like include every rock or like the full number that are there?	O
Thank you lighting technician.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, you can leave him out, I thought so.	CHITCHAT
Like it feels very complete without them and it might draw a lot of attention over to that area so.	O
I'm OK with it.	O
But I do think I need to switch out some of these.	O
Things.	O
Maybe put some more detail.	O
'Cause the rocks have these little the look that it's kind of worn or the little areas like chipping off of the rock.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad to get approved of my idea.	CHITCHAT
So I was thinking if I make a new layer I can pick.	O
You know, maybe maybe a couple of rocks to paint in.	O
And then that's it.	O
Almost time for the greenery that's right.	O

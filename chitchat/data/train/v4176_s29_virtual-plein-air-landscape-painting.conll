Looking forward to that.	CHITCHAT
I just enjoy painting foliage of all kinds of subject matters.	CHITCHAT
I find the.	CHITCHAT
It's relaxing to paint I didn't always feel this way.	CHITCHAT
When I was inexperienced that I would feel very overwhelmed painting it because it can have a lot of detail but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I found some brushes that I like to use.	CHITCHAT
Then it's not dependent on the brushes, but using texture brushes can give a nice boost the foliage without having to spend a million.	CHITCHAT
Years painting it.	CHITCHAT
I don't necessarily like using brushes that are intended specifically for foliage painting, but just ones that kind of have the appearance of.	CHITCHAT
A traditional paintbrush type of look.	CHITCHAT
And some of those are nice for.	CHITCHAT
For indicating Groups of leaves, and stuff like that.	CHITCHAT
Just smoking out some.	CHITCHAT
Areas.	CHITCHAT
Blending.	CHITCHAT
I really like the smudge brush.	CHITCHAT
He probably painted a forest worth of cheese.	CHITCHAT
Repeat a lot of the trees.	CHITCHAT
But I feel like I've painted more trees at a distance like this kind of scene where the foliage just kind of looks like Little Tufts.	CHITCHAT
I need to paint more trees, like doing proper tree studies where it's like.	CHITCHAT
Closer up to the tree and really study, the shapes of the trees.	CHITCHAT
So OK there's a few different bits of foliage here.	O
I'm going to start on the left.	O
There is a dead Bush.	O
That's very important to the scene.	O
I'm just going to.	O
Kind of scribble in with a sketching brush.	O
The main shape of it.	O
Main branches is on a new layer so I can resize it and move it around if I don't like what I'm doing.	O
Jackson Joker says Hello, he's watching their forgot his password high.	CHITCHAT
Jackson thanks for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
I'm like Queen of forgetting my password on things don't get me started on that I try.	CHITCHAT
I'm trying to be better, but I understand.	CHITCHAT
OK, so we got this going to make a new layer and take a textured brush.	O
Which one I recently have acquired some new brushes, they have interesting textures stuff like this.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
This could be a fun one to use for a kind of like Brushy dead.	O
Bush kind of texture look at that that's cool.	O
I like it.	O
Make a new layer and go back to my sketch brush.	O
OK, crazy cool.	CHITCHAT
Anile sketch in a little bit of my own details there.	O
So now it's making that at the push in it's kind of making this area behind it stand out as like?	O
What's going on with this.	CHITCHAT
Random color me builders get rid of that.	O
Yeah, that could be better if anything, we can highlight behind there, so that the Bush stands out more.	O
Things are going OK.	O

I'm going to duplicate the Bush layer so it's easier to see.	O
And I think we got our dead.	O
Bush I made it bigger than the in the reference.	O
Can also lock the transparency take the Airbrush and give it a little bit of a gradient?	O
Hey Pokey, no worries.	CHITCHAT
OK let's see.	CHITCHAT
Top.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, guys look at this is what Pokey shared with me.	CHITCHAT
Thank you I'm honored to masterpiece.	CHITCHAT
Excellent I'm going to just save that.	CHITCHAT
If I remember struggling and painting.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm going to merge the Bush down.	O
I think I like it.	CHITCHAT
Nobody has said anything bad about it.	O
So far, so let's move on, I think we're good.	O
Let's go to the right side of the canvas.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Do the same kind of thing I'm going to Stencil often area.	O
So it makes it easier for me to paint with in that spot because for example.	O
If I try to make marks for the foliage.	O
I can't go below and paint over the rock so just creating little Stencil area.	O
And then Yeah, over here, there's a bunch of little round like rounded Tufts of.	O
Of color.	O
And they're not so.	O
Definitive as like there's one plant here, one plant here.	O
We're inclined here.	O
They're kind of like just all these little little Tufts so.	O
Kind of make up.	O
Little area together.	O
So that'll be than you.	CHITCHAT
New area and I'm going to keep this all on a separate layer 'cause.	O
I'm not sold on what I'm doing here yet, but.	CHITCHAT
I think with a little bit more layering it could work up a couple more painted some more detail.	O
So we go with a little bit more blue green the further we get away from us.	O
I'm going to probably be relying a little bit more on Blue Green 'cause.	O
We're going to get that sort of atmospheric effect.	O
And.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Let's queue shift this a little bit.	O
Yeah, a little bit warmer, maybe less saturated.	O
I didn't feel like the foliage.	O
I was painting in felt like it was part of the scene needs to be more affected by the environment, so a little bit more.	O
Little bit more A?	O
Warm colors.	O
OK, so I'm going to make a selection back here of the shape of this.	O
Bush or tree, I can't really tell based on how far away, we are.	O
Use a texture brush we also want to give.	O
Some shadow to the side.	O
Kindly was talking about painting clouds earlier, you can do the same thing with the foliage use a texture brush to paint in an he's a texture brush to erase out and that will kind of start giving.	O

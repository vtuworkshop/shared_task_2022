Some interesting shapes and you know with trees and bushes, you're going to see through them a little bit, it's not like a perfectly solid.	O
Mass.	O
And that's one of the really pretty things about them.	CHITCHAT

Let's not zoom in on it over here is a.	O
Not fully dead, Bush but you know conditions are conditions are rough out here that boy yourself, either side.	O
I mean at least, there's some water going through here.	O
They've got a chance.	CHITCHAT
There's also a Bush or tree coming up here.	O
He their crawl, I actually have a plugin for my color wheel.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
If you go oops well.	CHITCHAT
Me, I just reset that.	O
Yeah, if you go to window color.	O
Recent updates of photo shop have added a lot to the color wheel so.	O
The reason I originally got Coulouris was because a previous photo shop didn't have this but now now.	O
Now it's here.	O
So you can go to window color annual see you can have the triangle color wheel.	O
It might be set up with a huge cube so if it looks like this, then you can just go to these 3.	O
Go to the little drop down and then you can click sliders if you want sliders.	O
RGB sliders HSB sliders ellaby sliders and if you want the.	O
The color we all there's a triangle color wheel?	O
Which.	O
I prefer.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
I use I keep curious in because it has some other features that I like to that.	O
I think are cool, but photo shop keeps updating and adding new features so pretty.	O
Pretty happy with the recent updates.	CHITCHAT
I don't know if I would have got coolers in the 1st place earlier.	CHITCHAT
If photo shop had the triangular color wheel, but now now it's there, so yeah.	CHITCHAT
It's pretty sweet.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, no problem what brushes are using I love textured brushes these are some.	O
Brushes that I collected overtime, I can actually give you a link to my brush brush set.	O

If you click that so don't click it and less you want my brushes, but there you go.	CHITCHAT
You know, I don't know that I really.	CHITCHAT
I think the foliage is like with the exception of the dead.	O
Bush on the left.	O
I like that one because it doesn't add a different color.	O
It's like the same color is the rocks.	O
But I don't know if I'm a fan of the right side all these greens and stuff.	O
I kind of like it better without them.	O
I don't know about you guys kind of sad 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I was like really excited to add the foliage.	O
It's not really doing much for me.	O
I think what I'm going to do is turn off the layer and just start with some of the distant foliage up here there's some.	O
Greens up Top, Here that I think are really pretty.	O
So I'm going to try painting those in and see how that goes see if we like that.	O

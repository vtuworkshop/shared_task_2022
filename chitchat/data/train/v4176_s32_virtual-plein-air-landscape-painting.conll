And maybe we'll keep it really minimal.	O
Maybe we won't go all in with all the Bush is.	O
Yeah, thanks Basey.	CHITCHAT
It's always fun to play with new brushes.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, I like foliage just maybe not the green color.	O
Yeah, you know it's possible that I just didn't really.	O
Didn't really grab like the best color?	O
I mean in the reference.	O
I think it looks nice.	O
Like I like.	CHITCHAT
What's going on there, but I don't really like?	CHITCHAT
Why was ending up with?	CHITCHAT
So I'm picking a lighter green with some almost yellows.	O
And.	O
Painting in where the the light is hitting these greens.	O
Beer without if about a lot of foliage.	O
It's yeah.	CHITCHAT
I think I'm just saturating it, too much like if I go to image adjust oops with the layer if I can just just Hue saturation just just desaturate that I think it looks so much better.	O
Are just going to too crazy?	CHITCHAT
But I think I do think it's very pretty, especially in the original reference.	O
These like layers and layers of green and the ridges of rock going up the side here, so, so pretty.	O
There's actually some more.	O
Details in the rock that I never that I didn't get to put in yet.	O
Some darker.	O
That's Wycliff's yeah.	CHITCHAT
Really enjoyed this painting.	CHITCHAT
Puzzled me and if you had a few moments but.	CHITCHAT
End up liking it a lot.	CHITCHAT
Gay Pokey Good Luck enjoy the brushes and I hope you have fun with your landscape.	CHITCHAT
Those better with a minimal.	CHITCHAT
Cheating.	CHITCHAT
There is one Bush that I kind of want to try adding.	O
Ah thanks crazy me, too me too.	CHITCHAT
You got to appreciate the ones that they go nicely go smoothly.	CHITCHAT
There's a there's a Bush coming out from here that has a very nice emotion, too, it's like.	O
Like bending over and kind of blowing in the wind camping.	O
With all your landscape experience how difficult would you say this one is?	CHITCHAT
I would say this one is very difficult, honestly like.	O
I mean, if the water is?	O
I'm still not like super happy without the waters came out, but I am happy with like the cloud basically.	O

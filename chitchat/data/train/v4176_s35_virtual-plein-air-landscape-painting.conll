Yes.	O
Also see the previous painting like the process.	CHITCHAT
It's very calming.	CHITCHAT
Thank you so much.	CHITCHAT
That's nice to hear I'm glad you enjoyed it.	CHITCHAT
Thanks everyone for hanging out.	CHITCHAT
Enjoy the painting alright, so I'm going to show some finishing effects.	O
It kind of depends on the scene like what you're going to do as far as a little polishing things but actually there's one more thing with this rock.	O
That's bothering me, I need a hard edge right there.	O
I'm going to get stuck with like that.	CHITCHAT
Last minute thing where you're doing a million little.	CHITCHAT
Oh my gosh, I could spend so long on this piece if I let myself.	CHITCHAT
OK.	CHITCHAT
New layer.	O
I'm going to put the layer on multiply and grab the Airbrush.	O
And use a straight warm color.	O
I'm just going to collect from like mud mud kind of color.	O
And zoom out.	O
And just kind of make a little bit moving net effect.	O
We want to go too far with this, but it helps to draw your eye to the center of the scene going to color pic from the?	O
Purple for the Sky so like before after 4 after and also lower the opacity if that was too much or you know.	O
And then I'm going to make a new layer and play with may be having.	O
A little bit and we did some color dajing earlier, so I don't want to overdo that's really easy too.	O
But I was thinking.	O
Maybe color Dodge at tiny tiny bit in the Sky is believe it or not right on the cloud that might be really nice thing to do just.	O
Just the very Top of the cloud.	O
Will little light hitting so it gets closer to that pure white?	O
Thank you girl.	CHITCHAT
Very calming voice it's very nice and soothing to see the process along side and take us on creative journey will thank you.	CHITCHAT
I'm glad you guys enjoyed it.	CHITCHAT
I enjoyed painting and hanging out with you is very relaxing.	CHITCHAT
I don't usually.	CHITCHAT
I don't usually stream in the evenings on my time, but it could it could happen.	CHITCHAT
I like that very flexible we can.	CHITCHAT
Hum.	CHITCHAT
Stream whenever I don't know what time is good for you guys, but it's possible with regularity that I would start like a few hours early than the earlier than this.	CHITCHAT
So I hope you still be able to come by but.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it was very, very nice.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, look at that I like that.	CHITCHAT
I like the glow in the clouds that makes me happy.	O
Where else can we sneak in some color Dodge while I'm?	O
Try not to over do it.	O
Yeah, just a little bit of warm glow here.	O
Sometimes it's hard to control 'cause when you use these layer effects sometimes they?	O
They changed the Hue slightly usually it's 2:00 AM, or warm direction.	O
But you don't always want that so.	O
Sometimes it's better to just.	O
Go on a normal mode and pick the color that you want if you know specifically what you want.	O
But color Dodge has a really nice glow effect.	O
So.	CHITCHAT
Oh man.	CHITCHAT
Right here.	O
Dear Uncle, Highway.	CHITCHAT
I don't know about that purple.	O
One thing that I learned kind of recently is that using an airbrush and just making just painting.	O
The glow on normal mode can sometimes be really nice too.	O
I always used to instantly go to layer blending modes.	O
When I wanted to add a glow effect sometimes normal mode is the best choice.	O

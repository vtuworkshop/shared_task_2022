It's just not the one we think of.	O
Gives a lot of nice atmospheric feeling.	O
We're screen screen, I think is kind of similar.	CHITCHAT
We're missing shadow here.	O
Yeah, that's a little something's a little.	CHITCHAT
Should be a shadow under this?	O
Kate will merge those and then.	O
Finally, it's nice sometimes too.	O
Go to sharpen or you can use the unsharp mask.	O
It's easy to just kind of go to file sharpen I mean, filter sharpen and then.	O
Skype if I It shows your brush strokes a little bit more crisp.	O
How do you study atmospheric stuff just from a lot of photo studies?	CHITCHAT
I think I mean plein air painting is like the best way to study that because I think it.	CHITCHAT
Or just when you're outside looking around because photos can show it, but it's never the same.	CHITCHAT
It's such a magical feeling and it's mostly you get it from when you're in.	CHITCHAT
Spaces where things are you have something big, like mountains or you're able to see far away.	CHITCHAT
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Yeah, it's very it's very.	CHITCHAT
Very beautiful an I think yeah, doing photo studies can definitely help with that.	CHITCHAT
But just paying attention.	CHITCHAT
When you're outside is going to help even more 'cause I think a lot of the effects are lost in photos.	CHITCHAT
Unchecking transparency shapes layer from blending modes really brings a nice glow.	O
I've heard that.	CHITCHAT
I've heard that what I ended up doing my friend told me trick that I use a lot and it's kind of similar.	O
I think it's a similar effect to what you're saying is like instead of putting the layer on color Dodge and just leaving the blank layer if you pop in a black paint bucket and then use color Dodge that way it kind of does, I think it does a similar effect?	O
Ann.	CHITCHAT
Well, I'll actually like that magenta what the heck was kind of nice.	O
Maybe I'll leave it in.	O
But yeah, I think it's kind of creating a similar effect.	O
Wow, what a happy happy accident.	CHITCHAT
Some nice things to do at the end to our.	CHITCHAT
Like going through adjustment layers like right now, I'm kind of painting pretty destructively.	O
Like I'm not using any adjustment layers and just going for it, but if you want you can.	O
We can do that and then you can go back and change things selective color is kind of new to me, I recently started playing with this and it's just mind blowing what you can do like the way that you can icily and tweak just specific colors.	O
Be quite the heck it's almost too much power like I start to think I'll never finish.	CHITCHAT
An artwork if I let myself just start messing with this stuff 'cause.	CHITCHAT
I mean, you can just go crazy.	CHITCHAT
You can totally change.	CHITCHAT
The feeling of your peace it's similar.	CHITCHAT
But maybe I should experiment more with the.	CHITCHAT
I'm checking the transparency shapes.	O
I haven't like painted enough with it.	O
Thank you pokey thank you.	CHITCHAT
Was try be selective color?	O
And mess with Big Green's really quick.	O
I don't know if it's actually going to do anything.	O
There's so few.	O
Yeah, like those nothing OK never mind.	O
Um.	CHITCHAT
Yellows maybe Yeah, on the left.	O
We can make it more yellow.	O
The color Dodge gives a lot of magic it does Oh my gosh.	O

about	O
them	O
right	O
now	O
the	O
other	O

about	O
other	O
than	O
a	O
messing	O
with	O
the	O
audio	O
it	O
that's	O
basically	O
all	O
he	O
did	O
before	O
the	O
stream	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
uh	O
I	O
guess	O
test	O
test	O
the	O
audio	O
for	O
the	O
stream	O
and	O
do	O
another	O
sargent	O
painting	O
I	O
shouldn't	O
say	O
other	O
sorry	O
my	O

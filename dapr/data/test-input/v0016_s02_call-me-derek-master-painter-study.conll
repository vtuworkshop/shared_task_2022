cool	O
alright	O
with	O
that	O
uh	O
let's	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
pay	O
him	O
now	O
I	O
guess	O
or	O
paint	O
the	O
painting	O
of	O
him	O
I	O
think	O
my	O
process	O
is	O
pretty	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
start	O
with	O
a	O
sketch	O
and	O
then	O
fill	O
it	O
in	O
from	O
there	O
let's	O
jump	O
right	O
into	O
it	O
man	O
alright	O
so	O
starting	O
with	O
the	O
usual	O
you	O
just	O
move	O
this	O
usual	O
brush	O
a	O
pencil	O
brush	O
here	O
I'm	O
hooked	O
on	O
something	O
I'm	O
hooked	O
on	O
something	O
something	O
weird	O
stand	O
or	O
is	O
it	O
the	O
not	O
sure	O
well	O
yeah	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
my	O
normal	O
since	O
the	O
brush	O
circles	O
loosen	O
up	O
1	O
second	O
alright	O
so	O
this	O
we	O
can	O
get	O
like	O
a	O
make	O
her	O
own	O
rectangle	O
here	O
for	O
the	O
canvas	O
something	O
like	O
this	O
alright	O
we	O
zoom	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
think	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
just	O
crop	O
this	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
might	O
be	O
better	O
so	O
if	O
I	O
do	O
something	O
like	O
this	O
I	O
think	O
yeah	O
gotta	O
consider	O
how	O
much	O
time	O
I	O
have	O
here	O
so	O
let's	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
just	O
crop	O
it	O
to	O
his	O
first	O
continue	O
with	O
the	O
theme	O
of	O
continue	O
with	O
the	O
theme	O
of	O
portraits	O
might	O
as	O
well	O
just	O
do	O
study	O
of	O
face	O
area	O
region	O
he	O
moves	O
how	O
you	O
doing	O
man	O
I	O
enjoy	O
that	O
after	O
you	O
click	O
the	O
appreciate	O
button	O
in	O
by	O
hand	O
stream	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
click	O
it	O
again	O
it's	O
labeled	O
and	O
appreciating	O
really	O
on	O
appreciated	O
so	O
I	O
guess	O
it's	O
like	O
you're	O
removing	O
your	O
like	O
and	O
that's	O
that's	O
an	O
appreciating	O
I	O
guess	O
so	O
I	O
understand	O
I	O
get	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
interesting	O
word	O
choice	O
that	O
they're	O
using	O
'cause	O
it's	O
not	O
wait	O
let	O
me	O
just	O
clarify	O
it's	O
not	O
it's	O
not	O
actually	O

like	O
a	O
thumbs	O

like	O
this	O
persons	O
on	O
appreciate	O

thankfully	O
there's	O
there's	O
other	O
means	O
to	O
getting	O
rid	O

those	O
and	O
it's	O
basically	O
just	O
deleting	O

blocking	O
out	O
the	O
hate	O
you	O

the	O
unsolicited	O

that	O
can	O
be	O
constructive	O
right	O
constructive	O
criticism	O
I	O
wouldn't	O

of	O
stoppage	O

all	O
said	O
and	O
done	O
people	O
are	O
still	O
going	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
think	O
there's	O
there's	O
no	O
real	O
changing	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
behavior	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
feel	O
very	O
opinionated	O
hum	O
and	O
might	O
just	O
have	O
the	O
best	O
intentions	O
right	O
they	O
could	O
very	O
well	O
have	O
the	O
best	O
intentions	O
for	O
the	O
artists	O
and	O
they	O
are	O
up	O
there	O
they're	O
seeing	O
in	O
criticizing	O
right	O
but	O
it's	O
just	O
it's	O
just	O
always	O
best	O
to	O
ask	O
is	O
it	O
cool	O
if	O
I	O
give	O
you	O
some	O
feedback	O
or	O
are	O
you	O
still	O
kind	O
of	O
working	O
'cause	O
that's	O
it	O
right	O
like	O
as	O
we	O
all	O
know	O
if	O
you've	O
ever	O
worked	O
on	O
a	O
drawing	O
or	O
painting	O
is	O
when	O
it's	O
not	O
finished	O
there's	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
you	O
might	O
eventually	O
get	O
to	O
write	O
with	O
correcting	O
and	O
adjusting	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
a	O
painting	O
in	O
a	O
drawing	O
often	O
times	O
can	O
start	O
one	O
way	O
in	O
and	O
finish	O
another	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
what	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
really	O
rough	O
sketch	O
and	O
then	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
lower	O
the	O
opacity	O
and	O
then	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
clean	O
up	O
the	O
lines	O
even	O
further	O
and	O
then	O
get	O
ready	O
for	O
the	O
painting	O
i'll	O
try	O
and	O
put	O
the	O
metal	O
to	O
the	O
pedal	O
try	O
i'll	O
try	O
and	O
metal	O
with	O
the	O
pedal	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
there	O
we	O
go	O
and	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
hasty	O
with	O
this	O
one	O
flip	O
take	O
a	O
look	O
at	O
this	O
say	O
that	O
that's	O
where	O
the	O
eyes	O
are	O
we	O
shape	O
is	O
canvas	O
here	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
alright	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
with	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
lower	O
the	O
opacity	O

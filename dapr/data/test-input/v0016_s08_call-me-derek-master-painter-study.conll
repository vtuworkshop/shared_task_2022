it	O
doesn't	O
look	O
better	O
original	O
my	O
opinion	O
yeah	O
yeah	O
remasters	O
can	O
be	O
pretty	O
tricky	O
a	O
depending	O
on	O
who's	O
doing	O
it	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
they	O
square	O
has	O
you	O
know	O
they've	O
invested	O
a	O
lot	O
into	O
final	O
fantasy	O
7	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
that's	O
basically	O
all	O
in	O
on	O
these	O
games	O
now	O
the	O
final	O
fantasy	O
7	O
remake	O
games	O
I	O
I	O
remember	O
hearing	O
squaresoft	O
wasn't	O
doing	O
too	O
well	O
financially	O
hum	O
so	O
they're	O
kind	O
of	O
well	O
I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
say	O
grasping	O
at	O
straws	O
but	O
it's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
say	O
something	O
along	O
the	O
lines	O
of	O
like	O
when	O
blizzard	O
blizzard	O
announced	O
classic	O
servers	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
we'd	O
never	O
see	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
near	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
world	O
of	O
warcraft	O
like	O
for	O
the	O
warcraft	O
lifespan	O
I'm	O
not	O
really	O
getting	O
that	O
feeling	O
anymore	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
classic	O
in	O
retail	O
can	O
easily	O
coexist	O
right	O
did	O
I	O
did	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
that	O
head	O
bigger	O
thanks	O
alright	O
see	O
the	O
ear	O
space	O
here	O
holler	O
that	O
thing	O
this	O
comes	O
way	O
down	O
lower	O
a	O
little	O
higher	O
by	O
that	O
um	O
have	O
you	O
purchased	O
the	O
ps	O
five	O
I	O
probably	O
won't	O
push	O
it	O
purchase	O
it	O
until	O
a	O
year	O
after	O
um	O
or	O
whenever	O
their	O
second	O
generation	O
of	O
ps	O
five	O
come	O
out	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
however	O
if	O
they	O
announce	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
exclusivity	O
that	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
play	O
then	O
i'll	O
probably	O
get	O
one	O
before	O
the	O
release	O
of	O
the	O
next	O
versions	O
of	O
the	O
ps5	O
right	O
from	O
my	O
experience	O
of	O
find	O
playstation	O
besides	O
ps1	O
um	O
'cause	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
first	O
generation	O
ps1	O
the	O
first	O
generation	O
is	O
pooped	O
out	O
after	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
months	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
it's	O
just	O
like	O
the	O
rushing	O
to	O
build	O
all	O
these	O
playstations	O
and	O
they	O
they	O
don't	O
give	O
a	O
full	O
quality	O
check	O
that	O
they	O
need	O
but	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
usually	O
die	O
or	O
break	O
or	O
something	O
so	O
i'll	O
wait	O
a	O
bit	O
and	O
less	O
there's	O
something	O
that	O
I	O
I'm	O
just	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
play	O
like	O
what	O
is	O
it	O
called	O
now	O
I'm	O
actually	O
going	O
to	O
mean	O
from	O
south	O
this	O
time	O
from	O
sauce	O
new	O
game	O
something	O
else	O
and	O
ring	O
eldon	O
ring	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
release	O
date	O
for	O
that	O
and	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
it's	O
exclusive	O
does	O
sony	O
he	O
still	O
in	O
ps3	O
yeah	O
man	O
ps	O
we	O
had	O
tons	O
of	O
solid	O
games	O
alone	O
but	O
the	O
metal	O
gear	O
solid	O

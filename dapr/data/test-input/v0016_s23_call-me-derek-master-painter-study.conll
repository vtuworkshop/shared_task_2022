this	O
isn't	O
quite	O
finished	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
alright	O
for	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
hours	O
I'm	O
just	O
messing	O
around	O
um	O
so	O
i'll	O
be	O
back	O
next	O
week	O
uh	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
maybe	O
we'll	O
do	O
some	O
more	O
or	O
some	O
of	O
those	O
would	O
be	O
some	O
more	O
portraits	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
what	O
we	O
will	O
do	O
is	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
will	O
do	O
that	O
exercise	O
that	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
moose	O
who	O
shared	O
it	O
or	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
if	O
somebody	O
else	O
maybe	O
if	O
it	O
wasn't	O
most	O
of	O
somebody	O
else	O
'cause	O
I	O
didn't	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
it	O
I'm	O
not	O
smart	O
enough	O
you	O
want	O
portrait	O
study	O
like	O
I'm	O
just	O
taking	O
using	O
like	O
pencil	O
lines	O
or	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
a	O
maybe	O
a	O
clean	O
line	O
ish	O
you	O
want	O
portrait	O
that	O
based	O
off	O
of	O
the	O
portrait	O
the	O
reference	O
rather	O
and	O
then	O
do	O
you	O
want	O
with	O
exaggerated	O
features	O
do	O
one	O
uh	O
from	O
a	O
different	O
angle	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
reference	O
and	O
then	O
do	O
I	O
guess	O
just	O
do	O
it	O
like	O
a	O
random	O
head	O
for	O
or	O
heads	O
a	O
drawing	O
I	O

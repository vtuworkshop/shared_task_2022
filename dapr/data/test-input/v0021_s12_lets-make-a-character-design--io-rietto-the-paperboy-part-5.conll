that	O
that's	O
the	O
color	O
purple	O
is	O
very	O
well	O
if	O
it's	O
amazing	O
so	O
yeah	O
that's	O
actually	O
what	O
I	O
chose	O
purple	O
for	O
this	O
illustration	O
I	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
go	O
very	O
well	O
with	O
the	O
things	O
the	O
the	O
agency	O
where	O
our	O
paper	O
boy	O
is	O
working	O
is	O
kids	O
um	O

a	O
really	O
upset	O
yeah	O
sorry	O
i've	O
got	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
lost	O
in	O
my	O
mind	O
there	O
ok	O
so	O
let	O
us	O
check	O
the	O
shadows	O
on	O
the	O
lighting	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
we	O
could	O
apply	O
maybe	O
more	O
lighting	O
in	O
the	O
purple	O
part	O
of	O
this	O
box	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
this	O
and	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
blend	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
finger	O
tool	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
so	O
it	O
looks	O
much	O
more	O
this	O
oh	O
I	O
think	O

that	O
this	O

lot	O
of	O
time	O
because	O

now	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
landing	O

I'm	O
going	O
to	O
apply	O
just	O
a	O
bit	O
in	O
here	O
so	O
we	O
can	O
differ	O
deferring	O
this	O
so	O

more	O
cool	O
can	O
you	O
see	O
that	O
the	O
all	O
the	O
now	O

looks	O
much	O
more	O
deep	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O

going	O
to	O
apply	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
land	O
here	O

stiff	O
so	O
tough	O
yeah	O
um	O

little	O
bit	O
more	O
shuttle	O
to	O
these	O
giant	O
gear	O
maybe	O

more	O
depth	O
in	O
some	O
in	O
some	O
of	O

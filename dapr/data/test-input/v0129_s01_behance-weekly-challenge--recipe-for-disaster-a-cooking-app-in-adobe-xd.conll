uh	O
like	O
I	O

kind	O
of	O
like	O

end	O
sheffield	O
I	O

this	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
where	O
I	O
started	O
with	O
the	O
colours	O
down	O
here	O
in	O
this	O
like	O
idea	O
for	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
brand	O
which	O
is	O
this	O
recipe	O
for	O
disaster	O
and	O
something	O
so	O
far	O
and	O
I	O
started	O
putting	O
together	O
someday	O
it	O
really	O
bare	O
bones	O
kind	O
of	O
screens	O
in	O
xd	O
study	O
of	O
his	O
onboarding	O
app	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
have	O
like	O
when	O
they're	O
a	O
user	O
using	O
this	O
app	O
so	O
cooking	O
apps	O
in	O
general	O
they	O
kind	O
of	O
wind	O
up	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
them	O
wind	O
up	O
in	O
this	O
gray	O
area	O
where	O
they	O
don't	O
really	O
satisfy	O
their	O
audience	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
wind	O
up	O
with	O
users	O
who	O
are	O
really	O
like	O
home	O
cooks	O
like	O
they	O
like	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
equipment	O
they	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
ingredients	O
and	O
they	O
don't	O
feel	O
like	O
recipe	O
apps	O
gonna	O
go	O
far	O
enough	O
to	O
satisfy	O
all	O
their	O
needs	O
and	O
then	O
on	O
the	O
other	O
option	O
in	O
the	O
spectrum	O
you	O
have	O
people	O
who	O
are	O
really	O
not	O
that	O
chefs	O
who	O
don't	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
ingredients	O
or	O
cooking	O
appliances	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
and	O
they	O
just	O
feel	O
overwhelmed	O
by	O
the	O
experience	O
so	O
with	O
this	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
kept	O
it	O
pretty	O
bare	O
bones	O
for	O
what	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
show	O
but	O
also	O
allow	O
the	O
option	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
add	O
on	O
to	O
this	O
add	O
on	O
the	O
the	O
tools	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
so	O
for	O
this	O
onboarding	O
experience	O
you're	O
gonna	O
give	O
agreed	O
with	O
kind	O
of	O
four	O
4545	O
screens	O
of	O
the	O
first	O
one	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
what	O
sort	O
of	O
appliances	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
on	O
hand	O
what	O
sortof	O
what's	O
the	O
number	O
of	O
people	O
in	O
your	O
household	O
how	O
many	O
people	O
before	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
any	O
food	O
intolerances	O
dietary	O
restrictions	O
etc	O
and	O
then	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
basic	O
equipments	O
you	O
have	O
you	O
have	O
pots	O
and	O
pans	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
cast	O
iron	O
skillet	O
baking	O
sheets	O
all	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O
and	O
based	O
on	O
the	O
user	O
selections	O
that's	O
going	O
to	O
build	O
a	O
profile	O
so	O
that	O
the	O
recipe	O
search	O
only	O
calls	O
recipes	O
that	O
use	O
items	O
that	O
somebody	O
has	O
my	O
kitchen	O
currently	O
so	O
this	O
is	O
basically	O
a	O
very	O
like	O
broad	O
picture	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
get	O
into	O
the	O
rest	O
research	O
uhm	O
I	O
really	O
like	O
this	O
idea	O
I	O
would	O
just	O
being	O
like	O
a	O
blank	O
a	O
blank	O
screen	O
it	O
just	O
asks	O
you	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
are	O
you	O
cooking	O
or	O
like	O
what	O
what	O
ingredients	O
you	O
have	O
an	O
you	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
it's	O
just	O
a	O
search	O
box	O
and	O
you	O
type	O
in	O
things	O
right	O
so	O
you	O
type	O
in	O
like	O
I	O
have	O
I	O
have	O
carrots	O
and	O
he	O
had	O
entered	O
adds	O
carrots	O
on	O
the	O
list	O
then	O
I	O
have	O
this	O
ingredient	O
of	O
that	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
add	O
one	O
or	O
you	O
get	O
a	O
whole	O
bunch	O
of	O
different	O
ones	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
hit	O
go	O
and	O
it	O
just	O
pulls	O
recipes	O
that	O
use	O
the	O
ingredients	O
that	O
you've	O
asked	O
for	O
and	O
the	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
user	O
profile	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O
in	O
your	O
kitchen	O
and	O
that's	O
the	O
idea	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
not	O
like	O
sifting	O
through	O
tons	O
of	O
options	O
it's	O
just	O
very	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
like	O
I	O
have	O
these	O
items	O
what	O
can	O
I	O
make	O
with	O
them	O
so	O
my	O
plan	O
is	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
on	O
boarding	O
for	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
this	O
onboarding	O
process	O
after	O
the	O
user	O
gets	O
through	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
questions	O
so	O
you're	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
the	O
idea	O
is	O
you're	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
badge	O
because	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
tie	O
it	O
back	O
into	O
the	O
sortof	O
corentin	O
award	O
idea	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
pick	O
uh	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
kitchen	O
equipment	O
and	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
supplies	O
then	O
you'll	O
get	O
the	O
prepared	O
for	O
you	O

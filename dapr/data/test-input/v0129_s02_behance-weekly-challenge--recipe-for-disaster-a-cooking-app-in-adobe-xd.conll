badge	O
if	O
you	O
only	O
pick	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
these	O
options	O
we	O
don't	O
have	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
stuff	O
in	O
your	O
kitchen	O
you	O
really	O
get	O
the	O
resourceful	O
badge	O
'cause	O
we're	O
trying	O
to	O
keep	O
a	O
positive	O
either	O
way	O
so	O
you're	O
either	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
resourceful	O
and	O
they	O
can	O
do	O
with	O
what	O
you've	O
got	O
or	O
you're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
well	O
prepared	O
and	O
making	O
gourmet	O
deals	O
in	O
your	O
fancy	O
kitchen	O
so	O
let's	O
get	O
started	O
I	O
have	O
uh	O
this	O
plan	O
like	O
I	O
said	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
want	O
this	O
sortof	O
unboarding	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
indicate	O
in	O
some	O
way	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
swipe	O
through	O
these	O
screens	O
which	O
will	O
I	O
have	O
this	O
little	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
here	O
I'm	O
I'm	O
kind	O
of	O
thinking	O
that	O
these	O
icons	O
will	O
sit	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
these	O
plates	O
so	O
like	O
idea	O
of	O
like	O
swiping	O
through	O
plates	O
as	O
the	O
interaction	O
and	O
but	O
the	O
problem	O
is	O
that	O
like	O
these	O
colors	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
work	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
currently	O
because	O
my	O
icons	O
are	O
using	O
this	O
sort	O
of	O
peach	O
peachy	O
pink	O
color	O
so	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
that	O
and	O
then	O
like	O
the	O
active	O
and	O
inactive	O
states	O
for	O
each	O
of	O
these	O
icons	O
uhm	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
really	O
thinks	O
that	O
was	O
the	O
big	O
things	O
that	O
take	O
her	O
son	O
the	O
layout	O
some	O
of	O
this	O
stuff	O
in	O
our	O
screens	O
and	O
if	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
something	O
sort	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
we'll	O
see	O
where	O
we	O
get	O
to	O
we'll	O
see	O
we'll	O
see	O
how	O
far	O
we	O
get	O
to	O
today	O
so	O
that	O
being	O
said	O
I'm	O
gonna	O
start	O
putting	O
in	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
home	O
start	O
thinking	O
about	O
what	O
kind	O
of	O
questions	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
phrase	O
questions	O
so	O
uh	O
what's	O
up	O
chat	O
happening	O
who	O
stop	O
by	O
let's	O
see	O
you	O
how	O
are	O
you	O
doing	O
I'm	O
not	O
I'm	O
not	O
let	O
me	O
know	O
if	O
I'm	O
pronouncing	O
your	O
name	O
correctly	O
nice	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
corey	O
is	O
saying	O
maybe	O
the	O
plates	O
had	O
just	O
have	O
the	O
title	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
the	O
icons	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
white	O
space	O
below	O
now	O
that's	O
a	O
really	O
good	O
idea	O
is	O
maybe	O
we	O
can	O
have	O
just	O
the	O
sort	O
of	O
questions	O
or	O
the	O
um	O
statements	O
are	O
recorded	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
be	O
over	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
plate	O
and	O
then	O
that	O
leaves	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
room	O
for	O
icons	O
we	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
worry	O
so	O
much	O
about	O
the	O
colour	O
contrast	O
so	O
maybe	O
will	O
go	O
that	O
route	O
let's	O
see	O
how	O
it	O
looks	O
so	O
if	O
I	O
both	O
of	O
these	O
guys	O
up	O
when	O
I	O
get	O
to	O
swap	O
the	O
order	O
of	O
elements	O
here	O
excellent	O
thing	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
up	O
and	O
there's	O
no	O
logo	O
I	O
believe	O
only	O
little	O
bit	O
below	O
sounds	O
like	O
when	O
it	O
be	O
careful	O
of	O
the	O
top	O
apple	O
has	O
the	O
notch	O
at	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
the	O
devices	O
so	O
we	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
put	O
them	O
directly	O
over	O
top	O
so	O
I'm	O
gonna	O
just	O
going	O
by	O
layers	O
new	O
folders	O
in	O
front	O
not	O
for	O
center	O
in	O
nature	O
what	O
everything	O
is	O
centered	O

of	O
fun	O
fun	O

you	O
follow	O
logic	O
syntax	O
is	O
experience	O
based	O
logic	O
so	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
the	O
order	O
questions	O
for	O
his	O
onboarding	O
experience	O
I	O
was	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
group	O
them	O
it	O
may	O
make	O
more	O
sense	O
I	O
guess	O
in	O
this	O
case	O
to	O
do	O
reverse	O
these	O
two	O
days	O
I	O
might	O
do	O
I	O
might	O
put	O
what	O
tools	O
are	O
in	O
your	O
kitchen	O
and	O
then	O
um	O
how	O
many	O
people	O
are	O
you	O
looking	O
for	O
and	O
then	O
guide	O
her	O
restrictions	O
because	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
go	O
from	O
like	O
equipment	O
down	O
too	O
so	O
we're	O
starting	O
with	O
appliances	O
to	O
tools	O
to	O
people	O
to	O
specific	O
stuff	O
people	O
so	O
I	O
guess	O
I'm	O
going	O
from	O
why	O
your	O
large	O
select	O
appliances	O
are	O
larger	O
than	O
tools	O
and	O
that's	O
probably	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
step	O
in	O
determining	O
the	O
user	O
profile	O
is	O
you're	O
going	O
to	O
want	O
to	O
I	O
mean	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
know	O
people	O
got	O
stoves	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
it's	O
a	O
mixture	O
of	O
code	O
finisher	O
of	O
like	O
logical	O
progression	O
so	O
trying	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
common	O
elements	O
organized	O
or	O
like	O
into	O
groups	O
together	O
and	O
also	O
just	O
experience	O
based	O
I	O
guess	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
what	O
feels	O
right	O
so	O
I	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
leading	O
with	O
the	O
appliances	O
also	O
it	O
yeah	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
the	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
things	O
love	O
say	O
about	O
fashion	O
course	O
and	O
everything	O
the	O
water	O
jacket	O
yeah	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
makes	O
more	O
sense	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
I	O
didn't	O
make	O
the	O
change	O
that	O
so	O
that	O
means	O
that	O
the	O
next	O
one	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
our	O
table	O
which	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
out	O
here	O
open	O
document	O
like	O
I	O
said	O
I'm	O
probably	O
going	O
to	O
set	O
them	O
up	O
on	O
this	O
but	O
then	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
greet	O
them	O
with	O
the	O
this	O
elements	O
that	O
we	O
can	O
slide	O
to	O
drag	O
to	O
slide	O
over	O
things	O
these	O
these	O
icons	O
and	O
this	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
slide	O
over	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
change	O
from	O
this	O
dot	O
highlighted	O
to	O
evil	O
not	O
highlighting	O
but	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
actually	O
see	O
I'm	O
doing	O
which	O
is	O
why	O
I'm	O
doing	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
stuff	O
on	O
this	O
screen	O
here	O
mostly	O
dry	O
tie	O
down	O
select	O
so	O
yeah	O
thing	O
about	O
actually	O
copy	O
wanted	O
to	O

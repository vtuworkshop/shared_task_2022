I	O

the	O

I	O
don't	O
really	O
know	O
what	O
we	O
can	O
take	O
away	O
from	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
think	O
about	O
this	O
project	O
though	O
as	O
a	O
whole	O
it	O
feels	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
like	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
in	O
3d	O
or	O
it	O
should	O
be	O
modeled	O
in	O
this	O
way	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
build	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
popsicle	O
sticks	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
the	O
ideal	O
version	O
of	O
this	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
diorama	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
like	O
push	O
a	O
tiny	O
micro	O
camera	O
through	O
maybe	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
yeah	O
can't	O
do	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
different	O
lights	O
in	O
color	O
or	O
intensity	O
I	O
do	O
so	O
like	O
ideally	O
we're	O
definitely	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
this	O
today	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
I	O
will	O
fumble	O
through	O
without	O
subjecting	O
you	O
all	O
to	O
it	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
want	O
them	O
both	O
to	O
like	O
pulse	O
independently	O
like	O
flicker	O
flicker	O
flicker	O
flicker	O
this	O
one	O
may	O
be	O
going	O
crazy	O
and	O
then	O
this	O
one's	O
going	O
crazy	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
should	O
be	O
you	O
know	O
separate	O
and	O
unique	O
things	O
right	O
the	O
belt	O
ever	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
demonstrate	O
this	O
with	O
your	O
hands	O
but	O
yeah	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
unique	O
colors	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
unique	O
intensities	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
unique	O
flick	O
arena's	O
happening	O
with	O
them	O
that's	O
the	O
idea	O
anyway	O
that	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
unique	O
and	O
interesting	O
things	O
in	O
that	O
way	O
because	O
I	O
really	O
think	O
um	O
just	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
an	O
example	O
how	O
much	O
lighting	O
plays	O
into	O
mood	O
you	O
know	O
now	O
the	O
mood	O
on	O
my	O
face	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
extreme	O
right	O
you	O
might	O
think	O
evans	O
going	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
crazy	O
now	O
just	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
way	O
the	O
lighting	O
situation	O
is	O
but	O
now	O
it's	O
evenly	O
lit	O
and	O
very	O
pleasant	O
so	O
by	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
mess	O
with	O
lighting	O
intensity	O
and	O
lighting	O
situations	O
were	O
able	O
to	O
change	O
the	O
way	O
people	O
feel	O
about	O
something	O
anyway	O
I	O
I	O
literally	O
installed	O
these	O
lights	O
only	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
and	O
took	O
us	O
when	O
I	O
play	O
dungeons	O
and	O
dragons	O
on	O
the	O
internet	O
I	O

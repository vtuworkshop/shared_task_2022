but	O
that	O
generally	O
comes	O
on	O
its	O
own	O
that	O
same	O
concept	O
can	O
be	O
said	O
for	O
her	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you're	O
drawing	O
when	O
you're	O
doing	O
your	O
hair	O
there's	O
like	O
typical	O
hairstyles	O
that	O
everybody	O
does	O
right	O
and	O
there's	O
typical	O
ways	O
that	O
everybody	O
likes	O
to	O
teach	O
her	O
but	O
the	O
keys	O
have	O
fun	O
with	O
it	O
there's	O
so	O
many	O
different	O
hairstyles	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
there's	O
literally	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
just	O
generally	O
teach	O
you	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
her	O
there's	O
a	O
couple	O
basic	O
tips	O
that	O
people	O
can	O
give	O
but	O
you	O
the	O
only	O
way	O
to	O
really	O
truly	O
learn	O
her	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
get	O
your	O
hands	O
very	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
learned	O
in	O
my	O
journey	O
of	O
drawing	O
hair	O
is	O
that	O
here	O
is	O
one	O
giant	O
mass	O
it	O
is	O
definitely	O
not	O
individual	O
strands	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
start	O
drawing	O
we	O
have	O
this	O
nasty	O
habit	O
of	O
drawing	O
tiny	O
strands	O
of	O
hair	O
in	O
the	O
shapes	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
motion	O
of	O
the	O
hair	O
that	O
we're	O
trying	O
to	O
create	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
bad	O
idea	O
it	O
stresses	O
you	O
out	O
you	O
tend	O
to	O
over	O
detail	O
which	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
beginning	O
artists	O
do	O
because	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
stages	O
we	O
we	O
relate	O
detail	O
too	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
skill	O
set	O
and	O
your	O
ability	O
to	O
add	O
detail	O
in	O
a	O
drawing	O
or	O
what	O
not	O
does	O
not	O
does	O
not	O
indicate	O
skill	O
set	O
skill	O
set	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
your	O
efficiency	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
now	O
again	O
this	O
is	O
all	O
opinionated	O
I	O
am	O
just	O
one	O
artist	O
we	O
all	O
learn	O
differently	O
but	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
skill	O
set	O
is	O
basically	O
based	O
on	O
efficiency	O
and	O
accuracy	O
so	O
the	O
more	O
the	O
more	O
accurate	O
you	O
are	O
and	O
more	O
efficient	O
you	O
are	O
at	O
being	O
accurate	O
accurate	O
it	O
will	O
determine	O
how	O
you	O
feel	O
about	O
your	O
skill	O
set	O
'cause	O
I	O
realize	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
started	O
drawing	O
all	O
I	O
cared	O
about	O
was	O
getting	O
accuracy	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
is	O
this	O
going	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
what	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
the	O
biggest	O
issue	O
that	O
always	O
had	O
was	O
like	O
manage	O
this	O
actually	O
going	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
what	O
I	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
I	O
mean	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
can	O
draw	O
it	O
and	O
everything	O
but	O
like	O
after	O
is	O
drawn	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
was	O
it	O
really	O
gonna	O
look	O
like	O
it	O
never	O
really	O
does	O
look	O
like	O
what	O
you	O
intend	O
to	O
100	O
make	O
it	O
look	O
like	O
you	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
go	O
along	O
with	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you're	O
first	O
starting	O
out	O
but	O
then	O
afterwards	O
as	O
I	O
started	O
getting	O
better	O
and	O
better	O
at	O
art	O
and	O
I	O
started	O
drawing	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
things	O
over	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
time	O
it	O
started	O
getting	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
more	O
concerned	O
about	O
how	O
fast	O
I	O
was	O
along	O
with	O
how	O
accurate	O
things	O
were	O
it	O
was	O
it	O
just	O
wasn't	O
good	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
accurate	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
be	O
accurate	O
in	O
fast	O
because	O
if	O
I	O
wasn't	O
fast	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
wasting	O
my	O
time	O
because	O
we	O
we	O
start	O
watching	O
other	O
artists	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
we	O
see	O
how	O
fast	O
and	O
efficient	O
they	O
are	O
an	O
we	O
automatically	O
relate	O
what	O
they	O
do	O
to	O
what	O
we	O
should	O
be	O
doing	O
which	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
idea	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you're	O
learning	O
how	O
to	O
do	O
art	O
you	O
never	O
you	O
never	O
ever	O
ever	O
base	O
your	O
skill	O
set	O
off	O
somebody	O
else's	O
skillset	O
though	O
even	O
though	O
I	O
say	O
that	O
every	O
artist	O
does	O
that	O
it	O
just	O
it's	O
for	O
some	O
reason	O
they	O
just	O
they	O
migrate	O
to	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
it's	O
a	O
really	O
bad	O
thing	O
to	O
get	O
over	O
when	O
you're	O
first	O
starting	O
and	O
it	O
can	O
cause	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
stress	O
and	O
anxiety	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
could	O
make	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
what	O
you're	O
doing	O
isn't	O
worth	O
it	O
and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
beings	O
and	O
as	O
I	O
started	O
becoming	O
better	O
and	O
better	O
at	O
art	O
I	O
notice	O
that	O
I	O
stopped	O
caring	O
about	O
anything	O
more	O
than	O
my	O
knowledge	O
of	O
the	O
skill	O
set	O
which	O
is	O
what	O
I	O
actually	O
love	O
because	O
before	O
I	O
didn't	O
really	O
necessarily	O
care	O
about	O
my	O
skill	O
set	O
all	O
I	O
cared	O
about	O
was	O
people	O
liking	O
what	O
I	O
did	O
which	O
to	O
be	O
to	O
be	O
without	O
a	O
present	O
truthful	O
there	O
is	O
always	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
someone	O
out	O
there	O
that	O
likes	O
your	O
work	O
so	O
you	O
need	O
not	O
worry	O
about	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
absolutely	O
100	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
someone	O
out	O
there	O
somewhere	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
no	O
matter	O
what	O
your	O
skill	O
level	O
is	O
is	O
going	O
to	O

your	O
work	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
know	O
everybody	O
is	O
in	O
this	O
rat	O
race	O
to	O
become	O
super	O
popular	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
but	O
popularity	O
should	O
always	O
be	O
the	O
last	O
thing	O
you're	O
looking	O
for	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
art	O
and	O
why	O
I	O
say	O
that	O
is	O
because	O
if	O
you're	O
looking	O
to	O
be	O
popular	O
early	O
on	O
generally	O
it's	O
tide	O
to	O
something	O
else	O
you	O
know	O
generally	O
you're	O
tying	O
that	O
popularity	O
into	O
something	O
else	O
that	O
you	O
want	O
and	O
you	O
think	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
attain	O
it	O
without	O
popularity	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
that	O
with	O
tattooing	O
i've	O
been	O
tattooing	O
for	O
19	O
years	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
biggest	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
started	O
tattooing	O
was	O
popularity	O
and	O
it	O
wasn't	O
popularity	O
for	O
the	O
sake	O
of	O
being	O
popular	O

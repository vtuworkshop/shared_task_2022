it	O
at	O
all	O
or	O
do	O
a	O
different	O
kind	O
of	O
curl	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
makes	O
us	O
unique	O
in	O
art	O
which	O
basically	O
means	O
we	O
cannot	O
be	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
of	O
artist	O
because	O
we	O
don't	O
think	O
the	O

we	O
haven't	O
been	O
through	O
the	O
same	O
experiences	O
we	O
haven't	O
climbed	O
the	O
same	O
hurdles	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
us	O
haven't	O
even	O
had	O
some	O
hurdles	O
that	O
we	O
will	O
have	O
an	O
art	O
there's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
people	O
experience	O
that	O
other	O
people	O
haven't	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
they	O
may	O
or	O
may	O
not	O
ever	O
experience	O
and	O
that's	O
the	O
thing	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
just	O
don't	O
necessarily	O
get	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
art	O
is	O
the	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
you	O
keep	O
trying	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
like	O
someone	O
else	O
the	O
less	O
and	O
less	O
and	O
less	O
you	O
spend	O
trying	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
like	O
yourself	O
you	O
should	O
spend	O
10	O
times	O
more	O
time	O
trying	O
to	O
become	O
the	O
artist	O
that	O
you	O
are	O
intended	O
to	O
be	O
rather	O
than	O
trying	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
someone	O
else	O
are	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
someone	O
else	O
are	O
better	O
than	O
someone	O
else	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
being	O
an	O
artist	O
is	O
not	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
someone	O
else	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
that	O
age	O
old	O
concept	O
that	O
people	O
think	O
is	O
boring	O
that	O
you're	O
only	O
trying	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
person	O
you	O
were	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
meaning	O
when	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
to	O
draw	O
just	O
like	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
get	O
up	O
every	O
morning	O
and	O
I	O
practice	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
better	O
than	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
I	O
did	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
draw	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
and	O
every	O
year	O
I	O
always	O
take	O
one	O
day	O
off	O
of	O
drawing	O
and	O
after	O
that	O
one	O
day	O
off	O
of	O
drawing	O
I	O
start	O
over	O
and	O
I	O
re	O
evaluate	O
how	O
I	O
drew	O
stuff	O
the	O
year	O
before	O
so	O
like	O
I	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
test	O
sheet	O
that's	O
infinite	O
that	O
has	O
hands	O
and	O
feet	O
and	O
like	O
basic	O
facial	O
features	O
and	O
basic	O
human	O
anatomy	O
'cause	O
human	O
anatomy	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
always	O
struggle	O
to	O
be	O
better	O
at	O
so	O
that's	O
how	O
I	O
base	O
my	O
skill	O
set	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
I	O
start	O
over	O
those	O
are	O
the	O
first	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
that	O
I	O
start	O
working	O
on	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
start	O
over	O
is	O
ok	O
this	O
marks	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
my	O
yearly	O
journey	O
and	O
my	O
whatever	O
improvement	O
this	O
year	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
how	O
much	O
better	O
I	O
am	O
at	O
hands	O
in	O
a	O
year	O
before	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
add	O
anything	O
new	O
to	O
the	O
hands	O
that	O
I	O
draw	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
draw	O
you	O
know	O
faster	O
and	O
more	O
efficient	O
and	O
I	O
will	O
go	O
and	O
pull	O
up	O
my	O
old	O
test	O
sheets	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
will	O
draw	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
test	O
sheet	O
what	O
i've	O
learned	O
new	O
to	O
see	O
what	O
is	O
mixed	O
what	O
is	O
new	O
versus	O
old	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
my	O
test	O
sheets	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
of	O
like	O
faces	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
so	O
like	O
where's	O
my	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
complete	O
my	O
complete	O
female	O
face	O
thingy	O
or	O
whatever	O
where	O
is	O
it	O
complete	O
complete	O
face	O
guide	O
for	O
females	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
complete	O
phase	O
guide	O
for	O
females	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
what	O
I	O
had	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
hair	O
on	O
here	O
or	O
very	O
little	O
hair	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
basically	O
if	O
somebody	O
wanted	O
a	O
quick	O
reference	O
as	O
to	O
how	O
I	O
draw	O
female	O
faces	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
use	O
the	O
thing	O
is	O
is	O
everything	O
over	O
here	O
is	O
old	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
oldest	O
this	O
is	O
newer	O
and	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
newer	O
and	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
newest	O
as	O
I	O
started	O
getting	O
better	O
my	O
facial	O
structure	O
or	O
the	O
features	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
drew	O
the	O
faces	O
started	O
getting	O
simpler	O
you	O
know	O
these	O
I	O
don't	O
necessarily	O
draw	O
my	O
face	O
is	O
or	O
draw	O
them	O
like	O
this	O
anymore	O
it's	O
still	O
silas	O
still	O
similar	O
but	O
I	O
would	O
choose	O
different	O
stuff	O
for	O
the	O
different	O
hairstyles	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
plus	O
now	O
this	O
is	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
extent	O
of	O
my	O
hair	O
study	O
from	O
last	O
year	O
ok	O
this	O
is	O
literally	O
all	O
I	O
ever	O
drew	O
and	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
my	O
references	O
for	O
the	O
year	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
when	O
it	O
was	O
about	O
studying	O
her	O
this	O
was	O
it	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
2020	O
her	O
study	O
just	O
as	O
her	O
study	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
long	O
hair	O
is	O
literally	O
six	O
times	O
bigger	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
long	O
hair	O
this	O
was	O
my	O
hair	O
study	O
completely	O
long	O
short	O
bald	O
this	O
was	O
it	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
I	O
would	O
reference	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
draw	O
hair	O
and	O
to	O
study	O
here	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
reference	O
for	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
2020	O
and	O
2021	O
until	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
another	O
one	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
will	O
expand	O
on	O
this	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
just	O
be	O
infinitely	O
expanding	O
the	O
better	O
I	O
get	O
at	O
doing	O
whatever	O
I	O
do	O
the	O
minute	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
I'm	O
better	O
I	O
I	O
compare	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
to	O
what	O
I	O
learned	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
just	O
share	O
it	O
it's	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
with	O
eyes	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
like	O
I	O
have	O

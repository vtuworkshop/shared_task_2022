explain	O
in	O
more	O
detail	O
how	O
I	O
do	O
what	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
how	O
you	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
general	O
how	O

it	O
because	O
I	O
can't	O
explain	O
you	O
how	O
you	O
do	O
it	O
in	O
general	O
'cause	O
it's	O
different	O
for	O
everybody	O
you	O
know	O
generalization	O
in	O
art	O
is	O
good	O
and	O
bad	O

is	O
where	O
I'm	O
at	O
with	O
like	O
head	O
position	O
studies	O
where	O
it's	O
like	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
to	O
where	O
everything	O
I	O
do	O
is	O
is	O
broken	O
down	O
into	O
a	O
few	O
keystrokes	O
like	O
this	O
it	O
just	O
a	O
few	O
keystrokes	O
work	O
now	O
I'm	O
digital	O
again	O
this	O
is	O
all	O
in	O
the	O
three	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
almost	O
four	O
years	O
like	O
process	O
i've	O
only	O
been	O
digitally	O
drawing	O
for	O
four	O
years	O
digitally	O
coloring	O
digitally	O
anything	O
for	O
about	O
four	O
years	O
before	O
that	O
I	O
did	O
nothing	O
digital	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
traditional	O
i've	O
swore	O
away	O
from	O
digital	O
always	O
like	O
screw	O
that	O
digital	O
is	O
not	O
for	O
me	O
fun	O
fact	O
well	O
when	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
stream	O
on	O
the	O
adobe	O
channel	O
before	O
it	O
became	O
be	O
hands	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
do	O
digital	O
I	O
was	O
100	O
traditional	O
on	O
the	O
adobe	O
channel	O
which	O
everybody	O
was	O
blown	O
away	O
by	O
that	O
because	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
always	O
think	O
that	O
adobe	O
was	O
about	O
selling	O
adobe	O
products	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
no	O
they	O
they	O
told	O
us	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
about	O
art	O
you	O
know	O
do	O
what	O
you	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
like	O
they're	O
going	O
to	O
actually	O
let	O
me	O
draw	O
traditional	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
this	O
company	O
is	O
widely	O
known	O
for	O
doing	O
digital	O
programming	O
I	O
thought	O
that	O
was	O
like	O
the	O
coolest	O
move	O
ever	O
you	O
know	O
now	O
my	O
friend	O
to	O
senseless	O
was	O
also	O
a	O
behance	O
streamer	O
and	O
you	O
guys	O
definitely	O
should	O
check	O
her	O
out	O
she	O
saw	O
that	O
all	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
wasn't	O
drawing	O
digital	O
was	O
because	O
I	O
didn't	O
have	O
a	O
pencil	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
love	O
my	O
pencil	O
I	O
use	O
one	O
pencil	O
for	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
my	O
likable	O
art	O
karere	O
my	O
I	O
still	O
have	O
my	O
pencil	O
my	O

first	O
born	O
child	O

exact	O
same	O
at	O
pencil	O
I	O
used	O
one	O
pencil	O
one	O
brand	O
of	O
pencil	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
graph	O
gear	O
now	O
my	O
mind	O
you	O
that	O
graph	O
gear	O
is	O
the	O
graph	O
gear	O
like	O
pencil	O
or	O
whatever	O
is	O
just	O
a	O
pencil	O
it	O
just	O
felt	O
comfortable	O
in	O
my	O
hands	O
it	O
wasn't	O
the	O
pencil	O
did	O
make	O
me	O
draw	O
better	O
is	O
just	O
I	O
was	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
person	O
where	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
comfortable	O
with	O
my	O
equipment	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
use	O
that	O
same	O
equipment	O
and	O
I	O
just	O
didn't	O
like	O
changing	O
and	O
four	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
given	O
to	O
me	O
by	O
my	O
best	O
friend	O
my	O
best	O
friend	O
bought	O
it	O
for	O
me	O
as	O
a	O
birthday	O
present	O
and	O
I	O
treasured	O
it	O
an	O
I	O
literally	O
would	O
not	O
use	O
another	O
pencil	O
that	O
pencil	O
cost	O
me	O
$60.00	O
when	O
it	O
first	O
came	O
out	O
now	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
it	O
for	O
six	O
but	O
that	O
pencil	O
was	O
very	O
very	O
very	O
unique	O
to	O
me	O
i've	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
stories	O
based	O
around	O
that	O
pencil	O
I	O
remember	O
one	O
time	O
I	O
like	O
lossed	O
it	O
because	O
my	O
girlfriends	O
friends	O
came	O
over	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
we're	O
hanging	O
out	O
at	O

house	O
and	O
I	O

didn't	O
like	O
these	O
these	O
frames	O
or	O
or	O
whatnot	O
and	O
then	O

over	O
and	O
they	O
would	O
hang	O
out	O
at	O
the	O
house	O
and	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
just	O
decided	O
to	O
pick	O
up	O
my	O
pencil	O
and	O
use	O
it	O
to	O
write	O
something	O
and	O
then	O
keep	O
it	O
and	O
if	O
you're	O
not	O
an	O
artist	O
you	O
don't	O
understand	O
the	O
significance	O
of	O
artists	O

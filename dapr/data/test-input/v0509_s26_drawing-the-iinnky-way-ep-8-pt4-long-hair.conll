and	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
pretty	O
my	O
pencil	O
right	O
now	O
like	O
right	O
now	O
is	O
this	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
like	O
910	O
at	O
night	O
so	O
she	O
had	O
to	O
drive	O
all	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
the	O
house	O
there	O
bring	O
me	O
back	O
my	O
pencil	O
and	O
then	O
from	O
that	O
point	O
on	O
I	O
never	O
left	O
my	O
pencil	O
on	O
my	O
desk	O
it	O
was	O
always	O
somewhere	O
hidden	O
because	O
I	O
didn't	O
trust	O
my	O
girlfriends	O
friends	O
or	O
my	O
girlfriend	O
to	O
watch	O
my	O
stuff	O
because	O
she	O
didn't	O
care	O
about	O
art	O
like	O
I	O
cared	O
about	O
it	O
she	O
just	O
wasn't	O
into	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
to	O
anybody	O
that's	O
not	O
into	O
it's	O
something	O
that	O
I	O
learned	O
growing	O
up	O
is	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
always	O
understand	O
that	O
people	O
don't	O
care	O
about	O
things	O
the	O
same	O
way	O
you	O
care	O
about	O
them	O
if	O
they	O
don't	O
share	O
the	O
same	O
interest	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
if	O
you're	O
an	O
artist	O
and	O
there	O
not	O
an	O
artist	O
they	O
don't	O
really	O
care	O
about	O
art	O
and	O
they	O
don't	O
really	O
care	O
to	O
hear	O
about	O
art	O
and	O
it	O
it	O
really	O
it	O
really	O
sucks	O
when	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
get	O
someone	O
that	O
you	O
care	O
about	O
to	O
be	O
interested	O
in	O
something	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
and	O
they	O
just	O
literally	O
aren't	O
interested	O
in	O
it	O
it	O
goes	O
both	O
ways	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
'cause	O
9	O
times	O
outta	O
10	O
year	O

but	O
when	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
equipment	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
someone	O
if	O
someone	O
misplaces	O

it's	O
just	O
a	O
pencil	O

just	O
that	O
you	O

like	O
for	O
artists	O
like	O
you	O
bond	O
with	O
your	O
equipment	O
like	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
it's	O
just	O
like	O
no	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
just	O
a	O
pencil	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
would	O
always	O
I	O
would	O
always	O
tell	O
mikey	O
is	O
like	O
this	O
pencil	O
is	O
like	O
my	O
this	O
is	O
like	O
my	O
soul	O
mate	O
this	O
pencil	O
understands	O
me	O
this	O
pencil	O
actually	O
helps	O
me	O
make	O
money	O
this	O
pencil	O
goes	O
along	O
with	O
everything	O
that	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
never	O
questions	O
anything	O
that	O
I	O
do	O
like	O
everything	O
that	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
like	O
this	O
pencil	O
is	O
my	O
soul	O
mate	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
it's	O
basically	O
paid	O
his	O
weight	O
in	O
gold	O
you	O
know	O
it's	O
like	O
this	O
pencil	O
basically	O
made	O
it	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
raise	O
my	O
children	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
do	O
all	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
it's	O
crazy	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
it	O
but	O
now	O
my	O
best	O
friend	O
or	O
my	O
my	O
friend	O
to	O
senseless	O
she	O
knew	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
she	O
knew	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
pencil	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
about	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
didn't	O
use	O
any	O
other	O
tools	O
so	O
she	O
took	O
it	O
upon	O
herself	O
which	O
she	O
didn't	O
have	O
too	O
and	O
made	O
me	O
the	O
breast	O
should	O
I	O
use	O
and	O
this	O
brushes	O
and	O
irritable	O
brush	O
it	O
works	O
exactly	O
like	O
my	O
graph	O
gear	O
1000	O
all	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
was	O
change	O
the	O
color	O
that	O
it	O
it	O
'cause	O
whenever	O
when	O
she	O
gave	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
a	O
rd	O
in	O
it	O
wrote	O
in	O
a	O
graphite	O
like	O
gray	O
and	O
I	O
ws	O
graffi	O
I	O
hate	O
graphite	O
I	O
just	O
can't	O
stand	O
graffi	O
it	O
just	O
makes	O
my	O
heart	O
look	O
boring	O
and	O
that's	O
the	O
only	O
reason	O
why	O
I	O
draw	O
on	O
blue	O
I	O
know	O
there's	O
reasons	O
why	O
people	O
drawn	O
blue	O
but	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
I	O
draw	O
in	O
blue	O
is	O
literally	O
because	O
I	O
just	O
don't	O
like	O
like	O
it	O
doesn't	O
make	O
my	O
heart	O
look	O
interesting	O
when	O
I	O
draw	O
it	O
any	O
other	O
way	O
to	O
me	O
you	O
know	O
now	O
now	O
ironically	O
I	O
do	O
change	O
it	O
to	O
gray	O
after	O
I	O
draw	O
it	O
it's	O
just	O
fun	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
draw	O
it	O
in	O
blue	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
change	O
it	O
to	O
that	O
graphite	O
grey	O
afterwards	O
so	O
there's	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
there	O
is	O
that	O
alright	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
yeah	O
but	O
you	O
know	O
hum	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
started	O
drawing	O
on	O
I	O
started	O
drawing	O
digitally	O
after	O
I	O
got	O
this	O
pencil	O
up	O
until	O
that	O
point	O
I	O
only	O
colored	O
digitally	O
I	O
didn't	O
I	O
didn't	O
I	O
would	O
draw	O
traditional	O
scan	O
it	O
in	O
and	O
then	O
ink	O
over	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
it	O
uh	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
decided	O
I	O
just	O
wanted	O
to	O
draw	O
and	O
then	O
once	O
I	O
started	O
drawing	O
I	O
stop	O
drawing	O
on	O
paper	O
I	O
still	O
drawn	O
skin	O
'cause	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
tattoo	O
artist	O
so	O
I	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
that's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
forever	O
but	O
it's	O
a	O
different	O
type	O
of	O
media	O
than	O
just	O
drawing	O
on	O
paper	O
their	O
main	O
reason	O
why	O
I	O
started	O
loving	O
drawing	O
digitally	O
on	O
paper	O

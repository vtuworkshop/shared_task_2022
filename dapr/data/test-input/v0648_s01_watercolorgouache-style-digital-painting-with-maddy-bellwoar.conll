use	O
this	O
today	O
to	O
put	O
our	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O
that	O
will	O
be	O
working	O
in	O
for	O
the	O
painting	O
so	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
keep	O
an	O
eye	O
on	O
that	O
and	O
hopefully	O
not	O
go	O
over	O
the	O
time	O
alright	O
well	O
let's	O
get	O
started	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
put	O
the	O
reference	O
over	O
on	O
my	O
other	O
monitor	O
next	O
to	O
chat	O
but	O
I	O
will	O
keep	O
a	O
little	O
mini	O
version	O
up	O
here	O
this	O
is	O
using	O
pure	O
rough	O
there's	O
a	O
link	O
to	O
that	O
below	O
the	O
stream	O
in	O
the	O
description	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
it's	O
a	O
separate	O
program	O
a	O
separate	O
app	O
but	O
it's	O
really	O
handy	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
windows	O
hovering	O
over	O
photo	O
shop	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
look	O
a	O
little	O
reference	O
up	O
there	O
something	O
so	O
I'm	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
save	O
my	O
my	O
canvas	O
and	O
let's	O
call	O
this	O
tree	O
stump	O
watercolor	O
studies	O
I	O
have	O
some	O
ideas	O
on	O
how	O
I	O
will	O
try	O
to	O
do	O
this	O
so	O
we'll	O
see	O
how	O
it	O
goes	O
and	O
let's	O
check	O
our	O
image	O
size	O
so	O
my	O
canvas	O
size	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
size	O
as	O
the	O
reference	O
image	O
which	O
was	O
1132	O
by	O
7:50	O
I	O
think	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
my	O
canvas	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
bigger	O
let's	O
go	O
with	O
2500	O
pixels	O
by	O
1656	O
have	O
the	O
little	O
lock	O
here	O
so	O
it	O
just	O
made	O
it	O
proportionately	O
larger	O
so	O
I	O
made	O
the	O
width	O
of	O
2500	O
pixels	O
so	O
that's	O
a	O
pretty	O
decent	O
size	O
especially	O
for	O
if	O
I'm	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
posting	O
it	O
online	O
I	O
even	O
could	O
make	O
like	O
a	O
small	O
print	O
from	O
this	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
fine	O
but	O
usually	O
these	O
are	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
digital	O
bees	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
remain	O
in	O
the	O
digital	O
world	O
so	O
all	O
right	O
I	O
think	O
that's	O
everything	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
set	O
up	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
any	O
questions	O
feel	O
free	O
to	O
ask	O
how	O
my	O
goal	O
but	O
yeah	O
I	O
hope	O
you	O
guys	O
will	O
join	O
me	O
for	O
a	O
quick	O
sketch	O
if	O
you're	O
in	O
the	O
mood	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
painting	O
and	O
all	O
right	O
we've	O
got	O
the	O
timer	O
on	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
put	O
2	O
1/2	O
hours	O
this	O
is	O
like	O
a	O
maximum	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
happy	O
if	O
I	O
finish	O
this	O
earlier	O
'cause	O
then	O
we	O
can	O
maybe	O
squeeze	O
in	O
three	O
more	O
paint	O
two	O
more	O
paintings	O
after	O
this	O
but	O
we'll	O
see	O
but	O
I'm	O
gonna	O
put	O
this	O
2	O
hours	O
and	O
30	O
minutes	O
is	O
a	O
maximum	O
time	O
and	O
i'll	O
just	O
keep	O
an	O
eye	O
on	O
it	O
as	O
we're	O
going	O
so	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
start	O
with	O
a	O
sketch	O
actually	O
the	O
very	O
first	O
thing	O
i'll	O
do	O
almost	O
forgot	O
is	O
i'll	O
put	O
a	O
gray	O
paint	O
bucket	O
'cause	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
less	O
harsh	O
on	O
the	O
eyes	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
that	O
background	O
not	O
bright	O
white	O
so	O
will	O
do	O
that	O
to	O
start	O
with	O
and	O
now	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
sketch	O
a	O
brush	O
and	O
just	O
begin	O
planning	O
out	O
the	O
main	O
composition	O
here	O
and	O
so	O
we've	O
got	O
a	O
little	O
tree	O
stump	O
I	O
know	O
this	O
reference	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
tiny	O
bit	O
lackluster	O
at	O
first	O
but	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
we	O
could	O
turn	O
this	O
into	O
a	O
really	O
whimsical	O
kind	O
of	O
setting	O
you	O
know	O
oh	O
thank	O
you	O
thank	O
you	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
focus	O
on	O
the	O
textures	O
but	O
colors	O
the	O
gradients	O
so	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
I	O
noticed	O
was	O
in	O
watercolor	O
and	O
gouache	O
atwater	O
medium	O
in	O
general	O
is	O
the	O
the	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
some	O
really	O
nice	O
blends	O
soft	O
gradients	O
from	O
one	O
color	O
the	O
next	O
where	O
you	O
don't	O
always	O
have	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
hard	O
edge	O
the	O
referent	O
looks	O
like	O
a	O
tiny	O
diorama	O
tree	O
phillip	O
I	O
could	O
see	O
what	O
you're	O
saying	O
I	O
think	O
there's	O
something	O
a	O
little	O
funky	O
with	O
the	O
camera	O
what	O
would	O
you	O
call	O
it	O
like	O
the	O
field	O
depth	O
of	O
field	O
the	O
way	O
it's	O
focused	O
it	O
does	O
make	O
it	O
look	O
like	O
it's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
tiny	O
little	O
world	O
let	O
me	O
get	O
something	O
about	O
the	O
the	O
focus	O
and	O
yeah	O
maybe	O
that's	O
one	O
more	O
reason	O
that	O
it	O
gave	O
me	O
this	O
little	O
magical	O
fairy	O
land	O
kind	O
of	O
feeling	O
so	O
it's	O
a	O
tree	O
stump	O
without	O
roots	O
coming	O
out	O
to	O
the	O
side	O
I	O
like	O
these	O
over	O
here	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
can	O
add	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
if	O
we	O
want	O
this	O
would	O
be	O
such	O
a	O
cool	O
seem	O
to	O
add	O
maybe	O
some	O
mushrooms	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
little	O
mushrooms	O
on	O
the	O
side	O
here	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
cute	O
alright	O
so	O
i've	O
like	O
over	O
here	O
on	O
the	O
left	O
there's	O
a	O
little	O
puddle	O
maybe	O
this	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
edge	O
of	O
a	O
like	O
a	O
pond	O
or	O
lake	O
or	O
something	O
or	O
maybe	O
it's	O
just	O
rained	O
and	O
there's	O
some	O
water	O
collecting	O
here	O
going	O
to	O
try	O
being	O
braves	O
andy	O
go	O
for	O
it	O
I'm	O
proud	O
of	O
you	O
I	O
know	O
this	O
one's	O
a	O
little	O
different	O
it's	O
not	O
quite	O
a	O
landscape	O
environment	O
study	O
but	O
I	O
guess	O
it	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
landscape	O
it's	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
zoomed	O
in	O
on	O
the	O
little	O
portion	O
of	O
1	O
something	O
different	O
and	O
then	O
there's	O
these	O
little	O
areas	O
of	O
moss	O
an	O
I	O
really	O
like	O
how	O
it	O
looks	O

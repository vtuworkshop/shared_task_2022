it's	O
a	O
bit	O
neon	O
and	O
color	O
compared	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
the	O
grass	O
is	O
and	O
it's	O
really	O
really	O
soft	O
looking	O
thank	O
you	O
you	O
look	O
like	O
you	O
could	O
just	O
touch	O
it	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
like	O
velvet	O
or	O
something	O
but	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
there's	O
enough	O
water	O
I	O
might	O
actually	O
exaggerate	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
room	O
for	O
the	O
water	O
over	O
there	O
because	O
I	O
really	O
like	O
the	O
reflections	O
little	O
shadows	O
of	O
the	O
grass	O
is	O
coming	O
up	O
kahoma	O
thank	O
you	O
welcome	O
so	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
I'm	O
using	O
the	O
transform	O
tools	O
a	O
bit	O
i'll	O
just	O
grab	O
this	O
lasso	O
here	O
freehand	O
lasso	O
make	O
a	O
selection	O
of	O
an	O
area	O
if	O
I	O
happened	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
I	O
don't	O
really	O
like	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
modify	O
it	O
that	O
way	O
I	O
do	O
this	O
a	O
lot	O
during	O
my	O
sketches	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
there's	O
no	O
shame	O
in	O
it	O
some	O
added	O
mushrooms	O
would	O
be	O
cool	O
oh	O
thank	O
you	O
thank	O
you	O
yeah	O
I	O
like	O
this	O
seems	O
like	O
a	O
good	O
place	O
that	O
have	O
mushrooms	O
like	O
very	O
watery	O
damp	O
looking	O
place	O
and	O
i've	O
noticed	O
you	O
know	O
tree	O
stumps	O
we	O
often	O
see	O
mushrooms	O
collecting	O
it's	O
good	O
'cause	O
it	O
feels	O
less	O
overwhelming	O
awesome	O
yeah	O
sometimes	O
a	O
big	O
seems	O
like	O
mountains	O
trees	O
house	O
all	O
that	O
stuff	O
is	O
like	O
who	O
I	O
like	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
work	O
my	O
way	O
up	O
to	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
first	O
started	O
doing	O
landscapes	O
I	O
tried	O
to	O
pick	O
something	O
more	O
calm	O
like	O
a	O
field	O
sky	O
maybe	O
a	O
tree	O
or	O
two	O
but	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
work	O
your	O
way	O
up	O
to	O
some	O
other	O
ideas	O
the	O
next	O
one	O
after	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
a	O
bit	O
more	O
intense	O
but	O
uh	O
that's	O
what	O
I'm	O
hoping	O
that	O
this	O
one	O
will	O
get	O
me	O
sort	O
of	O
warmed	O
up	O
and	O
then	O
that	O
one	O
won't	O
be	O
so	O
it	O
won't	O
be	O
so	O
hard	O
will	O
see	O
alright	O
so	O
in	O
fact	O
grass	O
is	O
creating	O
this	O
little	O
like	O
dome	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
in	O
the	O
background	O
and	O
then	O
in	O
the	O
foreground	O
here	O
we've	O
got	O
grass	O
is	O
coming	O
up	O
more	O
I	O
think	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
bring	O
this	O
down	O
will	O
change	O
the	O
proportions	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
the	O
suit	O
well	O
we	O
think	O
looks	O
cool	O
and	O
then	O
grass	O
is	O
and	O
stuff	O
coming	O
up	O
here	O
so	O
I'm	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
draw	O
them	O
in	O
'cause	O
I	O
think	O
will	O
do	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
painting	O
process	O
but	O
I	O
should	O
work	O
great	O
how	O
are	O
we	O
composition	O
wise	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
check	O
on	O
composition	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
I	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
go	O
to	O
few	O
knew	O
guide	O
layout	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
set	O
the	O
columns	O
and	O
rows	O
2	O
three	O
and	O
it	O
pops	O
up	O
a	O
like	O
a	O
rule	O
of	O
thirds	O
grid	O
so	O
I	O
tried	O
to	O
arrange	O
the	O
tree	O
stump	O
on	O
1/3	O
hey	O
jackson	O
I'm	O
so	O
happy	O
like	O
the	O
references	O
I	O
went	O
for	O
watercolor	O
gouache	O
kind	O
of	O
give	O
me	O
s	O
work	O
today	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
along	O
today	O
but	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
challenge	O
myself	O
with	O
colors	O
my	O
everybody	O
so	O
skill	O
good	O
luck	O
judy	O
that	O
sounds	O
good	O
that	O
sounds	O
good	O
so	O
ok	O
I	O
think	O
I'm	O
ok	O
with	O
the	O
composition	O
so	O
will	O
hide	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
put	O
my	O
sketch	O
layer	O
on	O
multiply	O
mode	O
and	O
lower	O
the	O
opacity	O
so	O
we	O
can	O
just	O
barely	O
see	O
it	O
but	O
it	O
will	O
help	O
guide	O
us	O
and	O
then	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
lock	O
that	O
layer	O
all	O
right	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
where	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
moment	O
so	O
I	O
haven't	O
done	O
this	O
before	O
but	O
what	O
I'm	O
really	O
going	O
to	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
really	O
go	O
for	O
like	O
a	O
watercolor	O
kind	O
of	O
look	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
i've	O
been	O
trying	O
to	O
practice	O
with	O
my	O
in	O
my	O
traditional	O
art	O
is	O
like	O
combining	O
watercolor	O
and	O
gouache	O
an	O
really	O
into	O
those	O
textures	O
and	O
mediums	O
right	O
now	O
so	O
I	O
thought	O
in	O
digital	O
would	O
be	O
fun	O
to	O
try	O
so	O
I'm	O
thinking	O
I	O
can	O
do	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
watercolor	O
e	O
gradient	O
in	O
the	O
background	O
get	O
it	O
smoothed	O
radiation	O
from	O
this	O
blue	O
you	O
see	O
up	O
here	O
in	O
the	O
further	O
away	O
background	O
to	O
get	O
like	O
this	O
blue	O
teal	O
color	O
and	O
then	O
all	O
these	O
greens	O
so	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
relatively	O
smooth	O
gradient	O
through	O
there	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
can	O
add	O
we	O
can	O
paint	O
on	O
top	O
in	O
a	O
more	O
opaque	O
so	O
let's	O
see	O
through	O
type	O
of	O
style	O
and	O
then	O
hopefully	O
it's	O
going	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
watercolor	O
and	O
gouache	O
well	O
it	O
will	O
at	O
least	O
be	O
inspired	O
by	O
that	O
so	O
I	O
have	O
some	O
watercolor	O
brushes	O
that	O
I	O
created	O
in	O
my	O
ghibli	O
inspired	O
brush	O
pack	O
there's	O
a	O
link	O
to	O
that	O
below	O
the	O
stream	O
in	O
the	O
description	O
but	O
don't	O
feel	O
like	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
buy	O
anything	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
adobe	O
subscription	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
the	O
creative	O
cloud	O
subscription	O
for	O
photo	O
shop	O
or	O
any	O
of	O
the	O
programs	O
actually	O
but	O
well	O
we're	O
using	O

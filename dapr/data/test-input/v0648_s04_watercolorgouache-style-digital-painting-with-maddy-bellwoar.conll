a	O
link	O
below	O
my	O

little	O
paragraph	O
down	O
there	O
there's	O
a	O
link	O
in	O
a	O
discount	O
code	O
for	O
this	O
plugin	O
that	O
I'm	O
using	O
for	O
the	O
color	O
wheel	O
it's	O
called	O
coulouris	O
an	O
it's	O
a	O
separate	O
plugin	O
however	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
photo	O
shop	O
cc	O
2019	O
or	O
any	O
more	O
recent	O
versions	O
of	O
photo	O
shop	O
then	O
you	O
should	O
have	O
something	O
similar	O
available	O
for	O
you	O
in	O
photoshop	O
automatically	O
if	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
view	O
actually	O
it's	O
under	O
window	O
window	O
color	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
triangle	O
color	O
wheel	O
like	O
this	O
now	O
available	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
hue	O
cube	O
that	O
was	O
I	O
think	O
the	O
default	O
so	O
now	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
to	O
these	O
menu	O
up	O
here	O
and	O
go	O
to	O
color	O
wheel	O
so	O
this	O
doesn't	O
have	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
same	O
tools	O
as	O
cool	O
riskless	O
has	O
some	O
gamut	O
masks	O
and	O
other	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
nice	O
to	O
have	O
but	O
if	O
you're	O
just	O
looking	O
for	O
the	O
triangle	O
format	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
to	O
window	O
color	O
an	O
select	O
it	O
from	O
the	O
settings	O
here	O
some	O
might	O
be	O
what	O
you're	O
looking	O
for	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
this	O
plugin	O
yeah	O
the	O
links	O
the	O
link	O
is	O
below	O
in	O
the	O
description	O
and	O
don't	O
forget	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
coupon	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
but	O
I	O
like	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O
I	O
bought	O
it	O
before	O
the	O
photoshop	O
version	O
was	O
updated	O
to	O
have	O
before	O
it	O
was	O
updated	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
triangle	O
I	O
prefer	O
that	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
some	O
darker	O
colors	O
right	O
at	O
this	O
area	O
where	O
the	O
water	O
and	O
the	O
land	O
meet	O
up	O
there's	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
muddy	O
area	O
and	O
I	O
don't	O
want	O
everybody	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
have	O
is	O
muddy	O
colors	O
but	O
I	O
do	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
look	O
like	O
mud	O
so	O
that's	O
kind	O
of	O
puzzle	O
but	O
we've	O
got	O
some	O
darker	O
shadows	O
and	O
what	O
I	O
tend	O
to	O
like	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
stick	O
to	O
like	O
purple	O
and	O
blue	O
in	O
shadows	O
when	O
I'm	O
painting	O
especially	O
if	O
it's	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
environment	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
blues	O
and	O
greens	O
so	O
let's	O
try	O
this	O
so	O
again	O
I'm	O
going	O
for	O
a	O
watercolor	O
kind	O
of	O
look	O
so	O
far	O
i've	O
been	O
painting	O
all	O
in	O
one	O
layer	O
I	O
will	O
not	O
that	O
smart	O
but	O
I	O
like	O
to	O
paint	O
I	O
generally	O
like	O
to	O
paint	O
a	O
midtones	O
first	O
so	O
i've	O
been	O
trying	O
to	O
remember	O
you	O
know	O
hey	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
kind	O
of	O
need	O
to	O
start	O
light	O
and	O
then	O
go	O
darker	O
ahmed	O
the	O
how	O
I	O
pinned	O
this	O
image	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
it's	O
something	O
separate	O
from	O
photo	O
shop	O
it's	O
a	O
separate	O
app	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
download	O
and	O
the	O
link	O
to	O
it	O
is	O
also	O
below	O
a	O
stream	O
in	O
the	O
description	O
it's	O
called	O
pure	O
ref	O
pureref	O
and	O
it	O
is	O
free	O
to	O
download	O
I	O
think	O
you	O
can	O
make	O
a	O
donation	O
if	O
you	O
like	O
when	O
you	O
download	O
it	O
which	O
is	O
nice	O
but	O
yeah	O
the	O
link	O
is	O
below	O
the	O
stream	O
and	O
it's	O
very	O
handy	O
I	O
use	O
it	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
you	O
do	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
into	O
the	O
settings	O
and	O
make	O
sure	O
that	O
you	O
select	O
in	O
the	O
settings	O
for	O
it	O
to	O
put	O
the	O
window	O
always	O
on	O
top	O
once	O
you	O
select	O
that	O
then	O
it	O
will	O
do	O
that	O
but	O
the	O
default	O
won't	O
put	O
the	O
window	O
on	O
top	O
and	O
let's	O
you	O
go	O
in	O
there	O
and	O
tell	O
it	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
but	O
then	O
you're	O
good	O
to	O
go	O
so	O
we're	O
getting	O
into	O
or	O
maybe	O
getting	O
into	O
the	O
messy	O
stage	O
now	O
usually	O
when	O
a	O
painting	O
feels	O
like	O
this	O
to	O
me	O
it's	O
generally	O
because	O
i've	O
started	O
to	O
paint	O
in	O
darker	O
values	O
or	O
started	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
with	O
the	O
value	O
structure	O
so	O
putting	O
in	O
shading	O
where	O
I	O
haven't	O
yet	O
added	O
shading	O
everywhere	O
usually	O
that's	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
main	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
notice	O
whenever	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
my	O
paintings	O
in	O
that	O
ugly	O
stage	O
that's	O
usually	O
what's	O
going	O
on	O
so	O
things	O
that	O
things	O
need	O
to	O
become	O
balanced	O
and	O
right	O
now	O
there	O

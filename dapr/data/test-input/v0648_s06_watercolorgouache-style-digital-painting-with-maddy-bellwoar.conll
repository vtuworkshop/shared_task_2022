so	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
something	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
experiment	O
with	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
hypothesis	O
so	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
selection	O
and	O
fill	O
the	O
selection	O
in	O
if	O
you	O
use	O
the	O
lasso	O
tool	O
and	O
make	O
a	O
selection	O
your	O
edges	O
around	O
the	O
outside	O
that	O
selection	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
pretty	O
hard	O
so	O
for	O
example	O
if	O
I	O
deselect	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
the	O
hard	O
edges	O
around	O
that	O
so	O
what	O
you	O
can	O
do	O
is	O
use	O
feathering	O
so	O
if	O
I	O
have	O
the	O
last	O
central	O
selected	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
up	O
here	O
to	O
feather	O
and	O
put	O
a	O
certain	O
number	O
of	O
pixels	O
let's	O
try	O
5	O
I	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
just	O
a	O
slight	O
softness	O
so	O
now	O
if	O
you	O
fill	O
this	O
in	O
do	O
you	O
see	O
how	O
there's	O
sort	O
of	O
this	O
glow	O
effect	O
in	O
the	O
soft	O
edge	O
so	O
that's	O
actually	O
more	O
than	O
I	O
was	O
expecting	O
maybe	O
i'll	O
try	O
just	O
a	O
couple	O
pixels	O
I	O
want	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
soft	O
edge	O
let's	O
try	O
I	O
gotta	O
change	O
this	O
before	O
I	O
select	O
let's	O
try	O
to	O
just	O
make	O
a	O
random	O
shape	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
like	O
it	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
like	O
it	O
ok	O
so	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
selection	O
of	O
my	O
tree	O
stump	O
and	O
if	O
you	O
can't	O
be	O
your	O
sketch	O
anymore	O
and	O
you're	O
having	O
trouble	O
making	O
this	O
election	O
yeah	O
they	O
can	O
just	O
make	O
this	O
sketch	O
layer	O
more	O
opaque	O
god	O
jackson	O
thank	O
you	O
for	O
noticing	O
the	O
timer	O
cow	O
says	O
wolf's	O
been	O
working	O
on	O
this	O
it's	O
a	O
plugin	O
that	O
he's	O
looking	O
to	O
make	O
available	O
but	O
I'm	O
basically	O
the	O
beta	O
tester	O
right	O
now	O
so	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
I'm	O
using	O
it	O
on	O
on	O
stream	O
but	O
if	O
it's	O
if	O
it	O
all	O
works	O
out	O
well	O
or	O
after	O
we	O
troubleshoot	O
it	O
a	O
bit	O
it's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
available	O
yeah	O
for	O
just	O
it'll	O
be	O
it'll	O
be	O
a	O
low	O
low	O
price	O
for	O
it	O
but	O
it	O
will	O
be	O
available	O
for	O
anyone	O
who	O
is	O
interested	O
in	O
buying	O
it	O
but	O
yeah	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
nice	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
timer	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
use	O
here	O
when	O
I'm	O
streaming	O
on	O
v	O
hands	O
or	O
anytime	O
in	O
photo	O
shop	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
stop	O
watch	O
so	O
it	O
will	O
count	O
up	O
or	O
countdown	O
depending	O
on	O
what	O
you	O
look	O
what	O
you	O
like	O
now	O
this	O
is	O
unfortunately	O
I'm	O
recently	O
always	O
working	O
during	O
stream	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
only	O
say	O
hello	O
and	O
goodbye	O
oh	O
maybe	O
it'll	O
come	O
into	O
the	O
middle	O
but	O
always	O
listening	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
colors	O
in	O
the	O
reference	O
super	O
cozy	O
thank	O
you	O
madzia	O
I'm	O
glad	O
you	O
can	O
still	O
at	O
least	O
lyric	O
and	O
hang	O
out	O
with	O
us	O
even	O
though	O
you're	O
working	O
I	O
hope	O
your	O
work	O
goes	O
well	O
and	O
thanks	O
for	O
keeping	O
us	O
company	O
I	O
love	O
this	O
reference	O
too	O
I	O
hope	O
I	O
can	O
do	O
something	O
nice	O
with	O
it	O
in	O
the	O
painting	O
going	O
to	O
try	O
my	O
best	O
I	O
know	O
we	O
are	O
is	O
not	O
amazing	O
I	O
know	O
I'm	O
very	O
spoiled	O
really	O
ok	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
we've	O
made	O
the	O
whole	O
selection	O
if	O
you	O
guys	O
have	O
been	O
watching	O
me	O
select	O
this	O
i've	O
been	O
using	O
shift	O
to	O
add	O
to	O
the	O
selection	O
an	O
alt	O
to	O
subtract	O
from	O
it	O
thanks	O
claire	O
zi	O
appreciate	O
that	O
you	O
tried	O
to	O
design	O
it	O
to	O
fit	O
into	O
photo	O
shop	O
so	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
yeah	O
not	O
distracting	O
and	O
feel	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
feel	O
like	O
as	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
program	O
ok	O
so	O
we've	O
got	O
our	O
selection	O
let	O
me	O
just	O
pop	O
in	O
a	O
color	O
this	O
is	O
obviously	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
just	O
one	O
flat	O
colour	O
groups	O
on	O
the	O
new	O
layer	O
and	O
so	O
we've	O
got	O
one	O
flat	O
colour	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
this	O
mainly	O
just	O
to	O
have	O
the	O
selection	O
here	O
now	O
we	O
can	O
lock	O
the	O
selection	O
so	O
we've	O
got	O
our	O
shape	O
on	O
the	O
layer	O
we	O
can	O
press	O
the	O
checkerboard	O
icon	O
here	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
can	O
paint	O
whatever	O
we	O
want	O
it	O
will	O
only	O
allow	O
us	O
to	O
paint	O
within	O
that	O
shape	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
so	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
idea	O
when	O
I	O
sometimes	O
when	O
I	O
paint	O
in	O
watercolor	O
I	O
almost	O
get	O
the	O
feeling	O
that	O
I'm	O
working	O
with	O
clipping	O
masks	O
because	O
you'll	O
create	O
this	O
wet	O
area	O
on	O
the	O
paper	O
and	O
then	O
anything	O
you	O
paint	O
with	O
in	O
that	O
area	O
that	O
paint	O
will	O
spread	O
out	O
within	O
that	O
little	O
shape	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
water	O
tension	O
it	O
won't	O
escape	O
outside	O
of	O
that	O
shape	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
can	O
maybe	O
emulate	O
that	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
with	O
clipping	O
masks	O
or	O
locking	O
the	O
transparency	O
I	O
have	O
this	O
shape	O
here	O
an	O
I	O
can	O
paint	O
within	O
it	O
in	O
soft	O
gradients	O
and	O
just	O
keep	O
it	O
within	O
that	O
shape	O
anyway	O
let's	O
try	O
irs	O
isn't	O
working	O
too	O
sometimes	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
mute	O
but	O
generally	O
I'm	O
able	O
to	O
follow	O
stream	O
oh	O
I	O
know	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
day	O
for	O
some	O
people	O
it's	O
like	O
right	O
in	O
the	O
middle	O
of	O
birthday	O
so	O
I'm	O
sorry	O
but	O
I'm	O
glad	O
you're	O
still	O
here	O
talk	O
how	O
well	O
done	O
thank	O
you	O
foster	O

remastered	O
bundle	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
has	O
like	O
all	O
the	O
metal	O
gear	O
solid	O
games	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
play	O
on	O
the	O
ps3	O
yeah	O
like	O
snake	O
eater	O
and	O
yeah	O
I'm	O
see	O
I'm	O
typing	O
I'm	O
typing	O
stuff	O
up	O
here	O
typing	O
writing	O
a	O
little	O
gibberish	O
novel	O
up	O
there	O
in	O
the	O
menus	O
or	O
whatever	O
they're	O
called	O
ok	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
could	O
probably	O
hey	O
this	O
is	O
fine	O
this	O
is	O
fine	O
and	O
move	O
on	O
painting	O
actually	O
let's	O
flip	O
first	O
see	O
yeah	O
something	O
right	O
here	O
and	O
it's	O
usually	O
this	O
area	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
dumps	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
flip	O
now	O
let's	O
go	O
with	O
this	O
the	O
ps4	O
is	O
really	O
good	O
generation	O
for	O
ps3	O
did	O
I	O
say	O
ps3	O
yeah	O
I	O
meant	O
I	O
meant	O
say	O
ps3	O
here	O
three	O
with	O
a	O
late	O
on	O
it's	O
games	O
I	O
remember	O
right	O
like	O
not	O
latent	O
delivering	O
the	O
games	O
but	O
the	O
good	O
the	O
good	O
ones	O
came	O
out	O
much	O
later	O
in	O
the	O
cycle	O
of	O
that	O
console's	O
life	O
but	O
that's	O
that's	O
usually	O
that's	O
common	O
I	O
think	O
that's	O
common	O
is	O
the	O
best	O
games	O
come	O
either	O
at	O
the	O
very	O
beginning	O
like	O
with	O
the	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
bloodborne	O
was	O
released	O
on	O
ps4	O
came	O
out	O
but	O
it	O
came	O
up	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
release	O
of	O
the	O
console	O
right	O
then	O
the	O
end	O
at	O
and	O
workout	O
the	O
kinks	O
yeah	O
exactly	O
yeah	O
is	O
this	O
poetry	O
and	O
drama	O
derek	O
could	O
be	O
could	O
very	O
well	O
be	O
that	O
it's	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
tombs	O
the	O
jam	O
kind	O
of	O
chill	O
jazz	O
james	O
we	O
got	O
now	O
this	O
comes	O
down	O
lower	O
I	O
think	O
its	O
head	O
just	O
needs	O
to	O
drop	O
down	O
I	O
look	O
at	O
his	O
chin	O
and	O
where	O
it	O
is	O
connected	O
to	O
colour	O
right	O
it's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
down	O
there	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
just	O
need	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
bigger	O
maybe	O
that	O
instead	O
sir	O
alright	O
turn	O
that	O
back	O
on	O
and	O
off	O
and	O
maybe	O
we	O
should	O
draw	O
it	O
again	O
wonder	O
now	O
let's	O
just	O
go	O
for	O
it	O
since	O
this	O
feed	O
into	O
this	O
one	O
all	O
right	O
first	O
thing	O
we	O
do	O
let's	O
get	O
the	O
backgrounds	O
get	O
something	O
down	O
for	O
the	O
background	O
some	O
mud	O
what	O
color	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
saturation	O
just	O
do	O
this	O
walk	O
this	O
all	O
in	O
turn	O
the	O
line	O
layer	O
to	O
multiply	O

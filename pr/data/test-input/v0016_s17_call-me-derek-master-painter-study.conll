the	O

in	O
ri	O
right	O
or	O
or	O
it's	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
neuron	O
based	O
or	O
what	O
is	O
it	O
called	O
will	O
just	O
see	O
games	O
or	O
whatever	O
we	O
want	O
when	O
we	O
close	O
your	O
eyes	O
right	O
'cause	O
it	O
just	O
like	O
projected	O
into	O
our	O
brain	O
do	O
you	O
guys	O
ever	O
think	O
about	O
the	O
future	O
of	O
technology	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
entertainment	O
and	O
video	O
games	O
we're	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
while	O
I'm	O
playing	O
playstation	O
87	O
people	O
drooling	O
and	O
just	O
with	O
their	O
eyes	O
shut	O
it	O
will	O
become	O
that	O
movie	O
that	O
uh	O
movie	O
with	O
bruce	O
willis	O
in	O
it	O
what	O
was	O
that	O
movie	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
whatever	O
where	O
my	O
salasco	O
guys	O
oh	O
here	O
it	O
is	O
happens	O
once	O
a	O
day	O
sometimes	O
more	O
I	O
didn't	O
miss	O
place	O
it	O
somebody	O
stole	O
it	O
then	O
came	O
into	O
my	O
home	O
so	O
my	O
stylus	O
gone	O
forever	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
misplaced	O
my	O
stylus	O
yeah	O
let's	O
just	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
merge	O
all	O
that	O
down	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
could	O
just	O
the	O
eyes	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
control	O
j	O
not	O
quite	O
looking	O
at	O
us	O
but	O
that's	O
better	O
could	O
you	O
wake	O
on	O
products	O
won't	O
even	O
need	O
a	O
stylus	O
I	O
like	O
I	O
don't	O
even	O
know	O
if	O
we'll	O
need	O
artists	O
everything	O
just	O
be	O
like	O
synthesized	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
tell	O
it	O
you	O
tell	O
a	O
computer	O
imagine	O
physics	O
like	O
this	O
imagine	O
it	O
lives	O
in	O
an	O
environment	O
like	O
that	O
imagine	O
it	O
has	O
this	O
dynamics	O
and	O
boom	O
how	O
many	O
limbs	O
you	O
just	O
fill	O
out	O
this	O
chart	O
and	O
it	O
creates	O
it	O
for	O
you	O
right	O
hopefully	O
not	O
hopefully	O
it	O
never	O
comes	O
so	O
I	O
guess	O
if	O
everything	O
is	O
automated	O
then	O
who's	O
making	O
money	O
I	O
guess	O
the	O
people	O
who	O
obviously	O
owned	O
the	O
automation	O
the	O
robots	O
or	O
whatever	O
a	O
eyes	O
creating	O
everything	O
so	O
they're	O
getting	O
rich	O
but	O
how	O
would	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
my	O
brain	O
hurts	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
figure	O
this	O
out	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
tackle	O
this	O
issue	O
yo	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
watching	O
the	O
stream	O
in	O
the	O
sky	O
totally	O
figured	O
out	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O
is	O
the	O
singularity	O
when	O
when	O
computers	O
start	O
taking	O
over	O
this	O
one	O
guy	O
in	O
the	O
internet	O
you	O
figured	O
it	O
out	O
hopefully	O
hopefully	O
he	O
made	O
a	O
pot	O
of	O
it	O
'cause	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
might	O
be	O
gone	O
do	O
that	O
mustache	O
so	O
we	O
got	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
light	O
gray	O
and	O
green's	O
down	O
here	O
all	O
this	O
fun	O
stuff	O
down	O
here	O
fix	O
this	O
I	O
somehow	O
will	O
worry	O
about	O
that	O
later	O
the	O
yellow	O
in	O
there	O

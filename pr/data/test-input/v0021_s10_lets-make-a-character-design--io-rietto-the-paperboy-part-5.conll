part	O
one	O
and	O
part	O
2	O
we	O
that	O
we	O
conceptualize	O
we	O
decided	O

we	O
are	O
developing	O
and	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O

presentation	O
and	O
of	O
course	O
I	O
practice	O
it	O

in	O
spanish	O
so	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
have	O
to	O
practice	O
that	O
mad	O
language	O
so	O
it	O
wasn't	O
that	O
hard	O
because	O
I	O
actually	O
love	O
and	O
esteem	O
about	O
about	O
a	O
conceptual	O
concept	O
in	O
and	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O
so	O
yeah	O

they	O
must	O
have	O
left	O

was	O
very	O
good	O
people	O
really	O

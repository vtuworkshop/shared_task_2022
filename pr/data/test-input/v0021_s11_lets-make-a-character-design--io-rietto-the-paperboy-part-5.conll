I	O
think	O
it's	O
called	O
ok	O
I	O
totally	O
forgot	O
about	O
the	O
clock	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
to	O
give	O
the	O
clock	O
some	O
shadowing	O
after	O
all	O
look	O
how	O
amazed	O
they	O
need	O
looks	O
with	O
shadow	O
it	O
looks	O
incredible	O
now	O
it	O
looks	O
very	O
cool	O
very	O
very	O
cool	O
oh	O
I	O
love	O
this	O
song	O
is	O
this	O
is	O
super	O
jesse	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
goes	O
perfect	O
with	O
our	O
steampunk	O
aesthetic	O
actually	O
i've	O
been	O
i've	O
been	O
thinking	O
about	O
uh	O
using	O
some	O
some	O
steam	O
punk	O
music	O
for	O
our	O
livestreams	O
but	O
I	O
I	O
do	O
think	O
that	O
could	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
distracting	O
so	O
that's	O
why	O
I	O
haven't	O
put	O
some	O
steam	O
punk	O
music	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
one	O
actually	O
looks	O
feel	O
very	O
nice	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
weird	O
but	O
they	O
they	O
do	O
work	O
I	O
would	O
love	O
to	O
put	O
some	O
pop	O
music	O
because	O
that	O
hides	O
a	O
lot	O
but	O
the	O
thing	O
with	O
pop	O
music	O
is	O
that	O
it's	O
super	O
hum	O
it's	O
super	O
kathy	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
single	O
all	O
day	O
if	O
we	O
did	O
the	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
usage	O
ok	O
I	O
think	O
let	O
me	O
check	O
let	O
us	O
check	O
if	O
there's	O
any	O
yeah	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
elements	O
here	O
below	O
the	O
clocks	O
that	O
haven't	O
been	O
that	O
hard	O
and	O
have	O
a	O
shadow	O
so	O
so	O
so	O
so	O
so	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
replace	O
some	O
shadows	O
in	O
here	O
we're	O
applying	O
some	O
shadows	O
here	O
that's	O
what	O
we	O
are	O
doing	O
right	O
now	O
yeah	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
if	O
you're	O
listening	O
to	O
the	O
music	O
right	O
now	O
but	O
it's	O
super	O
spaces	O
like	O
awesome	O
aw	O
we	O
have	O
two	O
apply	O
also	O
shadow	O
to	O
these	O
gray	O
area	O
awesome	O
marshadow	O
is	O
here	O
yay	O
so	O
much	O
shadow	O
ok	O
let	O
me	O
check	O
in	O
this	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
this	O
area	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
do	O
need	O
to	O
apply	O
more	O
shadow	O
I	O
think	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
paint	O
bucket	O
here	O
yeah	O
but	O
there	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
lower	O
the	O
opacity	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
apply	O
the	O
shadow	O
here	O
great	O
awesome	O
yeah	O
and	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
darken	O
the	O
purple	O
we're	O
using	O
here	O
too	O
so	O
we	O
give	O
a	O
more	O
sense	O
of	O
perspective	O
awesome	O
so	O
now	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
this	O
part	O
is	O
actually	O
behind	O
and	O
not	O
in	O
front	O
so	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
apply	O
more	O
shadowing	O
here	O
great	O
yes	O
this	O
is	O
actually	O
a	O
psychology	O
behind	O
colors	O
usually	O
purple	O
is	O
associated	O
with	O
royalty	O
but	O
well	O
actually	O
that's	O
not	O
very	O
psychological	O
I	O
think	O
but	O
it	O
still	O
applies	O
to	O
something	O
very	O
artificial	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
many	O
medieval	O
times	O
the	O
purple	O
color	O
actually	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
expensive	O
color	O
to	O
make	O
to	O
die	O
usually	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
the	O
most	O
expensive	O
color	O
to	O
apply	O
so	O
it	O
was	O
usually	O
worn	O
by	O
royalty	O
and	O
the	O
catholic	O
church	O
and	O
that's	O
why	O
usually	O
when	O
you	O
see	O
purple	O
you	O
associated	O
with	O
royalty	O
and	O
royal	O
things	O
and	O
flamboyant	O
ann	O

I	O
think	O
yeah	O
I	O
think	O
we've	O
covered	O
no	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
have	O
to	O
apply	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
shadow	O
here	O
in	O
ok	O
some	O
more	O
lighting	O
here	O
we	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
regret	O
it	O
later	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
leave	O
here	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
there	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
sunshine	O
awesome	O
yeah	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
part	O
is	O
really	O
let's	O
go	O
down	O
below	O
yet	O
their	O
blouses	O
perfectly	O
fine	O
their	O
letters	O
are	O
fine	O
we	O
can	O
apply	O
maybe	O
some	O
more	O
shadow	O
here	O
in	O
the	O
golden	O
sleep	O
there	O
we	O
go	O
ok	O
so	O
this	O
part	O
I	O
think	O
is	O
it	O
is	O
looking	O
very	O
fine	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
can	O
leave	O
it	O
there	O
we	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
over	O
shadow	O
because	O
the	O
main	O
aspect	O
of	O
the	O
live	O
stream	O
the	O
idea	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
we	O
focus	O
on	O
the	O
character	O
design	O
itself	O
and	O
not	O
much	O
of	O
in	O
the	O
painting	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
can	O
leave	O
it	O
here	O
yeah	O
so	O
let's	O
go	O
down	O
below	O
ok	O
we	O
can	O
start	O
applying	O
shadow	O
to	O
these	O
kind	O
of	O
dumb	O
kind	O
of	O
belt	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
more	O
an	O
accessory	O
the	O
fans	O
brings	O
on	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
very	O
simple	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
remember	O
where	O
applying	O
our	O
shadows	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
part	O
an	O
we're	O
leaving	O
then	O
light	O
the	O
lights	O
in	O
the	O
left	O
part	O
yes	O
that	O
is	O
correct	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
it's	O
very	O
simple	O
details	O
we	O
are	O
playing	O
here	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
help	O
a	O
lot	O
when	O
we	O
see	O
the	O
bigger	O
picture	O
say	O
we	O
do	O
have	O
to	O
apply	O
some	O
shadows	O
also	O
below	O
the	O
accessory	O
belt	O
here	O
awesome	O
ok	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
apply	O
some	O
light	O
even	O
this	O
part	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
just	O
make	O
simple	O
circle	O
san	O
have	O
some	O
help	O
here	O
with	O
our	O
trusty	O
blender	O
ok	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
I	O
think	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
I	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
so	O
we're	O
gonna	O
fix	O
it	O
ok	O
there	O
an	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
save	O
some	O
of	O
this	O
shadowing	O
he's	O
here	O
now	O
I'm	O
gonna	O
make	O
it	O
more	O
I	O
was	O
using	O
the	O
mixer	O
again	O
that's	O
why	O
I	O
was	O
some	O
painting	O
correctly	O
ok	O
there	O
we	O
go	O
yeah	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
looks	O
fine	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
play	O
some	O
simple	O
shadows	O
below	O
the	O
area	O
below	O
the	O
blouse	O
just	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
more	O
shadowy	O
effects	O
and	O
we	O
can	O
leave	O
it	O
there	O
because	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
keep	O
it	O
simple	O
so	O
yeah	O
actually	O
I	O
think	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
see	O
it	O
from	O
afar	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
much	O
lighting	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
fix	O
that	O
well	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
he	O
was	O
too	O
bright	O
and	O
we're	O
gonna	O
dark	O
native	O
is	O
here	O
cool	O
ok	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
can	O
go	O
on	O
with	O
it	O
uh	O
issues	O

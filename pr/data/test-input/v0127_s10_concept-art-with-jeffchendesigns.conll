oh	O
yeah	O
I	O
think	O
watercolors	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
replicate	O
for	O
digital	O
think	O
traditional	O
paintings	O
ok	O
in	O
fact	O
i'll	O
find	O
out	O
because	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
painting	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
this	O
friday	O
see	O
how	O
that	O
goes	O
I'm	O
very	O
curious	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
like	O
bringing	O
my	O
traditional	O
painting	O
skills	O
into	O
traditional	O
could	O
be	O
very	O
fun	O
oh	O
man	O
why	O
is	O
blue	O
always	O
looks	O
so	O
good	O
off	O
then	O
that's	O
it	O
that's	O
an	O
evil	O
color	O
right	O
there	O
probably	O
good	O
contrast	O
'cause	O
it's	O
like	O
the	O
highlight	O
colors	O
yellow	O
if	O
I	O
contrast	O
that	O
with	O
like	O
a	O
purple	O
that's	O
pretty	O
good	O
open	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
using	O
hey	O
that's	O
a	O
question	O
for	O
future	O
jeff	O
to	O
handle	O
ok	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
it's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
instructed	O
so	O
i'll	O
just	O
use	O
water	O
using	O
will	O
probably	O
most	O
likely	O
be	O
I	O
don't	O
do	O
that	O
oh	O
I	O
meant	O
taking	O
my	O
digital	O
painting	O
skills	O
into	O
traditional	O
see	O
how	O
that	O
goes	O
do	O
I	O
have	O
those	O
colors	O
on	O
anywhere	O
else	O
I	O
don't	O
really	O
have	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
purple	O
e	O
yeah	O
I	O
don't	O
or	O
should	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
same	O
color	O
or	O
should	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
contrast	O
what	O
do	O
you	O
guys	O
think	O
might	O
be	O
too	O
many	O
colours	O
if	O
I	O
make	O
it	O
contrast	O
right	O
like	O
maybe	O
you	O
should	O
stick	O
more	O
too	O
towards	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
already	O
I'm	O
a	O
feeling	O
i'll	O
be	O
using	O
something	O
quick	O
that	O
dries	O
quickly	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
it's	O
like	O
it's	O
not	O
acrylic	O
it's	O
something	O
else	O
is	O
in	O
it	O
the	O
paint	O
but	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
point	O
about	O
single	O
like	O
pink	O
yeah	O
I	O
think	O
if	O
I	O
if	O
I	O
bring	O
into	O
many	O
contrasting	O
ones	O
will	O
be	O
too	O
much	O
especially	O
if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
here	O
I	O
didn't	O
have	O
like	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
like	O
really	O
loud	O
colors	O
on	O
each	O
one	O
at	O
visit	O
many	O
only	O
one	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
i'll	O
just	O
stick	O
to	O
2	O
one	O
here	O
as	O
well	O
which	O
I	O
think	O
is	O
more	O
catching	O
gives	O
more	O
character	O
yeah	O
my	O
concern	O
is	O
it	O
might	O
bring	O
too	O
much	O
for	O
this	O
character	O
compared	O
to	O
the	O
other	O
ones	O
since	O
I	O
am	O
doing	O
them	O
as	O
like	O
a	O
set	O
so	O
if	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
that	O
type	O
of	O
treatment	O
for	O
these	O
guys	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
too	O
much	O
for	O
her	O
I	O
think	O
she	O
probably	O
lined	O
them	O
up	O
as	O
well	O

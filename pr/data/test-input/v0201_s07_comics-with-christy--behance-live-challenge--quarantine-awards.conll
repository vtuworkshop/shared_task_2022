I	O
mean	O
she's	O
already	O
smiling	O
but	O
let's	O
just	O
do	O
that	O
so	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
big	O
let's	O
see	O
about	O
her	O
arms	O
here	O
and	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
put	O
a	O
knit	O
over	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
her	O
because	O
she's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
carrying	O
a	O
red	O
tray	O
and	O
I	O
like	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
like	O
to	O
draw	O
the	O
complete	O
pass	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
be	O
sure	O
this	O
won't	O
be	O
in	O
the	O
final	O
bit	O
but	O
I	O
just	O
wanna	O
make	O
sure	O
everything	O
is	O
there	O
how	O
much	O
time	O
without	O
with	O
super	O
grid	O
how	O
we	O
doing	O
on	O
the	O
on	O
the	O
hydrate	O
I	O
really	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
I	O
like	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
take	O
out	O
I	O
had	O
another	O
one	O
up	O
let	O
me	O
show	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
mean	O
I	O
like	O
the	O
line	O
like	O
that	O
but	O
I	O
just	O
I	O
mean	O
with	O
adding	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
it	O
it	O
was	O
too	O
busy	O
so	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
I	O
needed	O
to	O
simplify	O
things	O
so	O
I	O
took	O
out	O
that	O
an	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
works	O
together	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
especially	O
if	O
I'm	O
printing	O
on	O
a	O
small	O
scale	O
those	O
extra	O
lines	O
in	O
there	O
would	O
have	O
really	O
mucked	O
things	O
up	O
and	O
made	O
it	O
hard	O
to	O
read	O
so	O
I	O
always	O
want	O
to	O
keep	O
legibility	O
in	O
mind	O
when	O
I'm	O
doing	O
those	O
effects	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
type	O
details	O
like	O
that	O
like	O
for	O
example	O
on	O
this	O
one	O
you	O
can't	O
really	O
see	O
it	O
but	O
I	O
I	O
did	O
lining	O
in	O
the	O
drop	O
shadow	O
on	O
the	O
one	O
cup	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
final	O
print	O
this	O
is	O
3	O
inches	O
it	O
didn't	O
really	O
show	O
up	O
it	O
showed	O
up	O
a	O
tiny	O
bit	O
but	O
I	O
mean	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
probably	O
bigger	O
to	O
really	O
really	O
stand	O
out	O
so	O
it's	O
nothing	O
I	O
can	O
keep	O
in	O
mind	O
for	O
the	O
future	O
those	O
tiny	O
details	O
necessarily	O
show	O
up	O
but	O
hold	O
on	O
just	O
a	O
second	O
here	O
i'll	O
be	O
right	O
back	O
all	O
right	O
back	O
so	O
let's	O
go	O
back	O
over	O
here	O
bring	O
this	O
stuff	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
coming	O
out	O
come	O
over	O
here	O
in	O
a	O
racer	O
tail	O
yeah	O
let's	O
think	O
about	O
the	O
um	O
yes	O
I	O
think	O
about	O
the	O
tray	O
with	O
her	O
friend	O
up	O
on	O
it	O
maybe	O
she's	O
using	O
an	O
air	O
bay	O
tree	O
yeah	O
and	O
so	O
that's	O
going	O
to	O
mean	O
this	O
nit	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
dropped	O
out	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
necessarily	O
here	O
understand	O
that's	O
interesting	O
yeah	O
see	O
her	O
bread	O
is	O
gonna	O
be	O
I'm	O
gonna	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
probably	O
grateful	O
bread	O
just	O
so	O
I	O
can	O
run	O
jump	O
in	O
here	O
and	O
see	O
it	O
better	O
put	O
the	O
no	O
whoops	O
didn't	O
mean	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
with	O
my	O
been	O
doing	O
that	O
a	O
lot	O

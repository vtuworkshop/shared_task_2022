she	O

I	O
just	O
ii	O
she	O
wants	O
out	O
so	O
let	O
me	O
out	O
here	O
alright	O
so	O
um	O
yes	O
the	O
original	O
inspiration	O
inspiring	O
katz	O
mobile	O
cheats	O
evil	O
landlord	O
and	O
fat	O
cat	O
they've	O
all	O
since	O
passed	O
away	O
along	O
with	O
cheap	O
most	O
recently	O
in	O
september	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
to	O
this	O
character	O
is	O
based	O
of	O
of	O
she	O
was	O
just	O
the	O
sweetest	O
we	O
quiet	O
gentle	O
cat	O
and	O
the	O
current	O
ones	O
I	O
have	O
are	O
coconut	O
and	O
tuxi	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
coconut	O
is	O
the	O
inspiration	O
for	O
this	O
character	O
right	O
here	O
which	O
this	O
is	O
coconut	O
right	O
here	O
in	O
her	O
colored	O
form	O
and	O
that's	O
normal	O
cheat	O
so	O
much	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
she's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
brown	O
mixed	O
tabby	O
and	O
so	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
designing	O
her	O
character	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
keep	O
the	O
forehead	O
stripes	O
'cause	O
hers	O
were	O
very	O
very	O
very	O
stark	O
and	O
really	O
beautiful	O
she	O
also	O
had	O
these	O
kind	O
of	O
cold	O
out	O
lines	O
around	O
her	O
eyes	O
so	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
keep	O
that	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
went	O
when	O
I	O
blurred	O
my	O
vision	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
her	O
code	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
averaged	O
out	O
to	O
this	O
caramel	O
brown	O
color	O
and	O
then	O
she	O
had	O
her	O
for	O
white	O
sox	O
so	O
that's	O
how	O
I	O
designed	O
that	O
character	O
from	O
life	O
coconut	O
she	O
is	O
dumb	O
not	O
originally	O
she's	O
a	O
calico	O
but	O
apparently	O
calicos	O
only	O
have	O
the	O
black	O
the	O
orange	O
in	O
the	O
white	O
they	O
don't	O
have	O
any	O
other	O
colors	O
mixed	O
in	O
and	O
she	O
does	O
specially	O
like	O
she's	O
just	O
done	O
but	O
she's	O
got	O
everything	O
but	O
if	O
you	O
average	O
it	O
out	O
she's	O
got	O
orange	O
over	O
her	O
head	O
and	O
so	O
I	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
translated	O
that	O
into	O
an	O
orange	O
cap	O
and	O
she	O
also	O
has	O
these	O
patches	O
on	O
her	O
shoulders	O
and	O
that's	O
where	O
her	O
little	O
shoulder	O
patches	O
come	O
from	O
and	O
the	O
striped	O
tail	O
and	O
the	O
patch	O
on	O
her	O
on	O
her	O
toe	O
shoes	O
are	O
also	O
are	O
pretty	O
close	O
to	O
what	O
she	O
has	O
on	O
her	O
actual	O
body	O
tough	O
see	O
is	O
a	O
tuxedo	O
cat	O
but	O
he's	O
great	O
he's	O
not	O
a	O
black	O
tuxedo	O
he's	O
a	O
great	O
acido	O
and	O
he's	O
got	O
the	O
four	O
white	O
paws	O
and	O
he's	O
got	O
a	O
little	O
triangle	O
of	O
white	O
like	O
like	O
white	O
showing	O
through	O
shirt	O
coat	O
jacket	O
and	O
he's	O
a	O
sweet	O
boy	O
and	O
so	O
those	O
are	O
the	O
current	O
cats	O
I	O
have	O
but	O
yeah	O
evil	O
landlord	O
was	O
based	O
off	O
of	O
a	O
cat	O
who	O
was	O
she	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
personality	O
she	O
was	O
very	O
saucy	O
she	O
would	O
lay	O
claim	O
to	O
anything	O
that	O
would	O
come	O
in	O
the	O
door	O
let's	O
be	O
bringing	O
the	O
mail	O
and	O
the	O
lopes	O
boxes	O
she	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
sit	O
on	O
it	O
and	O
we	O
joke	O
that	O
the	O
that	O
she	O
charged	O
the	O
other	O
cats	O
rent	O
so	O
because	O
she	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
queen	O
bee	O
and	O
fat	O
cat	O
was	O
choosing	O
a	O
very	O
shy	O
sweet	O
girl	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
rescue	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
gotten	O
quite	O
a	O
while	O
ago	O
she	O
when	O
I	O
rescued	O
her	O
from	O
the	O
rescue	O
house	O
she	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
getting	O
picked	O
on	O
by	O
other	O
cats	O
so	O
she	O
was	O
always	O
very	O
timid	O
and	O
but	O
kind	O
of	O
oddly	O
loud	O
'cause	O
like	O
wherever	O
she	O
would	O
go	O
should	O
always	O
be	O
talking	O
and	O
chattering	O
at	O
me	O
so	O
she	O
was	O
a	O
sweet	O
girl	O
as	O
well	O

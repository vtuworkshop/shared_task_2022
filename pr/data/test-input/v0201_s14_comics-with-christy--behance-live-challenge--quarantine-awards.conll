that	O
applies	O
though	O
for	O
that	O
too	O
'cause	O
you've	O
got	O
a	O
notice	O
story	O
the	O
background	O
of	O
a	O
character	O
to	O
design	O
them	O
well	O
you	O
know	O
their	O
motivations	O
you	O
know	O
even	O
the	O
clothes	O
that	O
they	O
wear	O
I	O
mean	O
there's	O
a	O
motivation	O
why	O
they	O
picked	O
something	O
over	O
something	O
else	O
as	O
a	O
weapon	O
or	O
as	O
you	O
know	O
as	O
an	O
everyday	O
item	O
that	O
they	O
wear	O
and	O
that's	O
all	O
you	O
know	O
informing	O
the	O
audience	O
when	O
they	O
see	O
your	O
character	O
what	O
the	O
wrist	O
support	O
for	O
oh	O
that's	O
just	O
my	O
wrist	O
yeah	O
this	O
is	O
actually	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
couple	O
of	O
them	O
i've	O
gone	O
through	O
several	O
listens	O
pretty	O
ratty	O
but	O
it	O
so	O
I	O
would	O
say	O
it's	O
a	O
light	O
support	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
compression	O
brace	O
right	O
here	O
it's	O
pretty	O
tight	O
and	O
then	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
different	O
material	O
we've	O
it's	O
more	O
it's	O
more	O
breathable	O
and	O
what	O
I	O
do	O
is	O
I	O
have	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
I	O
have	O
the	O
compression	O
piece	O
going	O
right	O
over	O
the	O
bend	O
in	O
my	O
wrist	O
and	O
that's	O
where	O
I	O
kind	O
of	O
need	O
to	O
support	O
the	O
most	O
this	O
also	O
helps	O
with	O
this	O
right	O
here	O
my	O
hands	O
slide	O
across	O
the	O
tablet	O
surface	O
because	O
these	O
things	O
you	O
know	O
not	O
as	O
much	O
as	O
they	O
used	O
to	O
but	O
they	O
do	O
heat	O
up	O
and	O
your	O
hands	O
get	O
sweaty	O
and	O
so	O
it	O
can	O
stick	O
on	O
the	O
screen	O
well	O
if	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
guard	O
there	O
some	O
guards	O
hook	O
over	O
the	O
pinkie	O
or	O
hook	O
over	O
these	O
two	O
fingers	O
but	O
for	O
me	O
this	O
brace	O
kind	O
of	O
does	O
it	O
well	O
enough	O
for	O
both	O
functions	O
I	O
just	O
I	O
need	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
that	O
stabilization	O
I	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
I	O
also	O
have	O
this	O
wrist	O
brace	O
for	O
when	O
I'm	O
using	O
my	O
mouse	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
bad	O
habit	O
of	O
pressing	O
right	O
down	O
here	O
on	O
the	O
desk	O
when	O
my	O
hand	O
is	O
on	O
the	O
desk	O
so	O
that	O
creates	O
numbness	O
going	O
up	O
my	O
arm	O
so	O
it's	O
just	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
kinda	O
and	O
I	O
do	O
it	O
unintentionally	O
without	O
thinking	O
so	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
put	O
those	O
things	O
in	O
place	O
so	O
I	O
don't	O
really	O
mess	O
up	O
my	O
risk	O
I	O
have	O
um	O
I	O
have	O
more	O
heavy	O
duty	O
ones	O
'cause	O
I	O
have	O
really	O
really	O
messed	O
it	O
up	O
or	O
i've	O
not	O
been	O
able	O
to	O
draw	O
that	O
well	O
uhm	O
i've	O
got	O
one	O
that	O
has	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
a	O
pillow	O
and	O
this	O
one	O
totally	O
immobilize	O
is	O
the	O
wrist	O
it's	O
designed	O
for	O
use	O
at	O
night	O
it's	O
got	O
a	O
pillow	O
here	O
that	O
keeps	O
your	O
wrist	O
in	O
a	O
neutral	O
position	O
an	O
it	O
has	O
it	O
has	O
also	O
kind	O
of	O
extra	O
cushions	O
here	O
to	O
keep	O
your	O
fingers	O
it's	O
all	O
the	O
help	O
keep	O
your	O
wrist	O
and	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
rest	O
does	O
the	O
graphic	O
tablet	O
really	O
help	O
in	O
drawing	O
so	O
they	O
could	O
alternative	O
to	O
mouse	O
and	O
keyboard	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
yes	O
well	O
I	O
mean	O
it	O
really	O
depends	O
on	O
how	O
you	O
work	O
I	O
mean	O
for	O
me	O
yes	O
I	O
mean	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O
keyboard	O
and	O
mouse	O
art	O
for	O
years	O
before	O
I	O
got	O
my	O
first	O
tablet	O
and	O
he	O
difference	O
was	O
phenomenal	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
detail	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
and	O
it	O
also	O
really	O
reinvigorated	O
my	O
interest	O
in	O
digital	O
art	O
because	O
there	O
was	O
such	O
a	O
bar	O
with	O
using	O
the	O
keyboard	O
and	O
mouse	O
with	O
the	O
things	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
how	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
them	O
and	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
qualify	O
that	O
because	O
I	O
mean	O
some	O
people	O
they	O
never	O
they	O
don't	O
need	O
a	O
tablet	O
there's	O
a	O
lettering	O
artist	O
that	O
I	O
follow	O
jessica	O
she	O
she	O
really	O
prefers	O
keyboard	O
and	O
mouse	O
for	O
her	O
digital	O
work	O
and	O
she's	O
doing	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
vector	O
work	O
with	O
letters	O
and	O
designs	O
like	O
that	O
so	O
it	O
really	O
depends	O
on	O
what	O
you're	O
doing	O
and	O
what	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
accomplish	O
if	O
the	O
tablet	O
is	O
a	O
good	O
fit	O
for	O
you	O
but	O
for	O
me	O
personally	O
I	O
really	O
enjoy	O
traditional	O
art	O
and	O
drawing	O
in	O
that	O
way	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
able	O
to	O
bridge	O
the	O
gap	O
I	O
wasn't	O
able	O
to	O
draw	O
down	O
here	O
and	O
look	O
up	O
here	O
it	O
was	O
very	O
very	O
difficult	O
for	O
me	O
but	O
as	O
soon	O
as	O
I	O
combine	O
those	O
two	O
and	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
draw	O
down	O
here	O
and	O
look	O
here	O
that	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
changed	O
the	O
broader	O
closer	O
traditional	O
illustration	O
for	O
me	O

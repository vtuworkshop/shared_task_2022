take	O
us	O
to	O
30	O
frames	O
a	O
second	O
for	O
a	O

I	O
don't	O
I	O

but	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
10	O
seconds	O
10	O
seconds	O
at	O
30	O
so	O
when	O
we	O
are	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
working	O
across	O
different	O
softwares	O
it's	O
really	O
useful	O
to	O
just	O
take	O
a	O
few	O
notes	O
for	O
yourself	O
so	O
we're	O
working	O
in	O
30	O
frames	O
a	O
second	O
1080	O
by	O
1080	O
1010	O
seconds	O
of	O
stuff	O
so	O
we	O
can	O
assume	O
there	O
are	O
300	O
frames	O
so	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
know	O
ok	O
we	O
got	O
300	O
frames	O
going	O
on	O
it's	O
30	O
fps	O
I'm	O
taking	O
physical	O
notes	O
on	O
a	O
physical	O
piece	O
of	O
paper	O
for	O
anyone	O
wondering	O
I	O

is	O
a	O
wonderful	O
wonderful	O
mechanical	O
pencil	O
has	O
this	O
feature	O
where	O
it	O

the	O
lead	O
over	O
the	O
graphite	O
every	O
time	O
you	O
poke	O
it	O
down	O
on	O
the	O
paper	O
cause	O
mutava	O
constantly	O
sharp	O
graphite	O
which	O

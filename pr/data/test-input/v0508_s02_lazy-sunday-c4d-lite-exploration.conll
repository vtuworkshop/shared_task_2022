I	O
think	O
it's	O
interesting	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
as	O
much	O
of	O
a	O
problem	O
differentiating	O
between	O
things	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
I	O
liked	O
the	O
rainbow	O
I	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
cornucopia	O
of	O
things	O
yeah	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
I	O
don't	O
I	O
don't	O
totally	O
understand	O
the	O
logic	O
but	O
personally	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
up	O
to	O
me	O
they	O
would	O
all	O
be	O
unique	O
shapes	O
and	O
unique	O
colors	O
like	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
triangle	O
one	O
of	O
them	O
would	O
be	O
a	O
hexagon	O
but	O
what	O
are	O
you	O
gonna	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
let's	O
clearly	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
meeting	O
and	O
some	O
people	O
did	O
some	O
things	O
that's	O
about	O
all	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
so	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
an	O
archway	O
I	O
wanna	O
make	O
an	O
archway	O
a	O
gateway	O
what	O
is	O
the	O
scene	O
that	O
we	O
are	O
making	O
uh	O
let's	O
see	O
let's	O
see	O
let's	O
think	O
for	O
a	O
minute	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
in	O
rough	O
terms	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
plop	O
a	O
plane	O
where	O
my	O
plane	O
go	O
there	O
it	O
is	O
ok	O
so	O
let's	O
see	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
ground	O
good	O
for	O
us	O
ok	O
how	O
do	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
gateway	O
what	O
I'm	O
thinking	O
about	O
that	O
there's	O
a	O
few	O
ways	O
I	O
might	O
make	O
it	O
few	O
ways	O
I	O
could	O
make	O
a	O
cube	O
why	O
should	O
I	O
mean	O
there's	O
like	O
infinite	O
ways	O
that	O
you	O
could	O
make	O
something	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
make	O
like	O
and	O
at	O
that	O
so	O
we	O
could	O
just	O
assemble	O
it	O
out	O
of	O
some	O
blocks	O
like	O
we	O
could	O
do	O
that	O
like	O
we're	O
playing	O
with	O
lego	O
who	O
who	O
doesn't	O
like	O
playing	O
with	O
lego	O
right	O
uh-huh	O
we	O
could	O
copy	O
and	O
make	O
another	O
one	O
right	O
and	O
then	O
we	O
got	O
this	O
gate	O
open	O
how	O
did	O
I	O
miss	O
that	O
how	O
big	O
are	O
these	O
poop	O
wow	O
big	O
plane	O
ok	O
what	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
just	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
basic	O
stuff	O
of	O
this	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
like	O

would	O
be	O
fun	O
hold	O
on	O
let	O
me	O

down	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
an	O
upgrade	O
for	O
later	O

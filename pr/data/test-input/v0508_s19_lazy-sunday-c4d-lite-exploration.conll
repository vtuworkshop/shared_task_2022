and	O
then	O
we	O
could	O
take	O
the	O
wall	O
and	O
we	O
could	O
just	O
make	O
editable	O
then	O
I	O
could	O
grab	O
the	O
points	O
all	O
right	O
right	O
what	O
sale	O
well	O
kelly	O
that	O
maybe	O
is	O
this	O
anything	O
where	O
did	O
that	O
wall	O
go	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
down	O
here	O
and	O
appan	O
this	O
wall	O
or	O
we	O
could	O
even	O
was	O
great	O
is	O
now	O
I	O
could	O
put	O
a	O
little	O
hole	O
in	O
the	O
bottom	O
of	O
the	O
wall	O
block	O
so	O
subdivision	O
surface	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
we've	O
talked	O
about	O
this	O
the	O
subdivision	O
surface	O
helps	O
me	O
smooth	O
smooth	O
things	O
out	O
by	O
adding	O
more	O
subdivisions	O
so	O
for	O
example	O
the	O
wall	O
is	O
made	O
of	O
these	O
things	O
this	O
is	O
actually	O
kind	O
of	O
the	O
wavy	O
wall	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
achieve	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
ago	O
so	O
maybe	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
you	O
don't	O
know	O
but	O
it	O
does	O
allow	O
you	O
to	O
have	O
like	O
a	O
wave	O
which	O
is	O
cool	O
all	O
well	O
because	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
fantasy	O
thing	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
hum	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
like	O
a	O
like	O
a	O
like	O
an	O
undulating	O
waves	O
constantly	O
who	O
who	O
who	O
ok	O
let	O
me	O
maybe	O
we	O
do	O
some	O
experiments	O
with	O
this	O
other	O
wall	O
hold	O
on	O
ok	O
1010	O
car	O
thinking	O
about	O
oh	O
that's	O
that	O
ok	O
so	O
sorry	O
I	O
just	O
put	O
something	O
called	O
the	O
formula	O
to	O
former	O
up	O
on	O
this	O
wall	O
which	O
is	O
great	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
as	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
it	O
is	O
now	O
putting	O
sine	O
wave	O
through	O
the	O
thing	O
which	O
was	O
fun	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
that's	O
really	O
what	O
I	O
wanted	O
it	O
was	O
cool	O
though	O
I	O
did	O
I	O
did	O
find	O
it	O
very	O
cool	O
the	O
I	O
do	O
like	O
symmetry	O
in	O
this	O
I	O
like	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
symmetrical	O
thing	O
so	O
maybe	O
we	O
stick	O
with	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
to	O
keep	O
having	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
there	O
really	O
no	O
mirror	O
in	O
here	O
is	O
this	O
for	O
real	O
this	O
is	O
where	O
I'm	O
at	O
this	O
is	O
what's	O
happening	O
to	O
my	O
life	O
ok	O
anyway	O
now	O
they'll	O
both	O
be	O
mirrored	O
building	O
high	O
ah	O
yeah	O
do	O
do	O
do	O
ok	O
1st	O
hey	O
who	O
wants	O
to	O
have	O
some	O
fun	O

15	O
minutes	O
here	O
let's	O
let's	O
take	O

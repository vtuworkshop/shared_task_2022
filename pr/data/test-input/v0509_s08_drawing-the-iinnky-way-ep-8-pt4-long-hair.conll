so	O
you	O
try	O
to	O
draw	O
something	O
that's	O
super	O
epic	O
so	O
you	O
can	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
can	O
you	O
can	O
make	O
everybody	O
in	O
the	O
room	O
make	O
their	O
jaw	O
hit	O
the	O
floor	O
and	O
what	O
you	O
realize	O
is	O
crap	O
every	O
single	O
time	O
around	O
somebody	O
I	O
can't	O
seem	O
to	O
draw	O
an	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
why	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
I	O
make	O
myself	O
look	O
real	O
bad	O
because	O
everybody	O
else	O
is	O
killing	O
it	O
and	O
I'm	O
sitting	O
there	O
doing	O
nothing	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
that	O
comes	O
from	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O
you	O
first	O
off	O
you	O
do	O
your	O
best	O
creativity	O
when	O
you're	O
on	O
your	O
own	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
draw	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
somebody	O
else	O
does	O
not	O
make	O
you	O
a	O
better	O
artist	O
actually	O
nothing	O
in	O
general	O
makes	O
you	O
a	O
better	O
artist	O
other	O
than	O
you	O
feeling	O
like	O
you	O
are	O
better	O
than	O
you	O
were	O
the	O
day	O
before	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
someone	O
else	O
feels	O
about	O
your	O
art	O
isn't	O
going	O
to	O
change	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
you	O
feel	O
you	O
know	O
'cause	O
ultimately	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
happy	O
in	O
that	O
moment	O
but	O
then	O
once	O
those	O
people	O
are	O
gone	O
that	O
feeling	O
goes	O
with	O
them	O
so	O
someone	O
tells	O
you	O
that	O
you're	O
super	O
good	O
and	O
you	O
should	O
chase	O
this	O
dream	O
and	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
of	O
that	O
if	O
that	O
person	O
isn't	O
there	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
every	O
single	O
day	O
you	O
start	O
drifting	O
slowly	O
and	O
slowly	O
back	O
to	O
that	O
point	O
where	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
why	O
am	O
I	O
doing	O
this	O
you	O
will	O
have	O
this	O
all	O
the	O
time	O
in	O
art	O
forever	O
where	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
you're	O
a	O
fraud	O
no	O
matter	O
how	O
good	O
you	O
get	O
no	O
matter	O
how	O
far	O
you	O
go	O
if	O
you	O
can't	O
reach	O
the	O
level	O
of	O
the	O
artist	O
that	O
you	O
you	O
have	O
watched	O
and	O
you	O
worship	O
or	O
whatever	O
you	O
will	O
always	O
feel	O
inadequate	O
in	O
you	O
always	O
feel	O
like	O
what	O
you're	O
doing	O
isn't	O
worth	O
doing	O
and	O
you've	O
wasted	O
all	O
at	O
a	O
time	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
what	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
basically	O
do	O
is	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
try	O
to	O
limit	O
that	O
you	O
never	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
stop	O
it	O
you	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
limit	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
limit	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
practicing	O
helps	O
a	O
lot	O
because	O
practicing	O
takes	O
away	O
that	O
a	O
dead	O
desire	O
to	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
good	O
because	O
you're	O
that's	O
why	O
you're	O
practicing	O
you	O
know	O
if	O
you	O
suck	O
while	O
you're	O
practicing	O
it's	O
like	O
well	O
that's	O
why	O
I'm	O
practicing	O
it	O
you	O
not	O
trying	O
to	O
create	O
a	O
piece	O
of	O
art	O
and	O
the	O
artist	O
failing	O
and	O
you're	O
giving	O
up	O
because	O
you	O
can't	O
do	O
it	O
practice	O
is	O
literally	O
the	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
uh	O
is	O
the	O
I	O
can't	O
think	O
of	O
the	O
damn	O
word	O
it's	O
the	O
art	O
of	O
failing	O
and	O
fixing	O
your	O
failures	O
or	O
trying	O
to	O
make	O
your	O
failures	O
less	O
well	O
you	O
know	O
failed	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you're	O
when	O
you're	O
sitting	O
here	O
practicing	O
like	O
I'm	O
practicing	O
her	O
right	O
now	O
I	O
know	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
her	O
but	O
me	O
practicing	O
her	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
it	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
efficient	O
and	O
it's	O
also	O
going	O
to	O
help	O
other	O
people	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
there's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
times	O
where	O
I	O
will	O
draw	O
her	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
draw	O
an	O
I	O
just	O
don't	O
like	O
the	O
way	O
it	O
comes	O
out	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
what	O
the	O
heck	O
I	O
did	O
wrong	O
and	O
I'm	O
sitting	O
there	O
fighting	O
with	O
myself	O
about	O
why	O
the	O
hair	O
looks	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
it	O
doesn't	O
you	O
know	O
or	O
why	O
I	O
can't	O
get	O
this	O
to	O
look	O
a	O
specific	O
way	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
different	O
things	O
like	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
different	O
hairstyles	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
actually	O
you	O
can	O
actually	O
learn	O
or	O
that	O
I	O
actually	O
learned	O
from	O
being	O
an	O
artist	O
is	O
that	O
if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
an	O
artist	O
work	O
next	O
to	O
each	O
other	O
like	O
this	O
you	O
could	O
almost	O
see	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
they	O
struggled	O
with	O
versus	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
were	O
easy	O
the	O
ones	O
that	O
were	O
easy	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
lot	O
lighter	O
and	O
less	O
busy	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
like	O
sketch	O
lines	O
the	O
more	O
the	O
more	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
sketch	O
the	O
more	O
I	O
wasn't	O
confident	O
in	O
what	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O
I	O
was	O
sculpting	O
when	O
you	O
know	O
you're	O
sculpting	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
cleaner	O
you	O
know	O
is	O
that	O
way	O
when	O
you	O
draw	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
normally	O
draw	O
a	O
lot	O
and	O
it's	O
that	O
way	O
when	O
you	O
when	O
you	O
when	O
you're	O
confident	O
in	O
your	O
steps	O
at	O
least	O
that	O
way	O
for	O
me	O
the	O
more	O
confident	O
that	O
I	O
am	O
the	O
less	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
what	O
I'm	O
doing	O
you	O
know	O
which	O
is	O
definitely	O
a	O
huge	O
huge	O
thing	O
only	O
on	O
55	O
so	O
I	O
make	O
my	O
my	O
canvases	O
multiples	O
of	O
5th	O
of	O
multiples	O
of	O
11	O
1/2	O
by	O
17	O
so	O
I	O
make	O
the	O
sheets	O
of	O
paper	O
or	O
I	O
make	O
the	O
sheets	O
you	O
no	O
longer	O
by	O
multiples	O
of	O
like	O
11	O
so	O
that	O
if	O
people	O
wanted	O
to	O
cut	O
this	O
up	O
in	O
like	O
add	O
to	O
it	O
or	O
print	O
it	O
out	O
or	O
whatever	O
crap	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
went	O
through	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
why	O
didn't	O
I	O
get	O
any	O
bigger	O
'cause	O
I	O
made	O
it	O
go	O
to	O
row	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
clicked	O
it	O
and	O
I	O
didn't	O
so	O
usually	O
when	O
I	O
do	O
my	O
canvases	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
I	O
always	O
make	O
them	O
go	O
like	O
multiples	O
of	O
11	O
so	O
that	O
when	O
people	O
if	O
people	O
want	O
to	O
print	O
this	O
out	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
out	O
of	O
printed	O
out	O
on	O
11	O
1/2	O
by	O
17	O
paper	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
have	O
relatively	O
large	O
relatively	O
large	O
print	O
out	O
that	O
they	O
can	O
work	O
with	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O

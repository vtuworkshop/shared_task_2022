I	O
was	O
doing	O
what	O
most	O
artists	O
do	O
when	O
we	O
first	O
start	O
out	O
you	O
just	O
jump	O
in	O
and	O
you	O
draw	O
like	O
a	O
printer	O
where	O
you	O
draw	O
from	O
the	O
top	O
to	O
bottom	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
drawing	O
and	O
I	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
I	O
had	O
I	O
had	O
drawn	O
this	O
I	O
right	O
here	O
you	O
know	O
'cause	O
I	O
mean	O
it	O
was	O
pretty	O
much	O
the	O
same	O
eye	O
that	O
had	O
already	O
had	O
already	O
drawn	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
this	O
I	O
over	O
here	O
which	O
it	O
is	O
very	O
hard	O
for	O
people	O
to	O
do	O
when	O
your	O
when	O
you're	O
learning	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
drawing	O
drawing	O
the	O
three	O
quarter	O
I	O
on	O
the	O
far	O
side	O
is	O
more	O
difficult	O
than	O
you	O
could	O
possibly	O
imagine	O
when	O
you	O
don't	O
necessarily	O
understand	O
three	O
quarter	O
shapes	O
you	O
know	O
or	O
three	O
quarter	O
vision	O
or	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
call	O
it	O
like	O
when	O
you	O
can't	O
understand	O
how	O
drawing	O
something	O
in	O
three	O
quarter	O
view	O
works	O
it	O
could	O
it	O
could	O
drive	O
you	O
nuts	O
which	O
it	O
was	O
driving	O
me	O
crazy	O
'cause	O
I'm	O
like	O
I	O
can't	O
I	O
can't	O
I	O
don't	O
get	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
swear	O
to	O
you	O
at	O
this	O
moment	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
why	O
won't	O
let	O
me	O
let	O
me	O
let	O
me	O
let	O
me	O
switch	O
layers	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
what	O
no	O
switch	O
area	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
why	O
why	O
can't	O
I	O
do	O
this	O
eyeball	O
it's	O
so	O
simple	O
like	O
I	O
don't	O
understand	O
it	O
why	O
can't	O
I	O
just	O
draw	O
an	O
almond	O
shape	O
and	O
then	O
put	O
a	O
circle	O
in	O
it	O
and	O
I	O
I	O
stopped	O
right	O
there	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
like	O
oh	O
my	O
god	O
oh	O
my	O
god	O
'cause	O
at	O
that	O
moment	O
something	O
that	O
i've	O
been	O
told	O
my	O
entire	O
life	O
made	O
since	O
my	O
friends	O
my	O
teachers	O
everybody	O
would	O
always	O
tell	O
me	O
that	O
art	O
is	O
simple	O
it's	O
all	O
made	O
up	O
of	O
basic	O
shapes	O
the	O
better	O
you	O
understand	O
those	O
shapes	O
the	O
better	O
you	O
will	O
be	O
at	O
drawing	O
and	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
always	O
be	O
like	O
that	O
is	O
just	O
the	O
stupidest	O
thing	O
i've	O
ever	O
heard	O
my	O
life	O
that	O
is	O
just	O
the	O
dumbest	O
thing	O
i've	O
ever	O
heard	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
like	O
it	O
did	O
this	O
just	O
lines	O
there's	O
no	O
way	O
that	O
these	O
things	O
are	O
made	O
up	O
of	O
shapes	O
like	O
you	O
expect	O
me	O
to	O
draw	O
circles	O
and	O
squares	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
place	O
until	O
it	O
becomes	O
really	O
good	O
I	O
don't	O
believe	O
that	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
it	O
differently	O
and	O
for	O
the	O
life	O
of	O
me	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
wrapped	O
my	O
head	O
around	O
that	O
until	O
that	O
very	O
moment	O
and	O
at	O
that	O
moment	O
I	O
was	O
like	O
oh	O
my	O
god	O
so	O
you're	O
meaning	O
to	O
tell	O
him	O
you	O
mean	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
problems	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
through	O
we're	O
literally	O
because	O
I	O
didn't	O
pre	O
sketch	O
my	O
work	O
and	O
I	O
didn't	O
use	O
basic	O
shapes	O
so	O
I	O
drew	O
the	O
I	O
like	O
several	O
times	O
I	O
remember	O
'cause	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
this	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
this	O
I	O
just	O
kept	O
doing	O
this	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
was	O
drawn	O
the	O
other	O
side	O
once	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
was	O
just	O
I	O
just	O
kept	O
doing	O
this	O
over	O
and	O
over	O
and	O
I'm	O
like	O
are	O
you	O
kidding	O
me	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
started	O
drawing	O
eyes	O
straightforward	O
where	O
I	O
would	O
just	O
draw	O
allman	O
shapes	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
I'm	O
like	O
you	O
know	O
putting	O
the	O
putting	O
the	O
eyeball	O
in	O
I'm	O
like	O
I'm	O
hitting	O

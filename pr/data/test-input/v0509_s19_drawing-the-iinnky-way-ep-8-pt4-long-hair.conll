you're	O
telling	O
me	O
that	O
all	O
this	O
time	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
basically	O
telling	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
was	O
two	O
pre	O
sketch	O
your	O
drawings	O
as	O
basic	O
shapes	O
and	O
add	O
detail	O
and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
stuff	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
told	O
automatically	O
made	O
sense	O
because	O
I	O
said	O
ok	O
now	O
I	O
know	O
why	O
I	O
don't	O
understand	O
what	O
they	O
were	O
saying	O
it	O
wasn't	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
explaining	O
it	O
wrong	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
my	O
feeble	O
brain	O
could	O
not	O
interpret	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
they	O
were	O
explaining	O
it	O
I	O
was	O
listening	O
to	O
it	O
as	O
something	O
else	O
and	O
I	O
couldn't	O
interpret	O
what	O
they	O
meant	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
kind	O
of	O
where	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
when	O
it	O
came	O
to	O
drawing	O
anything	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
like	O
I	O
in	O
my	O
brain	O
I'm	O
like	O
I	O
don't	O
get	O
with	O
it	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
what	O
they're	O
talking	O
about	O
they	O
keep	O
talking	O
about	O
basic	O
shapes	O
and	O
this	O
and	O
that	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
artists	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
didn't	O
understand	O
and	O
it's	O
something	O
that	O
always	O
stuck	O
with	O
me	O
in	O
my	O
whole	O
entire	O
life	O
was	O
like	O
whenever	O
I	O
hear	O
somebody	O
explain	O
something	O
to	O
someone	O
I'm	O
thinking	O
like	O
this	O
person	O
is	O
probably	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
because	O
their	O
brain	O
doesn't	O
understand	O
what	O
this	O
person	O
is	O
talking	O
about	O
they	O
haven't	O
they	O
haven't	O
gotten	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
they	O
understand	O
what	O
these	O
terms	O
mean	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
if	O
someone	O
says	O
everything	O
is	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
basic	O
shapes	O
our	O
brain	O
infinite	O
are	O
automatically	O
goes	O
to	O
circle	O
square	O
rectangle	O
triangle	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
literally	O
what	O
it	O
goes	O
to	O
every	O
single	O
time	O
circle	O
square	O
rectangle	O
triangle	O
that	O
no	O
one	O
is	O
telling	O
you	O
that	O
the	O
basic	O
shapes	O
aren't	O
actually	O
the	O
basic	O
shapes	O
it	O
is	O
just	O
the	O
most	O
basic	O
shape	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
to	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
remember	O
what	O
you're	O
drawing	O
so	O
now	O
let	O
me	O
let	O
me	O
let	O
me	O
let	O
me	O
go	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
further	O
in	O
depth	O
with	O
that	O
because	O
this	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
always	O
this	O
is	O
this	O
is	O
generally	O
where	O
I'm	O
usually	O
at	O
when	O
I	O
would	O
always	O
get	O
frustrated	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
I'm	O
like	O
everything	O
is	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
basic	O
saves	O
right	O
and	O
of	O
course	O
everybody's	O
like	O
yeah	O
when	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
whatever	O
like	O
take	O
something	O
like	O
let's	O
see	O
actually	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
octopus	O
will	O
serve	O
pretty	O
well	O
for	O
this	O
is	O
andrew	O
will	O
take	O
out	O
will	O
take	O
my	O
octopus	O
test	O
sheet	O
and	O
i'll	O
tell	O
you	O
everything	O
is	O
made	O
up	O
of	O
basic	O
shapes	O
the	O
red	O
in	O
all	O
of	O
my	O
all	O
of	O
my	O
tests	O
that	O
you	O
see	O
because	O
I	O
do	O
these	O
things	O
every	O
day	O
the	O
red	O
that	O
you	O
see	O
in	O
my	O
testes	O
are	O
the	O
most	O
basic	O
shapes	O
that	O
I	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
to	O
identify	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
this	O
specific	O
theme	O
let	O
me	O
find	O
that	O
actually	O
let	O
me	O
get	O
the	O
actual	O
png	O
out	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
erase	O
everything	O
else	O
but	O
no	O
one	O
explained	O
that	O
to	O
me	O
everybody	O
was	O
just	O
basically	O
telling	O
me	O
everything	O
was	O
made	O
of	O
a	O
basic	O
save	O
so	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
first	O
start	O
drawing	O
and	O
you're	O
doing	O
your	O
anatomy	O
studies	O
you	O
get	O
that	O
loomis	O
book	O
or	O
whatever	O
and	O
it's	O
breaking	O
things	O
down	O
into	O
rectangles	O
and	O
boxes	O
and	O
all	O
of	O
that	O
stuff	O
is	O
what	O
confuses	O
the	O
average	O
person	O
because	O
you're	O
thinking	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
draw	O
boxes	O
and	O
circles	O
and	O
squares	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
stuff	O
for	O
everything	O
that	O
you're	O
doing	O
where	O
in	O
all	O
actuality	O
this	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
known	O
shape	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
shapes	O
to	O
make	O
something	O
that's	O
familiar	O
what	O
they're	O
literally	O
telling	O
you	O
is	O
you're	O
trying	O
to	O
create	O
the	O
most	O
basic	O
form	O
that	O
will	O
help	O
you	O
remember	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
what	O
everything	O
you're	O
drawing	O
the	O
more	O
simple	O
it	O
has	O
to	O
be	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
remember	O
the	O
more	O
simple	O
you	O
make	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
this	O
right	O
here	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
shape	O
you	O
couldn't	O
give	O
this	O
you	O
can	O
name	O
it	O
whatever	O
you	O
want	O
but	O
it	O
doesn't	O
have	O
an	O
actual	O
name	O
in	O
the	O
spectral	O
shapes	O
it's	O
just	O
a	O
combination	O
of	O
shapes	O
put	O
together	O
to	O
make	O
something	O
but	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
basic	O
shape	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
to	O
describe	O
how	O
I	O
drew	O
this	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
whole	O
purpose	O
of	O
fundamentals	O
which	O
is	O
something	O
that	O
would	O
have	O
saved	O
me	O
20	O
something	O
years	O
of	O
study	O
is	O
to	O
teach	O
your	O
hands	O
to	O
work	O
with	O
your	O
brain	O
you're	O
teaching	O
your	O
hands	O
to	O
understand	O
what	O
your	O
brain	O
is	O
telling	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
if	O
they're	O
telling	O
you	O
to	O
draw	O
tentacle	O
and	O
you	O
don't	O
know	O
where	O
to	O
start	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
your	O
brain	O
goes	O
too	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
build	O
detail	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
it	O
same	O
with	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
things	O
you	O
know	O
same	O
with	O
this	O
this	O
is	O
like	O
it	O
makes	O
no	O
sense	O
to	O
anybody	O
else	O
but	O
your	O
brain	O
because	O
these	O
are	O
your	O
shapes	O
you	O
know	O
these	O
are	O
the	O
things	O
that	O
you	O
go	O
to	O
to	O
help	O
you	O
start	O
drawing	O
this	O
particular	O
creature	O
at	O
this	O
particular	O
pose	O
you	O
all	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
once	O
you	O
once	O
you	O
get	O
good	O
enough	O
you	O
can	O
take	O
the	O
simplest	O
of	O
shapes	O
you	O
know	O
that	O
will	O
help	O
you	O
draw	O
this	O
character	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
move	O
it	O
in	O

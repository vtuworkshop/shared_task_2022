in	O
3d	O
so	O
now	O
you	O
don't	O
necessarily	O
have	O
to	O
draw	O
8	O
million	O
different	O
poses	O
you	O
now	O
can	O
you	O
now	O
have	O
the	O
basic	O
shape	O
of	O
the	O
back	O
of	O
this	O
thing's	O
head	O
the	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
things	O
had	O
the	O
eyeballs	O
and	O
now	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
move	O
it	O
to	O
whatever	O
position	O
you	O
want	O
so	O
now	O
you	O
can	O
just	O
turn	O
it	O
any	O
any	O
way	O
you	O
want	O
from	O
any	O
position	O
that	O
you	O
want	O
and	O
add	O
alittle	O
same	O
elements	O
to	O
it	O
and	O
make	O
this	O
character	O
and	O
draw	O
it	O
all	O
out	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
now	O
do	O
that	O
on	O
your	O
own	O
without	O
having	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
reference	O
or	O
anything	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
it	O
makes	O
it	O
10	O
times	O
easier	O
to	O
you	O
know	O
do	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
with	O
like	O
drawing	O
heads	O
and	O
stuff	O
you	O
know	O
moving	O
his	O
head	O
and	O
all	O
these	O
different	O
positions	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
it's	O
still	O
just	O
ahead	O
the	O
basic	O
shape	O
of	O
my	O
head	O
is	O
an	O
upside	O
down	O
egg	O
shape	O
that's	O
the	O
most	O
basic	O
shape	O
of	O
my	O
head	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
draw	O
heads	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
basic	O
shape	O
that	O
I	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
is	O
that	O
shape	O
right	O
there	O
that's	O
it	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
basic	O
shape	O
that	O
I	O
come	O
up	O
with	O
so	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
to	O
explain	O
to	O
somebody	O
else	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
heads	O
that	O
was	O
be	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
the	O
most	O
simple	O
explanation	O
and	O
then	O
of	O
course	O
they	O
probably	O
wouldn't	O
get	O
it	O
be	O
like	O
in	O
upside	O
down	O
and	O
shape	O
they	O
would	O
keep	O
drawing	O
an	O
egg	O
and	O
every	O
position	O
but	O
almost	O
like	O
when	O
they	O
would	O
draw	O
the	O
egg	O
shaped	O
would	O
always	O
look	O
the	O
same	O
so	O
now	O
you	O
need	O
now	O
you	O
need	O
a	O
reference	O
guide	O
so	O
you	O
I	O
have	O
this	O
thing	O
right	O
here	O
where	O
is	O
literally	O
just	O
a	O
bunch	O
of	O
positions	O
you	O
put	O
your	O
head	O
in	O
using	O
the	O
same	O
basic	O
shape	O
just	O
turned	O
in	O
a	O
different	O
direction	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
then	O
and	O
then	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
sense	O
to	O
people	O
that	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
is	O
based	O
on	O
one	O
simple	O
shape	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
an	O
egg	O
all	O
I'm	O
basically	O
doing	O
is	O
taking	O
this	O
egg	O
and	O
then	O
adding	O
lines	O
to	O
guide	O
which	O
wherever	O
I	O
want	O
the	O
head	O
to	O
be	O
at	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
no	O
matter	O
where	O
you	O
no	O
matter	O
where	O
I	O
position	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
in	O
upside	O
down	O
egg	O
you	O
just	O
move	O
the	O
upside	O
down	O
egg	O
to	O
the	O
position	O
you	O
want	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
use	O
these	O
past	O
lines	O
which	O
I	O
didn't	O
necessarily	O
know	O
what	O
they	O
did	O
with	O
these	O
lines	O
I	O
just	O
know	O
that	O
they	O
had	O
him	O
but	O
the	O
lines	O
are	O
to	O
orientate	O
your	O
brain	O
so	O
that	O
you	O
don't	O
forget	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
where	O
this	O
person	O
is	O
looking	O
you	O
know	O
all	O
of	O
this	O
stuff	O
is	O
to	O
do	O
one	O
thing	O
is	O
the	O
speed	O
you	O
up	O
to	O
make	O
you	O
more	O
efficient	O
why	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
more	O
efficient	O
because	O
your	O
brain	O
is	O
ever	O
changing	O
you	O
ever	O
have	O
an	O
idea	O
when	O
you're	O
out	O
but	O
when	O
you	O
get	O
home	O
you	O
forget	O
it	O
you	O
ever	O
you	O
ever	O
have	O
a	O
really	O
cool	O
concept	O
star	O
drawing	O
and	O
by	O
the	O
time	O
you	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
something	O
different	O
or	O
you	O
forget	O
what	O
you're	O
doing	O
and	O
you	O
change	O
it	O
or	O
whatever	O
is	O
because	O
your	O
brain	O
your	O
brain	O
is	O
forever	O
constantly	O
changing	O
its	O
spot	O
in	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
is	O
'cause	O
it's	O
so	O
much	O
stuff	O
going	O
in	O
and	O
out	O
of	O
it	O
and	O
so	O
much	O
stuff	O
is	O
storing	O
or	O
whatever	O
that	O
your	O
brain	O
will	O
shift	O
what's	O
your	O
original	O
concept	O
isn't	O
it	O
will	O
morph	O
into	O
something	O
else	O
that	O
the	O
idea	O
of	O
speed	O
drawing	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
is	O
to	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
have	O
in	O
your	O
brain	O
on	O
paper	O
as	O
fast	O
as	O
possible	O
so	O
your	O
brain	O
can	O
focus	O
and	O
that's	O
generally	O
what	O
people	O
mean	O
when	O
they	O
say	O
focus	O
is	O
to	O
keep	O
your	O
brain	O
from	O
wandering	O
to	O
something	O
else	O
it	O
will	O
do	O
it	O
automatically	O
where	O
you	O
will	O
sit	O
here	O
and	O
you	O
will	O
draw	O
face	O
for	O
so	O
long	O
and	O
then	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
draw	O
horns	O
on	O
this	O
face	O
when	O
you	O
didn't	O
want	O
to	O
before	O
you	O
just	O
think	O
that	O
well	O
in	O
this	O
particular	O
position	O
these	O
horns	O
look	O
great	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
put	O
horns	O
on	O
this	O
and	O
it's	O
like	O
why	O
don't	O
why	O
do	O
why	O
do	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
put	O
horns	O
on	O
this	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
horns	O
aren't	O
going	O
to	O
work	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
it	O
will	O
work	O
because	O
your	O
brain	O
is	O
telling	O
you	O
it's	O
kind	O
of	O
like	O
cooler	O
so	O
you	O
add	O
horns	O
and	O
it's	O
like	O
well	O
my	O
original	O
concept	O
didn't	O
call	O
for	O
horns	O
but	O
we're	O
putting	O
horns	O
and	O
then	O
all	O
of	O
a	O
sudden	O
it's	O
like	O
well	O
this	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
girl	O
but	O
now	O
it's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
sentar	O
because	O
for	O
some	O
reason	O
this	O
would	O
look	O
cooler	O
if	O
I	O
drew	O
it	O
as	O
a	O
horse	O
but	O
then	O
that's	O
the	O
problem	O
because	O
now	O
you	O
start	O
dreaming	O
bigger	O
and	O
you	O
can't	O
draw	O
that	O
fast	O
and	O
you	O
start	O
you	O
start	O
drawing	O
things	O
wrong	O
and	O
you	O
started	O
not	O
liking	O
stuff	O
and	O
now	O
the	O
whole	O
interpret	O
the	O
whole	O
original	O
concept	O
that	O
you	O
were	O
drawing	O
which	O
is	O
literally	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
just	O
a	O
girl	O
standing	O
there	O
holding	O
an	O
ice	O
cream	O
is	O
now	O
a	O
sentar	O
running	O
through	O
a	O
forest	O
you	O
know	O
doing	O
whatever	O
because	O
you	O
took	O
too	O
long	O
to	O
draw	O
now	O
you	O
get	O
your	O
concept	O
down	O
on	O
paper	O
really	O
quick	O
your	O
brain	O
can't	O
can't	O
change	O
stuff	O
your	O
brain	O
will	O
literally	O
just	O
be	O
stuck	O
on	O
the	O
original	O
concept	O

you	O
may	O
make	O
improvements	O
on	O
the	O
anatomy	O
in	O
which	O
you're	O
drawing	O
or	O
whatever	O
and	O
or	O
the	O
scenes	O
or	O
whatever	O
but	O
your	O
brain	O
will	O
stay	O
stuck	O
on	O
that	O
original	O
concept	O
because	O
now	O
it	O
has	O
something	O
to	O
grab	O
onto	O
also	O
it	O
helps	O
to	O
draw	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
say	O
you	O
walk	O
away	O
and	O
you	O
come	O
back	O
it	O
helps	O
to	O
bring	O
that	O
memory	O
of	O
what	O
you	O
thought	O
about	O
back	O
because	O
now	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
quick	O
sketch	O
and	O
say	O
you	O
say	O
you	O
start	O
drawing	O
it	O
I	O
write	O
you	O
drawing	O
a	O
really	O
detailed	O
I	O
and	O
this	O
I	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
part	O
of	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
the	O
mona	O
lisa	O
but	O
you	O
walk	O
away	O
and	O
you	O
eat	O
dinner	O
and	O
you	O
go	O
watch	O
the	O
tv	O
show	O
and	O
you	O
come	O
back	O
and	O
it's	O
just	O
an	O
eye	O
there	O
gonna	O
be	O
like	O
what	O
was	O
i4	O
I	O
I	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
be	O
for	O
some	O
woman	O
or	O
something	O
but	O
I	O
don't	O
remember	O
what	O
the	O
I	O
was	O
for	O
I	O
just	O
I	O
what	O
was	O
I	O
doing	O
well	O
this	O
really	O
looks	O
cool	O
so	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
take	O
this	O
I	O
and	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
drew	O
it	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
what	O
is	O
for	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
cyclops	O
'cause	O
I	O
mean	O
it's	O
and	O
I	O
obviously	O
I	O
was	O
drawing	O
a	O
slide	O
clouds	O
right	O
why	O
it	O
why	O
else	O
would	O
I	O
just	O
have	O
a	O
random	O
one	O
I	O
you	O
know	O
that's	O
what	O
your	O
brain	O
does	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
ever	O
think	O
back	O
you	O
ever	O
look	O
at	O
old	O
artwork	O
and	O
you	O
think	O
why	O
the	O
hell	O
did	O
I	O
draw	O
this	O
what	O
was	O
I	O
thinking	O
about	O
this	O
is	O
so	O
stupid	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
wasn't	O
stupid	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
was	O
awesome	O
you	O
know	O
'cause	O
your	O
brain	O
wanted	O
to	O
draw	O
that	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
you	O
know	O
and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
just	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
what	O
I	O
draw	O
when	O
I'm	O
younger	O
or	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
younger	O
was	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
saw	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
was	O
cool	O
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
draw	O
I	O
kept	O
I	O
kept	O
trying	O
to	O
redraw	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
couldn't	O
draw	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
younger	O
after	O
I	O
had	O
my	O
breakthrough	O
you	O
know	O
every	O
artist	O
will	O
have	O
their	O
breakthrough	O
doesn't	O
matter	O
what	O
you	O
do	O
in	O
that	O
breakthrough	O
happens	O
I	O
always	O
try	O
to	O
explain	O
to	O
people	O
that	O
have	O
breakthrough	O
isn't	O
learning	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
hands	O
'cause	O
they're	O
like	O
oh	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
break	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
learned	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
hands	O
and	O
I'm	O
like	O
that's	O
not	O
a	O
breakthrough	O
when	O
you	O
have	O
a	O
breakthrough	O
it's	O
not	O
learning	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
hands	O
is	O
learning	O
the	O
meaning	O
of	O
drawing	O
or	O
how	O
to	O
draw	O
you	O
know	O
it's	O
not	O
just	O
drawing	O
hands	O
it's	O
me	O
it	O
means	O
you	O
can	O
draw	O
anything	O
now	O
because	O
you	O
understand	O
the	O
basic	O
concept	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
construct	O
anything	O
the	O
basic	O
concepts	O
of	O
how	O
to	O
construct	O
anything	O
for	O
me	O
was	O
basic	O
shapes	O
which	O
was	O
fundamentals	O
was	O
understanding	O
how	O
to	O
break	O
things	O
down	O
into	O
a	O
simplest	O
form	O
and	O
rebuild	O
it	O
you	O
know	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
something	O
as	O
complicated	O
as	O
a	O
charge	O
building	O
or	O
simple	O
as	O
hairstyles	O
you	O
know	O
like	O
something	O
like	O
this	O
you	O
could	O
look	O
at	O
an	O
image	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
can	O
reconstruct	O
it	O
the	O
way	O
you	O
want	O
because	O
your	O
brain	O
is	O
breaking	O
it	O
down	O
into	O
basic	O
shapes	O
and	O
you're	O
redrawing	O
it	O
hair	O
is	O
not	O
individual	O
strands	O
hair	O
is	O
a	O
mass	O
you	O
hear	O
this	O
a	O
lot	O
but	O
even	O
up	O
on	O
you	O
even	O
though	O
even	O
though	O
you	O
hear	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O
people	O
still	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
every	O
single	O
time	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
will	O
you	O
will	O
catch	O

when	O
you	O
first	O

if	O
you	O

yourself	O
you	O
will	O
you	O
will	O
you	O
will	O
hate	O
every	O
bit	O
of	O
her	O
you	O
draw	O
back	O
in	O
the	O
back	O
in	O
the	O
90s	O
people	O
just	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
ok	O
to	O
draw	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
if	O
I	O
mean	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
was	O
the	O
90s	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
did	O
in	O
the	O
90s	O
where	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
would	O
draw	O
and	O
then	O
what	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
is	O
we	O
would	O
draw	O
the	O
shape	O
of	O
ahead	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
we	O
get	O
our	O
details	O
down	O
our	O
face	O
or	O
whatever	O
you	O
know	O
just	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
rough	O
in	O
some	O
face	O
or	O
features	O
but	O
then	O
what	O
we	O
would	O
do	O
is	O
we	O
would	O
just	O
sculpt	O
out	O
our	O
hairstyles	O
and	O
we	O
would	O
always	O
be	O
like	O
why	O
isn't	O
our	O
hair	O
looking	O
good	O
why	O
does	O
it	O
here	O
always	O
look	O
like	O
crap	O
and	O
looks	O
overly	O
rendered	O
in	O
it	O
at	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
it	O
looks	O
like	O
it's	O
not	O
rendered	O
at	O
all	O
young	O
with	O
that	O
concept	O
right	O
where	O
it	O
looks	O
like	O
you	O
overly	O
rendered	O
something	O
but	O
it	O
just	O
looks	O
like	O
it's	O
not	O
finished	O
that	O
early	O
80s	O
like	O
gi	O
joe	O
I	O
don't	O
necessarily	O
know	O
what	O
you	O
wanna	O
call	O
it	O
kind	O
of	O
here	O
where	O
it	O
just	O
it	O
looked	O
it	O
just	O
it	O
looked	O
like	O
hanna	O
barbera	O
if	O
anybody	O
knows	O
ahead	O
of	O
barbera	O
cartoons	O
are	O
it	O
just	O
looked	O
like	O
everything	O
just	O
looked	O
like	O
finished	O
with	O
nothing	O
but	O
I	O
didn't	O
like	O
how	O
to	O
barbera	O
cartoons	O
you	O
know	O
but	O
that's	O
the	O
thing	O
is	O
like	O
when	O
you're	O
drawing	O
her	O
that's	O
something	O
that	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
remember	O
is	O
hair	O
is	O
a	O
giant	O
mass	O
of	O
shapes	O
you	O
know	O
or	O
a	O
giant	O
mass	O
of	O
a	O
sheep	O
you	O
know	O
this	O
is	O
generally	O
what	O
your	O
this	O
is	O
generally	O
what	O
your	O
hairstyle	O
is	O
you	O
know	O
when	O
you	O
sit	O
down	O
to	O
draw	O
a	O
hairstyle	O
this	O
is	O
generally	O
what	O
you're	O
looking	O
for	O
right	O
there	O
just	O
this	O
this	O
is	O
this	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
hairstyle	O
and	O
then	O
you	O
go	O
in	O
and	O
you	O
add	O
a	O
few	O
details	O
to	O
show	O
direction	O
you're	O
high	O
you're	O
high	O

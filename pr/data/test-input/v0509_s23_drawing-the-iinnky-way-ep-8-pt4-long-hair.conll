I	O
just	O
thought	O
this	O
do	O
with	O
so	O
cool	O
so	O
now	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
son	O
name	O
alexander	O
by	O
just	O
the	O
sheer	O
coincidence	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
like	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
steal	O
this	O
guys	O
thunder	O
you	O
know	O
so	O
but	O
this	O
guy	O
was	O
like	O
every	O
time	O
I	O
would	O
try	O
to	O
catch	O
him	O
he	O
would	O
jump	O
it	O
2	O
steps	O
ahead	O
of	O
me	O
again	O
by	O
doing	O
something	O
different	O
or	O
something	O
new	O
like	O
and	O
he	O
would	O
just	O
read	O
a	O
book	O
or	O
you	O
know	O
watch	O
a	O
video	O
or	O
something	O
like	O
that	O
and	O
then	O
be	O
obsessed	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
then	O
within	O
like	O
a	O
month	O
he	O
would	O
be	O
doing	O
whatever	O
it	O
was	O
knew	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
do	O
and	O
I	O
used	O
to	O
always	O
be	O
like	O
damn	O
never	O
I'm	O
never	O
gonna	O
catch	O
this	O
guy	O
and	O
then	O
I	O
started	O
realizing	O
like	O
why	O
am	O
I	O
why	O
am	O
I	O
always	O
competing	O
and	O
why	O
am	O
I	O
always	O
chasing	O
someone	O
else	O
in	O
art	O
why	O
is	O
it	O
why	O
is	O
it	O
this	O
thing	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
just	O
be	O
better	O
than	O
somebody	O
else	O
or	O
be	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
somebody	O
else	O
why	O
am	O
I	O
so	O
concerned	O
with	O
being	O
accepted	O
or	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
level	O
as	O
someone	O
else	O
when	O
we	O
don't	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
you	O
can't	O
possibly	O
be	O
like	O
someone	O
else	O
if	O
you	O
aren't	O
in	O
the	O
same	O
brain	O
or	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
level	O
as	O
they	O
are	O
as	O
far	O
as	O
like	O
what	O
they	O
know	O
if	O
if	O
that	O
person	O
gave	O
you	O
a	O
concept	O
to	O
draw	O
your	O
concept	O
would	O
not	O
be	O
the	O
concept	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
draw	O
or	O
she	O
would	O
draw	O
it	O
would	O
always	O
be	O
different	O
because	O
your	O
experiences	O
are	O
different	O
your	O
brain	O
is	O
wired	O
different	O
you	O
just	O
cannot	O
produce	O
the	O
same	O
kind	O
of	O
art	O
even	O
if	O
you	O
look	O
at	O
it	O
and	O
you	O
do	O
a	O
one	O
for	O
one	O
replica	O
of	O
it	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
you	O
extremely	O
long	O
to	O
do	O
something	O
at	O
that	O
person	O
just	O
did	O
effortlessly	O
so	O
when	O
you	O
draw	O
it	O
like	O
so	O
say	O
I'm	O
drawing	O
this	O
hair	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
hairstyles	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
right	O
if	O
someone	O
sat	O
there	O
and	O
try	O
to	O
understand	O
the	O
style	O
in	O
which	O
I	O
was	O
drawing	O
my	O
hair	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
them	O
at	O
least	O
two	O
or	O
three	O
times	O
longer	O
than	O
me	O
because	O
I'm	O
just	O
doing	O
it	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
I	O
draw	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
convince	O
myself	O
of	O
how	O
I	O
did	O
this	O
or	O
try	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
my	O
subtle	O
nuances	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
it's	O
just	O
how	O
I	O
draw	O
it's	O
like	O
when	O
I	O
sit	O
my	O
pencil	O
on	O
the	O
paper	O
my	O
brain	O
is	O
making	O
up	O
things	O
that	O
I	O
like	O
and	O
putting	O
them	O
together	O
the	O
way	O
that	O
I	O
liked	O
him	O
that's	O
what	O
my	O
brain	O
is	O
doing	O
as	O
well	O
that's	O
how	O
I'm	O
operating	O
a	O
next	O
is	O
generally	O
how	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
stuff	O
works	O
I'm	O
just	O
literally	O
sitting	O
there	O
piecing	O
together	O
how	O
I	O
like	O
things	O
like	O
from	O
the	O
nose	O
to	O
the	O
eyes	O
too	O
wide	O
I	O
choose	O
to	O
draw	O
her	O
face	O
in	O
this	O
position	O
to	O
get	O
this	O
hairstyle	O
when	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
drawn	O
it	O
in	O
any	O
other	O
position	O
why	O
this	O
position	O
you	O
know	O
why	O
did	O
I	O
put	O
a	O
bow	O
in	O
the	O
hair	O
why	O
am	O
I	O
putting	O
curls	O
all	O
over	O
the	O
place	O
why	O
am	O
I	O
doing	O
any	O
of	O
this	O
stuff	O
that's	O
because	O
my	O
brain	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
my	O
brain	O
likes	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
my	O
brain	O
is	O
telling	O
me	O
to	O
do	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
this	O
is	O
where	O
my	O
brain	O
is	O
telling	O
me	O
to	O
put	O
this	O
little	O
curly	O
cue	O
my	O
brain	O

me	O
to	O

not	O
quite	O
balances	O
nothing	O
wrong	O
you	O
just	O
gotta	O
remember	O
paintings	O
go	O
through	O
a	O
phase	O
and	O
you	O
gotta	O
work	O
work	O
your	O
way	O
through	O
that	O
hi	O
baby	O
hi	O
robert	O
morning	O
mattie	O
how's	O
the	O
weather	O
over	O
there	O
in	O
netherlands	O
we	O
had	O
some	O
wonderful	O
storms	O
last	O
night	O
in	O
central	O
uk	O
we've	O
been	O
having	O
a	O
pretty	O
good	O
weather	O
right	O
now	O
it's	O
like	O
partly	O
cloudy	O
there's	O
a	O
bit	O
of	O
sun	O
and	O
it's	O
pretty	O
warm	O
so	O
no	O
complaints	O
we've	O
had	O
this	O
these	O
we've	O
had	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
threat	O
of	O
thunderstorms	O
lately	O
but	O
then	O
they	O
don't	O
actually	O
we	O
haven't	O
actually	O
had	O
them	O
like	O
there's	O
been	O
a	O
couple	O
days	O
recently	O
that	O
the	O
weather	O
report	O
was	O
saying	O
we	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
expect	O
really	O
really	O
stormy	O
weather	O
but	O
it	O
never	O
came	O
through	O
which	O
is	O
kind	O
of	O
sad	O
'cause	O
I	O
enjoy	O
a	O
good	O
thunderstorm	O
here	O
and	O
there	O
but	O
not	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
exactly	O
judy	O
that's	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
so	O
I'm	O
still	O
focusing	O
on	O
gradients	O
and	O
blocking	O
in	O
of	O
colors	O
not	O
individual	O
plants	O
yet	O
we're	O
still	O
in	O
that	O
trying	O
to	O
visualize	O
this	O
as	O
if	O
we	O
had	O
taken	O
off	O
our	O
glasses	O
and	O
we're	O
seeing	O
like	O
a	O
blurred	O
version	O
of	O
reality	O
or	O
still	O
in	O
that	O
phase	O
and	O
then	O
when	O
everything	O
is	O
finally	O
in	O
place	O
like	O
when	O
all	O
the	O
basic	O
shadows	O
are	O
in	O
the	O
right	O
spot	O
then	O
we'll	O
take	O
it	O
to	O
the	O
next	O
level	O
and	O
start	O
actually	O
painting	O
grass	O
is	O
and	O
like	O
little	O
moss	O
details	O
and	O
things	O
like	O
that	O
can	O
I	O
use	O
it	O
in	O
adobe	O
xdo	O
pure	O
ref	O
so	O
pure	O
ref	O
is	O
is	O
it	O
a	O
separate	O
app	O
it's	O
not	O
a	O
plugin	O
so	O
the	O
cool	O
thing	O
is	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
it	O
with	O
like	O
any	O
program	O
you	O
can	O
even	O
have	O
it	O
open	O
a	O
window	O
that	O
says	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
your	O
web	O
browser	O
anything	O
it's	O
not	O
necessarily	O
attached	O
a	O
photo	O
shop	O
in	O
anyway	O
I	O
just	O
use	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
paint	O
so	O
I'm	O
usually	O
using	O
it	O
when	O
I	O
use	O
photo	O
shop	O
but	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
it	O
with	O
anything	O
hey	O
claire	O
z	O
oh	O
I'm	O
so	O
happy	O
for	O
you	O
then	O
I	O
hope	O
you	O
enjoyed	O
the	O
thunderstorms	O
yeah	O
it's	O
just	O
nice	O
cozy	O
type	O
of	O
whether	O
to	O
stay	O
inside	O
and	O
paint	O
or	O
work	O
on	O
things	O
I	O
always	O
enjoy	O
thunderstorms	O
alright	O
so	O
I	O
just	O
wanted	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
darker	O
value	O
in	O
the	O
corner	O
here	O
but	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
find	O
the	O
right	O
color	O
because	O
I	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
a	O
deep	O
saturated	O
blue	O
a	O
green	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
towards	O
blue	O
I	O
don't	O
want	O
a	O
dirty	O
muddy	O
green	O
ok	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
now	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
start	O
working	O
on	O
the	O
tree	O
stump	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
desaturated	O
color	O
it's	O
not	O
brown	O
like	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
trees	O
tree	O
stumps	O
that	O
you	O
see	O
so	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
go	O
for	O
this	O
grayish	O
color	O
I	O
mean	O
we	O
could	O
always	O
use	O
some	O
artistic	O
license	O
and	O
paint	O
it	O
differently	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
it's	O
nice	O
how	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
contrast	O
to	O
the	O
environment	O
if	O
we	O
go	O
with	O
a	O
brown	O
color	O
would	O
then	O
I	O
think	O
it'll	O
blend	O
into	O
the	O
grass	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
value	O
wise	O
so	O
will	O
stick	O
with	O
this	O
pamodzi	O
are	O
good	O
to	O
see	O
you	O
oh	O
you're	O
welcome	O
I'm	O
at	O
I'm	O
happy	O
it	O
helps	O
so	O
on	O
a	O
new	O
layer	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
select	O
a	O
color	O
for	O
this	O
for	O
this	O
would	O
and	O
I	O
tried	O
not	O
color	O
picking	O
from	O
the	O
reference	O
so	O
sometimes	O
it	O
takes	O
me	O
awhile	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
what	O
color	O
something	O
is	O
if	O
we	O
really	O
can't	O
figure	O
it	O
out	O
it's	O
best	O
to	O
just	O
color	O
pick	O
and	O
see	O
what	O
the	O
answer	O
is	O
so	O
let's	O
see	O
actually	O
wasn't	O
like	O
horribly	O
far	O
off	O
with	O
that	O
last	O
selection	O
but	O
basically	O
looks	O
like	O
on	O
the	O
left	O
we	O
have	O
like	O
an	O
off	O
white	O
color	O
that's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
warmer	O
like	O
a	O
yellowish	O
color	O
and	O
then	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
stump	O
we've	O
got	O
a	O
gray	O
that	O
has	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
a	O
blue	O
green	O
color	O
can	O
you	O
see	O
that	O
so	O
that's	O
what	O
we	O
want	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O
mind	O
so	O
there's	O
a	O
couple	O
ways	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
think	O
of	O
what's	O
the	O
best	O
way	O
to	O
paint	O
this	O
in	O
'cause	O
if	O
I'm	O
going	O
for	O
a	O
watercolor	O
looks	O
then	O
making	O
all	O
these	O
paint	O
strokes	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
that's	O
just	O
not	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
it	O

I	O
will	O
under	O
timer	O
fancy	O
yeah	O
I'm	O
excited	O
for	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
like	O
fully	O
out	O
and	O
shared	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
mean	O
time	O
I'm	O
testing	O
it	O
ok	O
I	O
will	O
lower	O
the	O
opacity	O
of	O
the	O
sketch	O
layer	O
now	O
because	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
in	O
with	O
a	O
lighter	O
flat	O
color	O
I	O
can	O
see	O
everything	O
so	O
will	O
tone	O
that	O
down	O
so	O
it's	O
not	O
distracting	O
and	O
looking	O
at	O
the	O
reference	O
so	O
here's	O
my	O
watercolor	O
brush	O
and	O
what	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
do	O
is	O
just	O
give	O
this	O
gradient	O
of	O
shading	O
within	O
this	O
one	O
shape	O
and	O
kind	O
of	O
pretend	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
just	O
like	O
one	O
big	O
watercolor	O
wash	O
that's	O
going	O
on	O
here	O
so	O
we'll	O
choose	O
a	O
warmer	O
color	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
shadows	O
it	O
seems	O
like	O
everything	O
on	O
the	O
left	O
side	O
is	O
just	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
these	O
warmer	O
details	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
right	O
we	O
have	O
the	O
colour	O
details	O
then	O
just	O
kind	O
of	O
flow	O
between	O
them	O
um	O
hi	O
are	O
there	O
how	O
are	O
you	O
I	O
hope	O
I'm	O
saying	O
your	O
name	O
right	O
you	O
can	O
correct	O
me	O
if	O
I'm	O
if	O
I'm	O
not	O
missing	O
anything	O
else	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
peek	O
at	O
my	O
painting	O
in	O
black	O
and	O
white	O
and	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
with	O
the	O
reference	O
because	O
I'm	O
a	O
little	O
confused	O
with	O
how	O
bright	O
this	O
should	O
be	O
so	O
what	O
we	O
will	O
do	O
is	O
take	O
a	O
peek	O
over	O
here	O
oook	O
at	O
that	O
ok	O
so	O
i've	O
just	O
started	O
with	O
this	O
so	O
it's	O
clearly	O
we	O
have	O
a	O
ways	O
to	O
go	O
but	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
in	O
the	O
end	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
get	O
brighter	O
areas	O
in	O
the	O
grass	O
and	O
just	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
contrast	O
pure	O
f	O
is	O
not	O
free	O
it	O
is	O
it	O
is	O
you	O
can	O
put	O
you	O
can	O
choose	O
to	O
put	O
$0.00	O
when	O
you	O
download	O
it	O
they	O
give	O
you	O
the	O
option	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
donation	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
but	O
it's	O
not	O
a	O
requirement	O
yes	O
they've	O
changed	O
something	O
in	O
like	O
the	O
last	O
week	O
it	O
is	O
free	O
but	O
it's	O
a	O
little	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
confusing	O
because	O
they	O
up	O
the	O
donation	O
thing	O
but	O
you	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
donation	O
yeah	O
check	O
one	O
more	O
time	O
so	O
yeah	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
add	O
more	O
highlights	O
in	O
the	O
grass	O
is	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
turn	O
your	O
painting	O
in	O
a	O
black	O
and	O
white	O
like	O
that	O
you	O
can	O
set	O
up	O
a	O
shortcut	O
that	O
will	O
do	O
it	O
really	O
easy	O
and	O
it's	O
very	O
useful	O
you	O
can	O
go	O
to	O
view	O
proof	O
setup	O
custom	O
so	O
view	O
proof	O
setup	O
custom	O
and	O
then	O
under	O
the	O
drop	O
down	O
here	O
for	O
proof	O
conditions	O
you	O
just	O
set	O
the	O
device	O
to	O
simulate	O
to	O
working	O
gray	O
gain	O
20	O
just	O
like	O
this	O
from	O

then	O
anytime	O

to	O
being	O

hey	O
you	O
guys	O
how	O
are	O
you	O
welcome	O
alright	O
so	O
we	O
need	O
to	O
continue	O
on	O
with	O
getting	O
some	O
shadows	O
in	O
the	O
the	O
white	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
the	O
the	O
bark	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
be	O
really	O
careful	O
with	O
how	O
dark	O
I	O
go	O
for	O
these	O
shadows	O
because	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
different	O
different	O
shadows	O
and	O
curves	O
that	O
have	O
these	O
sort	O
of	O
dirty	O
looking	O
details	O
in	O
the	O
wood	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
but	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
keep	O
I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
very	O
very	O
dark	O
value	O
wise	O
because	O
then	O
suddenly	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
way	O
too	O
high	O
contrast	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
we're	O
on	O
a	O
good	O
path	O
here	O
um	O
when	O
I	O
can	O
I'm	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
merging	O
this	O
down	O
onto	O
the	O
layer	O
with	O
all	O
the	O
green	O
and	O
everything	O
I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
sort	O
of	O
paint	O
freely	O
over	O
this	O
and	O
have	O
have	O
everything	O
on	O
one	O
layer	O
alright	O
good	O
luck	O
on	O
that	O
I	O
hope	O
it	O
works	O
out	O
ok	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
hope	O
this	O
isn't	O
a	O
mistake	O
but	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
merge	O
it	O

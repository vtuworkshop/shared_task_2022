I	O
think	O
that	O
I	O
painted	O
everything	O
that	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
with	O
the	O
layer	O
separately	O
like	O
that	O
big	O
wash	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
wanting	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
now	O
i'll	O
merge	O
it	O
down	O
so	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
we	O
have	O
right	O
now	O
this	O
layer	O
and	O
the	O
sketch	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
it	O
so	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
new	O
layer	O
in	O
between	O
those	O
and	O
I	O
want	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
start	O
actually	O
wonder	O
if	O
I	O
can	O
use	O
this	O
much	O
brush	O
here	O
I	O
kind	O
of	O
want	O
a	O
softer	O
transition	O
and	O
I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
sludging	O
or	O
painting	O
on	O
top	O
is	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
let's	O
try	O
painting	O
on	O
top	O
alright	O
nice	O
I'm	O
glad	O
I'm	O
glad	O
you	O
got	O
it	O
working	O
yeah	O
I	O
hope	O
you	O
enjoy	O
it	O
see	O
now	O
having	O
just	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
green	O
details	O
coming	O
up	O
in	O
front	O
of	O
the	O
the	O
tree	O
stump	O
is	O
making	O
it	O
look	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
natural	O
and	O
not	O
like	O
it's	O
just	O
pasted	O
in	O
there	O
but	O
that	O
things	O
are	O
actually	O
growing	O
around	O
it	O
and	O
it's	O
kind	O
of	O
settled	O
in	O
nestled	O
in	O
here	O
alright	O
let's	O
paint	O
in	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
the	O
area	O
near	O
the	O
water	O
so	O
we've	O
got	O
some	O
purple	O
ish	O
details	O
it's	O
just	O
there	O
the	O
mud	O
and	O
dirt	O
and	O
little	O
twigs	O
next	O
to	O
the	O
water	O
I'm	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
actually	O
using	O
some	O
hard	O
edges	O
in	O
this	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
important	O
to	O
kind	O
of	O
move	O
from	O
like	O
a	O
vague	O
softness	O
to	O
more	O
specific	O
um	O
harder	O
edges	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
gotta	O
keep	O
sticking	O
with	O
soft	O
edges	O
first	O
time	O
for	O
a	O
little	O
while	O
longer	O
while	O
you	O
merge	O
layers	O
well	O
there's	O
a	O
couple	O
reasons	O
mainly	O
I	O
merge	O
layers	O
because	O
it	O
helps	O
me	O
get	O
a	O
more	O
traditional	O
style	O
look	O
to	O
my	O
painting	O
part	O
I	O
think	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
reason	O
is	O
just	O
because	O
in	O
traditional	O
art	O
you	O
don't	O
have	O
all	O
these	O
layers	O
available	O
so	O
kind	O
of	O
having	O
things	O
together	O
puts	O
me	O
more	O
in	O
the	O
mentals	O
they	O
bed	O
yeah	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
what	O
it	O
is	O
but	O
it's	O
I	O
find	O
that	O
I	O
get	O
more	O
in	O
an	O
easy	O
flow	O
when	O
I'm	O
painting	O
because	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
select	O
through	O
like	O
let's	O
say	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
paint	O
something	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
this	O
tree	O
stump	O
so	O
was	O
on	O
a	O
separate	O
layer	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
to	O
decide	O
between	O
do	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
erase	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
stumps	O
you	O
see	O
thru	O
below	O
it	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
paint	O
on	O
a	O
layer	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
it	O
do	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
switch	O
all	O
through	O
all	O
these	O
layers	O
and	O
it	O
just	O
becomes	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
complicated	O
when	O
there's	O
less	O
layers	O
I	O
feel	O
like	O
I	O
can	O
just	O
paint	O
on	O
top	O
of	O
stuff	O
where	O
I	O
want	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
and	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
to	O
make	O
so	O
many	O
decisions	O
and	O
sort	O
of	O
weed	O
through	O
different	O
layers	O
and	O
things	O
but	O
there's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
benefits	O
to	O
keeping	O
things	O
on	O
separate	O
layers	O
as	O
well	O
sometimes	O
things	O
are	O
easier	O
to	O
change	O
I'm	O
so	O
sorry	O
I'm	O
expecting	O
something	O
I	O
think	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
package	O
i'll	O
be	O
right	O
back	O
sorry	O
about	O
this	O
guys	O
hey	O
guys	O
I'm	O
sorry	O
about	O
that	O

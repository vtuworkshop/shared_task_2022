yeah	O
we	O
were	O
expecting	O
expecting	O
a	O
package	O
it's	O
not	O
it's	O
it's	O
for	O
my	O
boyfriend	O
is	O
not	O
for	O
me	O
he	O
got	O
something	O
for	O
set	O
up	O
something	O
for	O
his	O
computer	O
I	O
know	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
bring	O
it	O
in	O
math	O
yeah	O
I	O
already	O
ordered	O
way	O
too	O
many	O
paints	O
recently	O
it	O
wasn't	O
me	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
swear	O
anyway	O
thank	O
you	O
guys	O
um	O
yeah	O
you	O
can	O
use	O
groups	O
there	O
are	O
different	O
ways	O
you	O
can	O
get	O
around	O
if	O
you	O
prefer	O
to	O
keep	O
your	O
layers	O
separate	O
it's	O
very	O
much	O
a	O
personal	O
preference	O
thing	O
when	O
I'm	O
doing	O
a	O
quick	O
studies	O
I	O
usually	O
just	O
go	O
ahead	O
and	O
merge	O
things	O
if	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
work	O
for	O
a	O
client	O
where	O
they	O
might	O
want	O
me	O
to	O
change	O
things	O
and	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
safe	O
and	O
know	O
that	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
can	O
easily	O
change	O
things	O
if	O
they	O
ask	O
me	O
too	O
then	O
I	O
might	O
keep	O
players	O
separate	O
and	O
be	O
more	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
careful	O
about	O
merging	O
but	O
it's	O
it's	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
personal	O
preference	O
I'm	O
certainly	O
not	O
saying	O
that	O
everyone	O
needs	O
to	O
work	O
like	O
this	O
I	O
know	O
it's	O
kind	O
of	O
a	O
maybe	O
a	O
little	O
unusual	O
compared	O
to	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
work	O
but	O
I	O
just	O
found	O
it	O
it	O
made	O
me	O
a	O
lot	O
faster	O
not	O
worrying	O
about	O
what	O
layer	O
things	O
were	O
on	O
a	O
fishing	O
through	O
them	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
jazz	O
ok	O
so	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
add	O
some	O
moss	O
harry's	O
new	O
so	O
then	O
last	O
has	O
a	O
very	O
bright	O
green	O
saturated	O
look	O
and	O
it's	O
these	O
cute	O
little	O
rounded	O
tufts	O
so	O
I'm	O
trying	O
to	O
select	O
a	O
lighter	O
color	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
these	O
little	O
tough	O
this	O
is	O
very	O
bright	O
but	O
that's	O
ok	O
will	O
work	O
with	O
it	O
and	O
even	O
a	O
little	O
warm	O
goldish	O
color	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
nice	O
oh	O
welcome	O
reach	O
new	O
thanks	O
for	O
being	O
here	O
and	O
then	O
then	O
you	O
on	O
high	O
I	O
hope	O
from	O
seeing	O
your	O
name	O
ok	O
welcome	O
on	O
in	O
san	O
jose	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
confidence	O
important	O
I	O
don't	O
understand	O
what	O
you're	O
asking	O
I'm	O
sorry	O
are	O
you	O
talking	O
about	O
my	O
painting	O
ok	O
so	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
move	O
into	O
some	O
hard	O
edges	O
soon	O
hi	O
catherine	O
how	O
are	O
you	O
and	O
I	O
just	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
over	O
any	O
of	O
these	O
bottom	O
edges	O
of	O
the	O
tree	O
stumps	O
that	O
are	O
that	O
are	O
hard	O
'cause	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
looks	O
better	O
if	O
there's	O
little	O
tufts	O
of	O
grass	O
coming	O
up	O
over	O
the	O
top	O
and	O
you	O
can	O
have	O
hard	O
edges	O
facing	O
upward	O
and	O
that's	O
fine	O
alright	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
can	O
turn	O
off	O
the	O
sketch	O
layer	O
now	O
'cause	O
if	O
you	O
see	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
got	O
everything	O
blocked	O
in	O
that	O
was	O
that	O
the	O
sketch	O
was	O
there	O
to	O
tell	O
us	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
I	O
don't	O
really	O
need	O
that	O
anymore	O
so	O
i'll	O
turn	O
off	O
the	O
schedule	O
later	O
will	O
still	O
keep	O
it	O
there	O
just	O
in	O
case	O
sometimes	O
I	O
get	O
confused	O
later	O
and	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
go	O
back	O
to	O
my	O
sketch	O
and	O
remember	O
remember	O
what	O
my	O
original	O
goal	O
was	O
but	O
I	O
think	O
we	O
can	O
turn	O
off	O
that	O
layer	O
for	O
a	O
bit	O
so	O
we're	O
getting	O
towards	O
the	O
part	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
looking	O
forward	O
to	O
and	O
that	O
is	O
some	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
putting	O
in	O
some	O
more	O
details	O
before	O
I	O
do	O
that	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
make	O
a	O
new	O
layer	O
so	O
what	O
i'll	O
do	O
is	O
i'll	O
merge	O
down	O
what	O
I	O
have	O
here	O

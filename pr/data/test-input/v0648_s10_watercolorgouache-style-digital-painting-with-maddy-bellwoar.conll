if	O
we	O
really	O
want	O
to	O
we	O
can	O
duplicate	O
the	O
background	O
layer	O
sometimes	O
i'll	O
do	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
thing	O
so	O
i'll	O
save	O
2	O
versions	O
it's	O
fun	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
make	O
like	O
a	O
step-by-step	O
sheet	O
later	O
and	O
show	O
your	O
processor	O
process	O
then	O
you	O
can	O
see	O
that	O
stuff	O
but	O
will	O
make	O
a	O
new	O
layer	O
I'm	O
going	O
to	O
put	O
this	O
layer	O
on	O
multiply	O
blending	O
mode	O
and	O
use	O
an	O
airbrush	O
just	O
the	O
basic	O
airbrush	O
and	O
what	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
here	O
is	O
make	O
my	O
airbrush	O
really	O
large	O
and	O
use	O
it	O
to	O
add	O
some	O
shading	O
for	O
example	O
the	O
background	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
darker	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
put	O
a	O
price	O
on	O
your	O
artwork	O
well	O
that's	O
a	O
difficult	O
thing	O
there's	O
some	O
different	O
things	O
you	O
can	O
take	O
into	O
account	O
for	O
pricing	O
work	O
so	O
if	O
I'm	O
there's	O
also	O
how	O
do	O
you	O
price	O
and	O
artwork	O
to	O
sell	O
that	O
you	O
created	O
versus	O
a	O
commission	O
so	O
if	O
you	O
create	O
something	O
you're	O
selling	O
it	O
versus	O
somebody's	O
asking	O
you	O
to	O
paint	O
something	O
specific	O
that	O
can	O
be	O
different	O
price	O
I'm	O
doing	O
good	O
got	O
some	O
thank	O
you	O
I	O
uh	O
now	O
you	O
can	O
consider	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
different	O
things	O
if	O
you're	O
working	O
traditionally	O
then	O
you	O
of	O
course	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
also	O
consider	O
the	O
cost	O
of	O
materials	O
of	O
the	O
paper	O
and	O
paint	O
and	O
all	O
that	O
but	O
either	O
way	O
if	O
you're	O
doing	O
digital	O
or	O
traditional	O
you	O
have	O
to	O
look	O
at	O
how	O
many	O
hours	O
you're	O
putting	O
into	O
your	O
work	O
and	O
the	O
difficulty	O
level	O
like	O
if	O
somebody	O
is	O
commissioning	O
you	O
to	O
do	O
a	O
portrait	O
that's	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
very	O
different	O
price	O
than	O
a	O
whole	O
environment	O
scene	O
with	O
a	O
battle	O
and	O
multiple	O
characters	O
an	O
all	O
this	O
dynamic	O
action	O
poses	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
so	O
there's	O
a	O
lot	O
to	O
think	O
about	O
claire	O
she	O
says	O
put	O
up	O
a	O
random	O
question	O
but	O
on	O
layers	O
where	O
do	O
you	O
have	O
color	O
dodge	O
etc	O
what	O
does	O
divide	O
do	O
sometimes	O
it	O
just	O
feels	O
perfect	O
for	O
what	O
I'm	O
doing	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
what	O
actually	O
does	O
that's	O
so	O
interesting	O
I	O
actually	O
have	O
never	O
used	O
that	O
layer	O
blending	O
mode	O
divide	O
that's	O
so	O
cool	O
maybe	O
i'll	O
try	O
it	O
out	O
more	O
I	O
yeah	O
I	O
don't	O
have	O
an	O
answer	O
unfortunately	O
just	O
because	O
I	O
that's	O
not	O
one	O
that's	O
in	O
my	O
my	O
rotation	O
usually	O
I	O
use	O
I	O
use	O
color	O
dodge	O
multiply	O
overlay	O
I	O
use	O
dark	O
and	O
light	O
and	O
a	O
lot	O
but	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
not	O
so	O
much	O
divide	O
dividing	O
your	O
page	O
what	O
you	O
know	O
I	O
wish	O
it	O
boyfriend	O
was	O
here	O
he	O
would	O
know	O
he	O
knows	O
all	O
this	O
scientific	O
information	O
about	O
the	O
layer	O
blending	O
modes	O
i'll	O
try	O
to	O
ask	O
him	O
next	O
time	O
that	O
I	O
see	O
him	O
in	O
stream	O
he	O
was	O
explaining	O
about	O
the	O
other	O
day	O
to	O
me	O
about	O
overlay	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
but	O
I'm	O
sorry	O
I	O
can't	O
be	O
more	O
specific	O
with	O
an	O
answer	O
for	O
you	O
sano	O
as	O
you	O
get	O
more	O
experienced	O
you	O
can	O
charge	O
more	O
as	O
well	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
lot	O
to	O
do	O
also	O
with	O
your	O
you	O
know	O
the	O
artist	O
skill	O
level	O
and	O
how	O
in	O
demand	O
they	O
are	O
and	O
stuff	O
like	O
that	O
those	O
are	O
those	O
are	O
things	O
that	O
are	O
important	O
too	O
but	O
that	O
being	O
said	O
even	O
a	O
beginner	O
artist	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
you	O
should	O
ever	O
under	O
charge	O
for	O
your	O
work	O
I	O
don't	O
think	O
you	O
should	O
ever	O
be	O
getting	O
paid	O
less	O
than	O
minimum	O
wage	O
for	O
example	O
to	O
do	O
artwork	O
that's	O
that	O
that's	O
not	O
right	O
and	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
artists	O
under	O
charge	O
for	O
their	O
work	O
I	O
think	O
you	O
got	O
them	O
I	O
appreciate	O
that	O
so	O
we	O
added	O
a	O
little	O
extra	O
shading	O
we	O
can	O
also	O
do	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
with	O
highlights	O
so	O
i'll	O
make	O
a	O
new	O
layer	O
and	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
color	O
dodge	O
grab	O
the	O
airbrush	O
ann	O
just	O
like	O
we	O
added	O
some	O
shadow	O
we	O
can	O
add	O
highlights	O
so	O
I	O
don't	O
know	O
color	O
dodge	O
is	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
right	O
choice	O
maybe	O
overlays	O
is	O
better	O
but	O
basically	O
I	O
want	O
the	O
idea	O
that	O
there's	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
light	O
hitting	O
back	O
here	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
might	O
kind	O
of	O
change	O
up	O
the	O
lighting	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
from	O
the	O
reference	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
fun	O
strange	O
shenanigans	O
says	O
according	O
to	O
adobe	O
looks	O
at	O
the	O
color	O
information	O
in	O
each	O
channel	O
and	O
divides	O
the	O
blend	O
color	O
from	O
the	O
base	O
color	O
thank	O
you	O
for	O
looking	O
that	O
up	O
I	O
am	O
I	O
hate	O
that	O
it's	O
like	O
I	O
understand	O
I'm	O
like	O
reading	O
it	O
but	O
it	O
doesn't	O
this	O
still	O
doesn't	O
it's	O
not	O
quite	O
know	O
what	O
that	O
means	O
I	O
understand	O
like	O
the	O
base	O
color	O
oh	O
the	O
blend	O
color	O
must	O
be	O
the	O
color	O
of	O
your	O
painting	O
with	O
that's	O
very	O
interesting	O
do	O
you	O
think	O
extra	O
brush	O
yes	O
below	O
my	O
stream	O
in	O
the	O
description	O
you	O
can	O
find	O
some	O
links	O
to	O
my	O
brushes	O
so	O
I	O
was	O
thinking	O
about	O
having	O
like	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
of	O
light	O
pop	O
in	O
the	O
scene	O
over	O
here	O
but	O
I	O
can't	O
decide	O
if	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
or	O
if	O
I	O
want	O
to	O
just	O
keep	O
it	O
like	O
sort	O
of	O
an	O
overcast	O
feeling	O
maybe	O
that's	O
better	O
ok	O
well	O
I'm	O
glad	O
chat	O
knows	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
about	O
about	O
it	O
thanks	O
you	O
guys	O
